There are bigger villains in the world than Elon Musk. While he has a long history of [wrecking lives](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/28/tesla-female-engineer-lawsuit-harassment-discrimination)—from [the Tesla whistleblower](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-03-13/when-elon-musk-tried-to-destroy-tesla-whistleblower-martin-tripp) on whom he sicced the police to the janitorial staff whose [contract he terminated](https://newrepublic.com/post/169313/twitter-janitors-striking-laid-off-no-warning) before the holidays—he has not, like Vladimir Putin, invaded a country simply because he wants it. And there are larger fools too. Crypto-fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried [lost an even greater portion of his net worth](https://newrepublic.com/article/169486/sam-bankman-fried-fool-fraud) in 2022, all while convincing some ostensibly intelligent pundits that “[effective altruism](https://newrepublic.com/article/168885/bankman-fried-effective-altruism-bunk)” was a thing distinct from “another means of plutocratic tax avoidance.” But Musk is the most titanic nimrod alive today, hands down. 

世界上还有比埃隆·马斯克更大的恶棍。尽管他有着长期破坏生命的历史--从他向警察告发的特斯拉（Tesla）举报人到他在节日前终止合同的清洁工--但他并不像弗拉基米尔·普京（Vladimir Putin）那样，仅仅因为自己想要入侵一个国家就入侵。而且还有更大的傻瓜。密码欺诈者萨姆·班克曼-弗里德（Sam Bankman-Fried）在2022年损失了更大一部分净资产，同时让一些表面上聪明的专家相信，“有效的利他主义”不同于“富豪避税的另一种手段”。但毫无疑问，马斯克是当今最伟大的尼姆罗德。

That’s the inevitable conclusion after witnessing his acquisition of Twitter and the fecal mess he has made there ever since. He spent [$44 billion of his own money](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html) to own the libs, but instead it looks, with each passing day, like he [engineered his own duping](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2022/11/23/elon-musk-tesla-stock-twitter/?sh=2bdf95e86f81). He’s saddled with a [debt-ridden](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-elon-musks-twitter-faces-mountain-of-debt-falling-revenue-and-surging-costs-11669042132) social media company that [not many people use](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/05/05/10-facts-about-americans-and-twitter/) and which was already in [steep decline](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-where-did-tweeters-go-twitter-is-losing-its-most-active-users-internal-2022-10-25/) before he got there. With [neo-Nazis returning](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-twitter-reinstates-neo-nazi-andrew-anglin-account-1234640390/) to the platform, [advertisers are taking their leave](https://mashable.com/article/twitter-advertisers-leaving-app-elon-musk). Musk has already [lost a tidy amount of money](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-8-billion-dollars-poorer-taking-over-twitter-2022-10) since the deal, and there isn’t a logical way for the firm’s balance sheets to ever make sense again. His big new revenue-generating idea? [Stop paying rent](https://twitter.com/aterkel/status/1602784292433760256).

这是在目睹了他收购Twitter以及此后他在Twitter上制造的粪便混乱后得出的必然结论。他花了440亿美元自己的钱来拥有自由党，但相反，随着时间的推移，看起来像是他策划了自己的骗局。他背负着一家负债累累的社交媒体公司，没有多少人使用，在他到达那里之前就已经在急剧下降。随着新纳粹分子重返这个平台，广告商们正在离开。自这笔交易以来，马斯克已经损失了相当多的钱，而且公司的资产负债表也没有一个合乎逻辑的方式可以恢复正常。他的新创收计划？停止支付租金。

But this is only the latest evidence that Musk is not the genius that the mainstream press has long made him out to be. Quite the opposite. He is best known for being the public face of a car company that he [neither founded nor provided](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2022/01/exposing-the-fraudulence-of-elon-musk-and-tesla) the seed of inspiration for. He has a company that purportedly builds tunnels that looks [more like a put-up job](https://jalopnik.com/did-musk-propose-hyperloop-to-stop-california-high-spee-1849402460) to kill high-speed rail developments. He has a space-faring concern that might regularly provide clapped-out oligarchs with the thrill of post-Laika-era orbital excursions. He wants to put [some kind of microchip](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-says-neuralink-could-help-create-superhuman-intelligence-but-the-technology-could-be-a-rare-failure-for-one-of-his-companies-11670864762) in people’s heads, an idea that, as a sci-fi convention, almost always spells disaster. This does not seem like a well-rounded portfolio or a stable master plan.

但这只是最新的证据，表明马斯克并不是主流媒体长期以来所宣扬的那种天才。恰恰相反。他最为人所知的是作为一家汽车公司的公众形象，他既没有创立也没有提供灵感的种子。他有一家公司，据称建造隧道，看起来更像是一个设置工作，以扼杀高速铁路的发展。他有一个太空旅行的担忧，可能会定期为精疲力竭的寡头提供后莱卡时代轨道旅行的刺激。他想把某种微型芯片植入人们的大脑，这个想法，作为一个科幻大会，几乎总是意味着灾难。这似乎不是一个全面的投资组合或稳定的总体规划。

Instead, Musk is what attention-deficit disorder looks like at a plutocratic scale. _The Atlantic_’s Charlie Warzel, responding to Musk’s tweet about how his “pronouns” were “prosecute/Fauci,” [got it right](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/elon-musk-twitter-far-right-activist/672436/): “Beyond its stark cruelty, this tweet is incredibly thirsty.” No one on this planet is as desperately in need of attention. He has taken that crown from Donald Trump. And like the former president, there are no depths to plumb here, no mystery to solve. Musk doesn’t contain multitudes of anything besides, perhaps, the combined personification of several [Dril tweets](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/22/dril-musk-twitter-future/).

相反，马斯克是注意力缺陷障碍在富豪级别上的样子。《大西洋月刊》的查理·沃泽尔在回应马斯克关于他的“代词”是“起诉/福奇”的推文时说得对：“除了赤裸裸的残忍，这条推文令人难以置信的饥渴。”在这个星球上没有人是如此迫切地需要关注。他从唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）手中接过了这一桂冠。就像这位前总统一样，这里没有什么深度需要挖掘，没有什么谜团需要解开。马斯克不包含任何东西，除了，也许，几个钻推文的组合人格化。

Increasingly, the attention Musk craves is that of supposedly woke-drunk lefties, whom he attempts to trigger with a degree of wit that makes Ben Shapiro look clever. Trying to prove otherwise is a fool’s errand. Writing for _The New York Times,_ in a journalistic exercise that only proved that it was possible to labor lengthily over a topic and somehow end up knowing less than you did when you began, Jeremy Peters [attempted to offer “analysis”](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/business/media/elon-musk-politics-twitter.html?) of Musk’s ideological leanings, only to ultimately conclude that they weren’t clear enough to say with any certainty that they were right-wing. Peters’s piece aged poorly in an astonishingly short period of time: A day later, Musk [tweeted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1601894132573605888) his Fauci-pronouns “joke,” leaving no doubt about his political worldview. As Warzel wrote, Musk’s political North Star was, rather obviously, pure and uncut right-wing crankery: “Whether or not he wants to admit it, Musk is actively aiding the far right’s political project. He is a right-wing activist.” 

马斯克越来越渴望得到的关注是那些被认为是喝醉了的左撇子，他试图用某种程度的机智来引发他们，让本·夏皮罗看起来很聪明。试图证明不是这样是愚蠢的差事。杰里米·彼得斯（Jeremy Peters）为《纽约时报》撰稿，这是一次新闻实践，它证明了在一个话题上花很长时间的劳动，最终可能会比你开始时知道得更少。他试图对马斯克的意识形态倾向进行“分析”，但最终得出的结论是，这些倾向不够清晰，无法肯定地说他们是右翼。彼得斯的作品在惊人的短时间内就过时了：一天后，马斯克在推特上发布了他的福奇代词“笑话”，让人对他的政治世界观毫无疑问。正如瓦泽尔所写，马斯克的政治北极星星显然是纯粹的、未经修饰的右翼偏执狂：“不管他是否愿意承认，马斯克正在积极帮助极右翼的政治项目。他是一个右翼活动家。”

Warzel never quite arrives at the answer to why Musk is the way he is. But there’s a simple explanation: Musk isn’t cultivating an ideological worldview, he’s just responding to stimulus. His commitment to right-wing ideas is entirely due to the fact that the only people who are currently providing him with the attention he craves are right-wing shitposters. Ergo, he’s a right-wing guy now, who adopts their memes and tropes and their jokes about pronouns. By and large, the only reaction he’s getting from the left is mockery.

沃泽尔从来没有完全找到马斯克为什么是现在这个样子的答案。但有一个简单的解释：马斯克不是在培养意识形态世界观，他只是在应对刺激。他对右翼思想的承诺完全是由于这样一个事实，即目前唯一能给他提供他所渴望的关注的人是右翼的狗屎海报。因此，他现在是一个右翼分子，谁采用他们的模因和比喻和他们的笑话代词。总的来说，他从左派那里得到的唯一反应是嘲笑。

As Dave Karpf has noted, you can boil down the product Musk is selling to [one commodity](https://twitter.com/davekarpf/status/1601381093370114048): [fan service](https://twitter.com/davekarpf/status/1601377500558303232). His goal is to give Elon Musk stans more of what they want, in a mutually assured orgy of “feeling seen.” If you’re willing to be Very Online and Slavishly Devoted, Musk will keep providing you the goods. And for the low price of $8 per month, you can be a primo member of his cult of personality, the benefit being that he will [rejigger the Twitter algorithm](https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-says-twitter-will-charge-8-blue-tick-2022-11-01/) to boost the true believers and leave the haters and losers out of the larger conversation. (Which, by the way, seems fine to me! I don’t know how right-wing trolls will enjoy Twitter once the people they want to persecute disappear from view.) 

正如戴夫·卡普夫所指出的，你可以把马斯克销售的产品归结为一种商品：粉丝服务。他的目标是给予埃隆·马斯克斯坦斯更多他们想要的东西，在一场相互保证的“感觉被看到”的狂欢中如果你愿意成为一个非常在线和奴隶般的奉献者，马斯克将继续为你提供商品。以每月8美元的低价，你可以成为他个人崇拜的主要成员，好处是他将重新调整Twitter算法，以提高真正的信徒，并将仇恨者和失败者排除在更大的对话之外。（顺便说一句，这对我来说似乎很好！我不知道一旦他们想要迫害的人从人们的视野中消失，右翼巨魔会如何享受Twitter。）

Perhaps no one needs an online community of toadies more than Musk does now, because his recent interactions with nonbelievers have been awkward, to say the least. When he was invited onstage at a  Dave Chappelle show, he was subjected to a [long and lingering howl of disapproval](https://newrepublic.com/post/169442/elon-musk-endlessly-booed-dave-chappelle-show) that left him sheepish and shell-shocked (and which seemed to engender no small amount of resentment from Chappelle). Days later, Musk jumped into a Twitter Space hosted by Katie Notopoulos to explain why he’d suspended the accounts of several journalists. He fled the scene after experiencing mild pushback and apparently then disconnected Notopoulos’s ability to continue hosting the chat.

也许没有人比马斯克现在更需要一个马屁精的在线社区，因为至少可以说，他最近与非信徒的互动一直很尴尬。当他被邀请到戴夫·查佩尔的一场演出的舞台上时，他遭到了一声长长的、挥之不去的不赞成的嚎叫，这让他感到羞怯和震惊（这似乎引起了查佩尔的不小的怨恨）。几天后，马斯克跳进了凯蒂·诺托普洛斯主持的Twitter空间，解释他为什么暂停了几名记者的账户。他在经历了轻微的反击后逃离了现场，显然随后切断了Notopoulos继续主持聊天的能力。

There’s a certain social desperation underlying all of this—his wavering and reckless acquisition of Twitter, his reinstatement of far-right scum, his banishment of journalists who don’t give him the wrong kind of attention he craves. Musk is creating his safe space: an alternate universe where those [boos were barely noticeable, actually](https://www.discourseblog.com/p/the-humiliation-of-elon-musk-is-a), and his jokes are always funny. Turning Twitter into a hermetically sealed chamber of constant Elon adulation is the only bona fide vision Musk has ever had as a businessman. Given the site’s rapid deterioration under his watch, we can only hope that one day it will be reduced to the minimum lines of code necessary for a sad uber-billionaire to live rent-free in his own head forever.

所有这一切背后都有某种社会绝望a-他对Twitter的动摇和鲁莽收购，他对极右翼人渣的复职，他对那些没有给予他所渴望的错误关注的记者的驱逐。马斯克正在创造他的安全空间：在另一个宇宙里，那些Boos几乎不引人注意，实际上，他的笑话总是很有趣。把推特变成一个密封的房间，不断对埃隆阿谀奉承，这是马斯克作为一个商人所拥有的唯一真正的愿景。考虑到网站在他的监管下迅速恶化，我们只能希望有一天它能减少到一个可悲的超级亿万富翁永远免费生活在自己头脑中所需的最少代码行。
