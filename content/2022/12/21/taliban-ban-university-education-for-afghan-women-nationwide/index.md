Afghanistan's Taliban rulers on Tuesday banned university education for females nationwide, as the hardline Islamists continue to crush women's right to education and freedom.

阿富汗塔利班统治者周二禁止全国范围内的女性接受大学教育，因为强硬的伊斯兰主义者继续压制女性的受教育权和自由权。

Despite promising a softer rule when they [seized power](https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20210815-live-taliban-enter-outskirts-of-kabul-as-us-evacuates-embassy) last year, the [Taliban](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/taliban/) have ratcheted up restrictions on all aspects of [women](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/women/)'s lives, ignoring international outrage.

尽管塔利班在去年夺权时承诺实行更温和的统治，但塔利班无视国际社会的愤怒，加大了对妇女生活各个方面的限制。

"You all are informed to immediately implement the mentioned order of suspending education of females until further notice," said a letter issued to all government and private universities, signed by the Minister for Higher Education, Neda Mohammad Nadeem.

高等教育部长内达·穆罕默德·纳迪姆 (Neda Mohammad Nadeem) 签署了一封发给所有政府和私立大学的信，称：“你们都被告知立即执行上述暂停女性教育的命令，直至另行通知。”

The spokesman for the ministry, Ziaullah Hashimi, who tweeted the letter, confirmed the order in a text message to AFP.

在推特上发布这封信的该部发言人 Ziaullah Hashimi 在发给法新社的短信中证实了这一命令。

Washington condemned the decision "in the strongest terms."  
华盛顿“以最强烈的措辞”谴责了这一决定。

"The Taliban should expect that this decision, which is in contravention to the commitments they have made repeatedly and publicly to their own people, will carry concrete costs for them," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters in Washington.

美国国务院发言人内德·普莱斯在华盛顿对记者说：“塔利班应该预料到，这一决定违背了他们一再公开向本国人民作出的承诺，将为他们带来具体的代价。”

The ban on higher education comes less than three months after thousands of girls and women sat university entrance exams across the country, with many aspiring to choose teaching and medicine as future careers.

在全国成千上万的女孩和妇女参加大学入学考试后不到三个月，高等教育禁令就出台了，其中许多人渴望选择教学和医学作为未来的职业。

The universities are currently on winter break and due to reopen in March.

这些大学目前正在放寒假，并将于 3 月重新开放。

After the takeover of the country by the Taliban, universities were forced to implement new rules including gender segregated classrooms and entrances, while women were only permitted to be taught by women professors or old men.

塔利班接管该国后，大学被迫实施新规定，包括性别隔离的教室和入口，而女性只能由女教授或老年男性授课。

Most teenage girls across the country have already been banned from secondary school education, severely limiting university intake.

全国大多数少女已经被禁止接受中学教育，严重限制了大学入学率。

Journalism student Madina, who wanted only her first name published, struggled to comprehend the weight of Tuesday's order.

新闻专业的学生麦迪娜只想公开自己的名字，她很难理解周二命令的重要性。

"I have nothing to say. Not only me but all my friends have no words to express our feelings," the 18-year-old told AFP in Kabul.

“我无话可说。不仅是我，我所有的朋友都无法表达我们的感受，”这位 18 岁的年轻人在喀布尔告诉法新社。

"Everyone is thinking about the unknown future ahead of them. They buried our dreams."

“每个人都在想着他们面前未知的未来。他们埋葬了我们的梦想。”

The country was returning to "dark days", added medicine student Rhea in the capital, who asked that her name be changed.

这个国家正在回到“黑暗的日子”，首都的医学生 Rhea 补充说，她要求更改她的名字。

"When we were hoping to make progress, they are removing us from the society," the 26-year-old said.

“当我们希望取得进步时，他们正在将我们从社会中移除，”这位 26 岁的年轻人说。

## 'A fundamental human right'

“一项基本人权”

The United Nations is "deeply concerned" by the order, said Ramiz Alakbarov, UN chief's deputy special representative for Afghanistan.

联合国负责阿富汗事务的副特别代表拉米兹·阿拉克巴罗夫 (Ramiz Alakbarov) 表示，联合国对该命令“深表关切”。

"Education is a fundamental human right. A door closed to women's education is a door closed to the future of Afghanistan," he tweeted.

“教育是一项基本人权。对女性教育关闭的大门就是对阿富汗未来关闭的大门，”他在推特上写道。

The Taliban adheres to an austere version of Islam, with the movement's supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada and his inner circle of Afghan clerics against modern education, especially for girls and women.

塔利班信奉严格的伊斯兰教，该运动的最高领袖希巴图拉·阿洪扎达 (Hibatullah Akhundzada) 和他的阿富汗神职人员核心圈子反对现代教育，尤其是针对女孩和妇女的教育。

But they are at odds with many officials in Kabul and among their rank and file who had hoped girls would be allowed to continue learning following the takeover.

但他们与喀布尔的许多官员和他们的普通官员意见相左，后者曾希望在接管后允许女孩继续学习。

"There are serious differences in the Taliban ranks on girls' education and the latest decision will increase these differences," a Taliban commander based in northwest Pakistan told AFP on condition of anonymity.

一名驻扎在巴基斯坦西北部的塔利班指挥官在不愿透露姓名的情况下告诉法新社：“塔利班在女孩教育问题上存在严重分歧，而最新的决定将加剧这些分歧。”

In a cruel U-turn, the Taliban in March blocked girls from returning to secondary schools on the morning they were supposed to reopen.

塔利班在 3 月份进行了一次残酷的大转弯，阻止女孩在本应重新开学的早上返回中学。

Several Taliban officials say the secondary education ban is only temporary, but they have also wheeled out a litany of excuses for the closure -- from a lack of funds to time needed to remodel the syllabus along Islamic lines.

几名塔利班官员表示，中学教育禁令只是暂时的，但他们也为关闭学校找了一连串的借口——从缺乏资金到需要时间按照伊斯兰教路线改造教学大纲。

Since the ban, many teenage girls have been married off early -- often to much older men of their father's choice.

自禁令实施以来，许多十几岁的女孩早早就嫁给了她们父亲选择的年长得多的男人。

Several families interviewed by AFP last month said that coupled with economic pressure the school ban meant that securing their daughters' future through marriage was better than them sitting idle at home.

上个月接受法新社采访的几个家庭表示，加上经济压力，学校禁令意味着通过婚姻来确保女儿的未来比让她们闲在家里更好。

## International pressure

国际压力

Women have also been pushed out of many government jobs -- or are being paid a slashed salary to stay at home. They are also barred from travelling without a male relative, and must cover up outside of the home, ideally with a burqa.

女性也被赶出许多政府工作岗位——或者被削减工资以留在家中。她们也被禁止在没有男性亲属的情况下旅行，并且必须在家外遮盖起来，最好是穿罩袍。

In November they were also prohibited from going to parks, funfairs, gyms and public baths.

11 月，他们还被禁止去公园、游乐场、健身房和公共浴室。

The international community has made the right to education for all women a sticking point in negotiations over aid and recognition of the Taliban regime.

国际社会将所有妇女的受教育权作为援助和承认塔利班政权谈判的症结所在。

"The international community has not and will not forget Afghan women and girls," the UN Security Council said in a statement in September.

“国际社会没有也不会忘记阿富汗妇女和女童，”联合国安理会在 9 月的一份声明中说。

In the 20 years between the Taliban's two reigns, girls were allowed to go to school and women were able to seek employment in all sectors, though the country remained socially conservative.

在塔利班两次统治之间的 20 年里，女孩被允许上学，妇女能够在各个部门寻找工作，尽管该国仍然在社会上保持保守。

The authorities have also returned to public floggings and executions of men and women in recent weeks as they implement an extreme interpretation of Islamic sharia law.

最近几周，当局还恢复了对男性和女性的公开鞭刑和处决，因为他们实施了对伊斯兰教法的极端解释。

An economic crisis in Afghanistan has only worsened since the Taliban returned to power following the hasty withdrawal of US-led foreign forces last August.

自去年 8 月以美国为首的外国军队仓促撤离后塔利班重新掌权以来，阿富汗的经济危机更加恶化。

Washington froze $7 billion of Afghanistan's assets held in the United States while billions in foreign aid that helped prop up the country has vastly reduced.

华盛顿冻结了阿富汗在美国持有的 70 亿美元资产，而帮助支撑该国的数十亿美元外国援助已大幅减少。
