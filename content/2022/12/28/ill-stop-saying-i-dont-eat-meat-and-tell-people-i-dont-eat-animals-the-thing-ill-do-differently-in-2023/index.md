I don’t think I’ve ever made a new year resolution. But this year I’m going to stop telling people that I don’t eat meat. It’s not that I do eat meat – I don’t. The thing is, when I tell people that I don’t eat meat, I’m saying it to be polite. I use that form of words because I don’t want to offend people. So, from now on I’m going to be more honest. I’m just going to tell people that I don’t eat animals.

我想我从来没有制定过新年计划。但今年我将不再告诉人们我不吃肉。并不是说我吃肉——我不吃。问题是，当我告诉别人我不吃肉时，我是出于礼貌。我使用那种形式的词是因为我不想冒犯别人。所以，从现在开始，我要更加诚实。我只是想告诉人们我不吃动物。

I was nine when I decided to stop eating animals. My twin sister and I were the only black children in school. I experienced racism in and out of the classroom, so in the playground I would often find myself sitting in a corner talking to the local cats. When the cats were away, I’d talk to the birds and the bees. Amazingly, I never met a racist animal. Some were nervous when they first approached me, some would make a few visits before they got close, but it never took long for us to make a connection. Then we would just hang out together.

当我决定停止吃动物时，我才九岁。我和我的双胞胎姐姐是学校里唯一的黑人孩子。我在教室内外都经历过种族歧视，所以在操场上，我经常发现自己坐在角落里和当地的猫聊天。当猫不在时，我会与鸟儿和蜜蜂交谈。令人惊讶的是，我从未遇到过种族主义动物。有些人第一次来找我时很紧张，有些人会在亲近之前拜访几次，但我们很快就建立了联系。然后我们就一起出去玩。

Even though I wanted to stop eating animals then, I was “force-fed” bits (which I ate very reluctantly) until I was 11 and turned [vegetarian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/vegetarianism). That’s when I felt I could put my foot down and express myself. My mother thought it was just a phase I was going through, until [I turned vegan at 13](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/veganism), and I’ve never looked back since. So I really don’t remember what meat tastes like.

尽管那时我想停止吃动物，但直到我 11 岁成为素食主义者之前，我还是被“强制喂食”（我非常不情愿地吃了）。那时我觉得我可以放下脚来表达自己。我的母亲认为这只是我正在经历的一个阶段，直到我在 13 岁成为素食主义者，从那以后我再也没有回头。所以我真的不记得肉是什么味道了。

Meat itself is not my main concern. I think going vegan for health reasons is great. There are also valid and urgent environmental reasons for going vegan. A plant-based diet can reduce those dreaded emissions by [up to 70%](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/news/201603-plant-based-diets/), and that’s not just greenhouse emissions. I’m talking about other baddies, like those horrible acidifying and [eutrophying emissions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/31/eutrophication-algae-how-animal-waste-is-turning-chinas-lakes-green) that we get from intensive farming practices. Worldwide more and more people are becoming vegan, and if everyone decided to adopt a plant-based diet we could save about [75% of the world’s farmland](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth).

肉本身不是我主要关心的问题。我认为出于健康原因而成为素食主义者很棒。成为素食主义者也有正当且紧迫的环境原因。以植物为主的饮食可以将这些可怕的排放量减少高达 70%，而这不仅仅是温室气体排放量。我说的是其他坏事，比如我们从集约化耕作中得到的那些可怕的酸化和富营养化排放物。全世界越来越多的人成为素食主义者，如果每个人都决定采用植物性饮食，我们可以拯救世界上大约 75% 的农田。

But for me, it is simpler than that. I’m vegan because I love animals. I feel I’m not telling the whole story when I say I don’t eat meat. I do have issues with the smell of it. This might be because of personal trauma. One night, in the late 80s, I was walking through Beirut, which was then said to be the most dangerous city in the world, when I came across a pile of burning bodies. I will never forget the stench. Now, every time I smell animals being cooked I have flashbacks to that terrifying night.

但对我来说，它比那更简单。我是素食主义者，因为我喜欢动物。当我说我不吃肉时，我觉得我没有讲完整的故事。我确实对它的气味有意见。这可能是因为个人创伤。 80 年代后期的一天晚上，我在贝鲁特——当时被称为世界上最危险的城市——行走时，遇到了一堆燃烧的尸体。我永远不会忘记恶臭。现在，每当我闻到动物被煮熟的味道时，我都会想起那个可怕的夜晚。

When I stopped eating animals I told my mother that I don’t eat my friends. When I grew up, someone told me that George Bernard Shaw had said that a long time before me. A wise woman once said: “I don’t eat anything with a face on it,” and a Jamaican friend of mine recently said: “I don’t eat anything with an arse.” I really don’t want to offend animal eaters for the sake of it. I just want to be more honest about the way I use words. I am not a pet lover. I’m an animal lover. I don’t single out certain animals that I think are cute and lovely so that I can stroke them as I watch TV on the couch.

当我停止吃动物时，我告诉妈妈我不吃我的朋友。当我长大后，有人告诉我，萧伯纳在我很久之前就说过这句话。一位聪明的女人曾经说过：“我不吃有脸的东西，”我的一位牙买加朋友最近说：“我不吃有屁股的东西。”我真的不想因此而得罪食动物者。我只是想更诚实地表达我使用文字的方式。我不是宠物爱好者。我是一个动物爱好者。我不会挑出某些我认为可爱的动物，这样我就可以在沙发上看电视时抚摸它们。

I don’t even really have a favourite animal. I just don’t think animals are here for my entertainment, or to make me feel better. When I look into the eyes of an animal, I not only see into its soul, I also see a sentient being that might have similar concerns to me. Like the need for food, shelter, and comfort, not to mention love. So even if the meat industry had zero impact on the environment, and my health was guaranteed regardless of what I ate, I still could not eat animals.

我什至没有真正喜欢的动物。我只是不认为动物来这里是为了我的娱乐，或者让我感觉更好。当我看着一只动物的眼睛时，我不仅看到了它的灵魂，还看到了一个可能与我有类似担忧的众生。就像对食物、住所和舒适的需要，更不用说爱情了。所以即使肉类行业对环境的影响为零，无论我吃什么都保证我的健康，我仍然不能吃动物。

I once decided that I would never ask people if they were OK, unless I really meant it, and I was prepared to listen and help if they weren’t. A long time ago, I decided never to tell people to stay in touch if I didn’t really mean it. I won’t even tell people that it’s good to see them, if I don’t mean it. I just want my interactions with people to be genuine. I don’t really know anything about meat. I don’t lie in bed at night thinking about meat. So, from next year onwards I’m going to tell people the truth. I don’t eat animals. But I won’t be telling you, because now you know.

我曾经决定永远不会问别人他们是否还好，除非我真的是认真的，如果他们不是，我准备好倾听和帮助。很久以前，我决定如果我不是真心的话，永远不要告诉人们保持联系。如果我不是这个意思，我什至不会告诉人们很高兴见到他们。我只希望我与人的互动是真诚的。我对肉一无所知。我不会晚上躺在床上想着肉。所以，从明年开始，我要告诉人们真相。我不吃动物。但我不会告诉你，因为现在你知道了。
