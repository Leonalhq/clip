ChatGPT-maker OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has said that employees working from office can create new products while remote work model creates confusion. At a session organized by fintech company, Stripe, he further added that we still don’t have the technology that is needed for people to go fully remote, as reported by India Today Tech.  

聊天工具制造商OpenAI的首席执行官Sam Altman表示，在办公室工作的员工可以创造新的产品，而远程工作模式会造成混乱。在金融科技公司Stripe组织的一次会议上，他进一步补充说，我们仍然没有人们完全远程工作所需的技术，据《今日印度科技》报道。

Talking about work from home, Altman added that he considers remote work as an experiment. He stated, "I think definitely one of tech industry's worst mistakes in a long time was that everybody (thought they) could go full remote forever, and startups didn't need to be together. There was going to be no loss of creativity. I would say that the experiment on that is over, and the technology is not yet good enough that people can be full remote forever, particularly on startups."  

谈到在家工作，奥特曼补充说，他认为远程工作是一种尝试。他说："我认为在很长一段时间内，科技行业最糟糕的错误之一是，每个人（认为他们）可以永远完全远程工作，而创业公司不需要在一起。不会有创造力的损失。我想说的是，这方面的实验已经结束了，技术还没有好到人们可以永远完全远程，特别是在初创企业。"

Prior to this, Altman has expressed his inclination towards working from office. As per his tweet, “tech companies who rushed to full remote permanently made a big mistake, and the cracks are starting to show.” He further added that OpenAI’s some of the best talents are working remotely. He said, "some of our best people are remote, and we will continue to support it always, so please don't let hating SF stop you from applying to OpenAI! I don't like the open air fentanyl markets either.”  

在此之前，奥特曼曾表示他倾向于在办公室工作。按照他的推文，"急于全面远程永久的科技公司犯了一个大错误，裂痕开始显现"。他进一步补充说，OpenAI的一些最优秀的人才正在远程工作。他说，"我们最好的一些人是远程工作，我们将继续一直支持，所以请不要让讨厌SF的人阻止你申请OpenAI!我也不喜欢露天的芬太尼市场"。

Discussing about the importance of working from office for a startup, Altman noted, “The more unclear and early the product is, the more in-person time the team needs to grind together," he added.  

在讨论办公室工作对初创企业的重要性时，奥特曼指出："产品越是不明确，越是早期，团队需要磨合的当面时间就越多，"他补充说。

Altman also spoke about the future of AI. According to Altman, AI needs to be treated with “extreme seriousness” as the tech might have “existential risk” attached to it.     

奥特曼还谈到了人工智能的未来。根据奥特曼的说法，需要以 "极端严肃的态度 "对待人工智能，因为这项技术可能会有 "生存风险 "附加在上面。
