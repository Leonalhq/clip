### Chapter Text 章节正文

Time had still flowed oddly on the first creative day, what with gravity still a work in progress. The veil between Heaven and the physical universe had been thinner, too, the barest of gossamer. The spellwork that would later be needed to punch through to communicate between Heaven and the physical realm or even between two spirit beings hadn’t been necessary, then. The seconds stretched on for centuries as angels spun the raw power from the big bang into planetary bodies.  
时间在第一个创造的日子里仍然奇怪地流动着，重力仍然在进展中。天堂和物质宇宙之间的面纱也更薄，只有最薄的薄纱。那时候，还不需要后来用于在天堂和物质界之间或者两个灵魂之间进行沟通的咒语。秒钟变成了世纪，天使们将大爆炸中的原始力量转化为行星。

Gabriel watched his team carefully, dictating spin and mass and planetary order. He gave approbation when it was appropriate, criticism when needed (usually in written form, easier to take that way). His team was crisp and disciplined, working in dutiful silence.  
加布里埃尔仔细观察着他的团队，指导着旋转、质量和行星的排列。当情况合适时，他给予赞许，当需要时则提出批评（通常以书面形式，这样更容易接受）。他的团队整齐而有纪律，默默地工作着。

Raphael’s team-- well, the less said about Raphael’s team the better. They carried on pointless conversations with each other. Raphael carried on pointless conversations with them. They painted nebulas in whatever shapes and colors suited their individual fancies, with no uniformity or pattern at all. They made pulsars that flashed out rude messages in some made-up language. Worse, they didn’t even keep to themselves. Gabriel had had to discipline his own team sharply on several occasions for unnecessary conversation with members of Raphael’s group. Aziraphale most of all. Gabriel had finally had to assign him to asteroid duty on the far end of the active sector just to keep him quiet and on task.  
拉斐尔的团队——嗯，越少提拉斐尔的团队越好。他们之间进行毫无意义的对话。拉斐尔也和他们进行毫无意义的对话。他们随心所欲地绘制星云，形状和颜色各异，毫无统一性或规律可言。他们还制作了闪烁着粗鲁信息的脉冲星，用一种虚构的语言。更糟糕的是，他们甚至不守规矩。加百列曾多次严厉惩罚自己的团队与拉斐尔的团队成员进行不必要的交谈。尤其是阿齐拉费尔。加百列最终不得不将他分配到活跃区域的远端从事小行星任务，以保持他安静并专注于任务。

“Your team needs more supervision,” Gabriel told Raphael for what felt like the hundredth time.  
“你的团队需要更多的监督。”加布里埃尔像是第一百次一样对拉斐尔说道。

“My team is fine,” Raphael said, not looking up from the nebula he was working on instead of supervising his clucking flock. “More creation per photon-interval than yours by 3%, or so Metatron tells me.”  
“我的团队还好。”拉斐尔说道，他没有抬头看着他正在处理的星云，而不是监督他那些咯咯叫的群体。“根据梅塔特隆告诉我的，每个光子间隔的创造力比你们多3%。”

That was the part that rankled most of all.  
那是最让人恼火的部分。

_“Gabriel? Ah, sir?”_ the prayer sounded at the same time Raphael spoke, even though only Gabriel could hear it. Aziraphale, the chatterbox.  
“加百列？啊，先生？” 拉斐尔说话的同时，祈祷声响起，尽管只有加百列能听到。阿齐拉费尔，那个喋喋不休的家伙。

Gabriel ignored Aziraphale in favor of responding to Raphael.  
加百列无视了亚齐拉费尔，选择回应拉斐尔。

“Well, _I_ don’t do my people’s work for them instead of supervising.”  
“嗯，我不会替我的员工做他们的工作，而是监督他们。”

“My people know what they’re doing and to come get me if there’s a problem. They don’t need me hovering over them every second,” Raphael said, as if just talking to Gabriel was making him tired. “As fun as it is chatting about how upset you are that my methods get better results, I’m in the middle of something. Go… bring joy to someone else.” His words were polite, but his tone of voice was dismissive. Raphael’s habit of double-talk was yet another item on the list of things wrong with Raphael.  
“如果有问题，我的团队知道该怎么做，并且会来找我。他们不需要我每时每刻都盯着他们。”拉斐尔说着，仿佛与加百列交谈让他感到疲倦。“虽然聊聊你对我的方法取得更好成果感到不满很有趣，但我现在正忙着做其他事情。去...给别人带来快乐吧。”他的措辞很客气，但语气中透着一种不屑。拉斐尔喜欢说一套做一套，这只是他种种问题中的又一项。

It dawned on Gabriel that Raphael’s hair was tied back, and his robes were girded tightly to his body.  
加百列突然意识到拉斐尔的头发被束起来，他的长袍紧紧地束在身上。

_“Sir, I know this is probably a bad time--”_ Aziraphale prayed again. Gabriel silenced the prayer and backed up from Raphael’s project. Building a nebula didn’t require precautions, but transitioning one into a black hole did.  
“先生，我知道现在可能不是个好时机——”亚齐拉费尔再次祈祷。加百列打断了祈祷，从拉斐尔的项目中退了出来。建造一个星云不需要预防措施，但将其转变为黑洞则需要。

“You shouldn’t be doing that,” Gabriel scolded.  
“你不应该这样做。”加布里埃尔责备道。

Raphael finally looked up, fixing Gabriel with a hard stare. His eyes were purple, like Gabriel’s, but that was where the resemblance ended. Raphael had the ugliest corporation Gabriel had ever seen: pointed face, spindly appendages. Even his patterning was wrong. Every other angel with patterning had mottling, perhaps colored lips. Raphael’s corporation had a faint gold squiggle in front of each ear.  
拉斐尔终于抬起头，用坚定的目光盯着加百列。他的眼睛是紫色的，就像加百列的眼睛一样，但相似之处就到此为止了。拉斐尔是加百列见过的最丑陋的天使：尖尖的脸，细长的四肢。甚至他的图案也是错误的。其他有图案的天使都有斑点，也许还有着色的嘴唇。而拉斐尔的身体前面每个耳朵都有一个淡淡的金色卷曲图案。

“So I should just send one of the lads, and if he goes the way of Mariel, well, there are plenty in the Third Choir, what’s one gone?” Raphael asked. The question was clearly rhetorical.  
“那我就派一个小伙子去，如果他像马里尔那样，那也没关系，第三合唱团里还有很多人，一个走了又有什么？”拉斐尔问道。这个问题显然是个修辞问题。

Mariel had been the one to discover that even a standard black hole’s singularity was powerful enough to affect an angel. He had never been seen again, in Heaven or the Universe. Had he been torn apart? Crushed? Sent to another dimension? Or was he simply motionless, unable to pull himself free, like the photons on the event horizon? No one knew, and God wasn’t telling.  
玛丽尔是第一个发现即使是标准黑洞的奇点也足以影响天使的人。他再也没有在天堂或宇宙中被看到过。他是被撕裂了吗？被压碎了吗？被送到另一个维度了吗？还是他只是静止不动，无法摆脱像事件视界上的光子一样？没有人知道，上帝也没有透露。

Raphael snapped his fingers, one hand below and above the nebula. All molecular movement stopped.  
拉斐尔咔嗒一声，一只手在星云下方，一只手在上方。所有分子运动停止了。

“I’m a lot less likely to have a problem than they are.”  
我遇到问题的可能性比他们小得多。

“Excuse me, Gabriel, sir?” This time the interruption wasn’t Aziraphale, but one of Raphael’s.  
“不好意思，加百列先生？” 这次打断的不是亚齐拉费尔，而是拉斐尔之一。

“Can you not see we’re talking?” Gabriel demanded sharply. Undisciplined, disorderly, disrespectful – exactly like her commander.  
“你看不见我们在谈话吗？”加布里埃尔尖锐地要求道。不守纪律、无秩序、不尊重——就像她的指挥官一样。

“Well, sir, one of yours-- I think he’s been calling for you.” The angel’s hands were folded decorously, but her even voice made the entire sentence reek of unrepentance.  
“嗯，先生，您的其中一位——我想他一直在找您。”天使的手端庄地叠放在一起，但她平静的声音让整个句子散发出无悔的气息。

“And I’m busy,” Gabriel said over-patiently.  
“我很忙，”加布里埃尔耐心地说道。

Raphael had the audacity to roll his eyes.  
拉斐尔竟然翻了翻白眼。

“What’s the problem, Khizir?” Raphael asked his subordinate.  
“有什么问题，Khizir？”拉斐尔问他的下属。

“There was a-- a storm, I guess you could call it. The star he was hanging asteroids on plowed right through it. I’ve never seen anyone’s wings look like that, Raf. What should I do?”  
“有一场——一场风暴，我想你可以这么说。他挂在星球上的小行星直接穿过了它。我从来没有见过有人的翅膀看起来像那样，Raf。我该怎么办？”

Aziraphale, it had to be.  
亚齐拉费尔，非他不可。

“_Raphael,_” Gabriel corrected the junior angel, since her superior clearly wasn’t going to. “Aziraphale is an angel of the Lord. Matter isn’t going to do him any lasting harm.” Gabriel made it clear with his tone of voice that he was stating the obvious.  
“拉斐尔，”加百列纠正了这位初级天使，因为她的上级显然不会这么做。“阿齐拉费尔是上帝的天使。物质不会对他造成任何持久的伤害。”加百列用语气明确地表达了他在陈述显而易见的事实。

_“I’ll find someone else for asteroid duty, don’t worry,”_ Gabriel shot back along the channel to Aziraphale. _“We’ll give you something else to do when you return to Heaven.”_  
“别担心，我会找别人来负责小行星的任务。”加百列通过频道回应阿齐拉费尔。“当你回到天堂时，我们会给你其他的事情做。”

“I’ll take care of it,” Raphael said, nodding for Khizir to be on her way. He snapped his fingers to start molecular motion, and then waived the nebula apart.  
“我会处理好的。”拉斐尔点点头，示意赫齐尔可以走了。他弹了弹手指，开始分子运动，然后挥手将星云分开。

“You are not ruining my department like you’ve ruined yours,” Gabriel ordered. “Stay out of it.”  
“你不要像你毁了你的部门一样毁了我的部门。”加布里埃尔命令道。“别管这事。”

“I don’t take orders from you,” Raphael said, hands held out to either side. He disappeared.  
“我不听你的命令。”拉斐尔双手伸向两侧说道。他消失了。

Aziraphale’s assignment had been asteroid belts. Boring rings of boring rocks as far as the ranking angels were concerned, but like the gas giants, they would provide valuable protection from inter-planetary debris for the life-sustaining inner planets. He had been so engrossed in optimizing placement and speed for maximum efficiency that he hadn’t noticed the gout of – something – until the star he’d been hanging asteroids around had plowed right through it.  
亚齐拉费尔的任务是处理小行星带。对于排名较高的天使们来说，这些无聊的岩石环带毫无吸引力，但就像气态巨星一样，它们为内部的宜居行星提供了宝贵的防护，避免了星际碎片的侵袭。他一直专注于优化位置和速度，以实现最大效率，以至于没有注意到那股-某种-喷发，直到他所环绕的那颗恒星穿过它。

All Aziraphale really remembered of the impact was drawing his wings up to protect himself at the last second, his vision whiting out, and searing, unimaginable agony.  
阿齐拉费尔真正记得的撞击只有在最后一刻收起翅膀保护自己，视线变得模糊，烈焰般的难以想象的痛苦。

When his vision returned, spotty and full of phantom orbs, Aziraphale was laying on one of his asteroids. The asteroid had been blown free of the star. Aziraphale hadn’t known how long he’d been blinded, only that it was long enough for the main hub of celestial activity to have receded considerably behind him.  
当他的视力恢复时，布满幻影球的斑点，亚齐拉费尔躺在他的一个小行星上。这颗小行星已经从星球上脱离出来。亚齐拉费尔不知道自己失明了多久，只知道足够长的时间让天上的主要活动中心在他身后大大减少了。

The pain had barely faded at all.  
痛苦几乎没有消退。

Aziraphale rolled over, barely suppressing crying out. It felt like his musculature was tearing free of his back, with sharper knives scraping between his wing bones. He looked down. His white robe was covered with black ash and-- silvery frozen ichor. The only thing holding it up was ragged threads and dried ichor caking the garment to his skin.  
亚齐拉费尔翻了个身，勉强忍住了呻吟。感觉他的肌肉仿佛要从背部撕裂开来，尖锐的刀刃在翅骨之间刮擦。他低头看去，他的白袍上布满了黑色的灰烬，还有银色的冻结粘液。唯一支撑着它的是破烂的线缝和干涸的粘液将衣物粘在他的皮肤上。

He could do this. He could. He had to see how bad the damage was.  
他可以做到这一点。他可以的。他必须看看损坏有多严重。

Aziraphale craned his neck, first to the left then to the right, which pulled at his ravaged shoulders. What he saw was a much bigger problem.  
亚齐拉费尔扭动着脖子，先向左再向右，这让他受伤的肩膀更加疼痛。他看到的是一个更大的问题。

Both wings were burnt, missing the charred feathers that had smeared on his robes and the asteroid’s surface. The right wing’s elbow joint was bent at an unnatural angle. Aziraphale tried to raise it. While the humerus would move, the rest of his wing was a useless mass of feathers and flesh. Looking at it made Aziraphale feel light-headed, almost faded, so he looked away.  
两只翅膀都被烧焦了，烧焦的羽毛沾满了他的长袍和小行星的表面。右翅的肘关节弯曲得不自然。亚齐拉费尔试图抬起它。虽然肱骨可以动，但他的翅膀其他部分却成了一团无用的羽毛和肉。看着它让亚齐拉费尔感到头晕，几乎虚弱无力，所以他把目光移开了。

Flying back to the rest of the field angels was out of the question as much as getting back to Heaven.  
回到其他领域的天使们身边是不可能的，就像回到天堂一样。

He was trapped. Aziraphale closed his eyes, giving himself a moment of fear and doubt, before trying to focus his thoughts enough for prayer. It took four tries – or maybe five, Aziraphale wasn’t certain -- but finally Heaven responded.  
他被困住了。阿齐拉费尔闭上眼睛，给自己一刻恐惧和怀疑的时间，然后努力集中思绪进行祈祷。他试了四次，或者也许是五次，阿齐拉费尔不确定，但终于天堂回应了。

“I’ll find someone else for asteroid duty, don’t worry,” Gabriel said crisply. “We’ll give you something else to do when you return to Heaven.”  
“别担心，我会找别人来负责小行星的任务。”加百列干脆利落地说道。“当你回到天堂时，我们会给你其他的工作。”

That had been that, with the stars becoming less dense with every passing minute.  
那就是这样了，星星在每一分钟都变得越来越稀疏。

Aziraphale bit his lip between his teeth. He had to fix the joint. It would take a long time for his wings to heal this far from Heaven, but if that joint didn’t spring back to a proper angle on its own...  
亚齐拉费尔咬住嘴唇。他必须修复这个关节。在远离天堂的地方，他的翅膀需要很长时间才能恢复，但如果这个关节不能自行恢复到正确的角度...

Aziraphale had no idea what would happen. He was the first angel he knew of who’d ever broken a wing, but the outcome didn’t seem like it would be a Good Thing.  
亚齐拉费尔完全不知道会发生什么。他是他所知道的第一个摔断翅膀的天使，但结果似乎不会是一件好事。

He tried twice. The third try he almost made it, the bones crunching and gliding together. He couldn’t have stopped himself from screaming even if God Herself had commanded it.  
他尝试了两次。第三次他几乎成功了，骨头嘎吱作响，相互滑动。即使上帝亲自命令，他也无法阻止自己尖叫出声。

“Hey, hey, easy.”  嘿，嘿，轻松点。

It was the most beautiful voice he had ever heard, and not only for being the most welcome.  
那是他曾经听过的最美妙的声音，不仅仅因为它是最受欢迎的。

Aziraphale looked up and realized he was actually in more trouble rather than less. The speaker had gold-feathered wings: an archangel.  
亚齐拉费尔抬头一看，意识到自己实际上陷入了更大的麻烦中。说话的人拥有金色羽翼：一个大天使。

“Sir,” Aziraphale stammered. He tried to push himself up to stand properly. He promptly dropped back to his hands and knees, the light-headed and faded feeling returning in force. His robes were too stained to be presentable anyway.  
“先生，”阿齐拉费尔结结巴巴地说道。他试图站起来，但很快又跌回了双手和双膝，头晕目眩的感觉再次涌上心头。他的长袍已经太脏了，无法再展示出体面的样子。

“Heaven’s sake, just stay down.” The archangel crossed the distance and rested a hand on Aziraphale’s shoulder as if to physically prevent him from trying to stand again. (Which was entirely unnecessary, under no circumstances would Aziraphale be trying that again.) The archangel let out a long, low whistle as he stepped behind the principality.  
"老天爷，就别再站起来了。”大天使迈过距离，把手放在亚齐拉费尔的肩膀上，仿佛要亲自阻止他再次站起来。（这完全是多余的，亚齐拉费尔绝对不会再试一次。）大天使在身后发出一声长而低沉的口哨声。

“I, uh.” Aziraphale’s voice strained and thin, catching oddly on his words. “There was a-- a blast of some form, and it’s well, it’s rather, ah. Well. I apologize for my appearance.”  
“嗯，呃。”亚齐拉费尔的声音紧张而细弱，奇怪地卡在他的话语上。“有一股，一股爆炸的力量，嗯，嗯，实际上，呃。嗯。对不起，我现在的样子。”

“You’re not going to be able to fly back to Heaven like this.”  
“你这样是飞不回天堂的。”

Aziraphale hissed when the archangel’s fingers brushed his battered, though not broken, left wing. “I was told to wait, sir, until they healed.”  
当大天使的手指轻触他受伤但并未折断的左翼时，阿齐拉费尔嘶声道：“先生，我被告知要等到它们痊愈。”

“Enough with the ‘sirs.’ Raf is fine.”  
别再叫我“先生”了，直接叫我Raf就行。

Only one of the four archangels had a name close to “Raf.” Raphael’s team was in charge of inter-stellar bodies. Aziraphale’s asteroid had clearly drifted into the extra-solar void. Raphael must have come to investigate when he’d heard Aziraphale’s scream.  
四位大天使中只有一位名字与“Raf”相近，那就是拉斐尔。他的团队负责星际物体的管理。阿齐拉费尔的小行星显然已经漂移到了星际虚空中。当阿齐拉费尔发出尖叫声时，拉斐尔一定是前来调查的。

“It’s hardly appropriate for me to address you so familiarly--” Aziraphale began.  
“我这样亲昵地称呼你，似乎不太合适——”亚齐拉费尔开始说道。

“It’s hardly appropriate for a principality to be lecturing an archangel about decorum, isn’t it?” Raphael’s voice carried more than a touch of asperity, and he had Aziraphale there. “What’s your name?”  
“一个公国对大天使讲礼仪，似乎不太合适，是吧？” 拉斐尔的声音带着一丝不悦，他对阿齐拉费尔有些不满。“你叫什么名字？”

“Aziraphale, s-- Raf.”  “亚齐拉费尔，s--拉夫。”

“Well, Aziraphale, this is going to hurt quite a bit,” Raphael warned. Aziraphale nodded, and Raphael let go of his shoulder to grab the broken right wing with both hands. This time hurt worse than the last. Aziraphale bit his lip until he tasted ichor. He screamed through a clenched jaw, and then screamed aloud as Raphael pushed on far past what Aziraphale had been able to bear doing it himself.  
“嗯，亚齐拉费尔，这会相当痛的，”拉斐尔警告道。亚齐拉费尔点了点头，拉斐尔松开他的肩膀，用双手抓住破碎的右翅膀。这一次比上次更痛。亚齐拉费尔咬住嘴唇，尝到了神血的味道。他咬紧牙关尖叫，然后在拉斐尔继续施力时大声尖叫，远远超过了亚齐拉费尔自己能忍受的程度。

The joint slid into a natural angle.  
关节自然地滑入一个角度。

Raphael was talking. How long had he been speaking?  
拉斐尔在说话。他说了多久了？

“I’m-- sorry, s-- Rapha-- Raf. Say-- say again?”  
“对不起，我--我是拉--拉夫。请--请再说一遍？”

“Good set of pipes you’ve got there,” Raphael repeated, putting his hand back on Aziraphale’s shaking shoulder. “Bet if you sung they’d hear you half-way to the back of Heaven.”  
“你的嗓音真不错，”拉斐尔重复着，把手放回了阿齐拉费尔颤抖的肩膀上。“打赌如果你唱歌，声音能传到天堂的后半部分。”

“It’s-- it’s not-- in the principality duty roster,” Aziraphale said weakly, trying to focus on the blurred and blurring stars. Everything ached. The skin of his back had to be as burnt and shredded as his wings.  
“这--这不--不在公务表上，”阿齐拉费尔虚弱地说着，努力着将注意力集中在模糊而又模糊的星星上。一切都痛苦不堪。他的背部皮肤一定像他的翅膀一样被烧焦和撕裂了。

It was going to be a long healing process. He didn’t-- he didn’t dare ask for a lift. Gabriel would be _furious_ if he was paraded into Heaven in front of everyone looking this shabby and disheveled, being carried by a ranking angel from another department. At least now Aziraphale didn’t have to worry about the possibility of never flying again.  
这将是一个漫长的康复过程。他不敢要求搭车。如果他被一个来自其他部门的高级天使抬着在众人面前进入天堂，看起来邋遢不堪，加百列会非常生气的。至少现在亚齐拉费尔不必担心再也不能飞行的可能性了。

Raphael began to sing. It was a psalm of healing and renewal, filled with creative power and energy. He began in a tenor. During the second verse, Raphael threaded in a low bass counterpart. On the third he added a brilliantly soaring baritone, each voice singing slightly after the last.  
拉斐尔开始唱歌。这是一首充满创造力和能量的治愈和更新的圣诗。他以男高音开始。在第二节中，拉斐尔加入了一个低音的对位。在第三节中，他又加入了一个华丽高亢的男中音，每个声部都稍微滞后地唱着。

It was-- Aziraphale closed his eyes, the beauty of it exquisitely painful in a way that washed away the harrowing pain of his injuries. Warmth spread out and downward from his shoulders, winding down his spine and to the tips of his broken, battered, useless wings.  
这是——亚齐拉费尔闭上眼睛，它的美丽以一种令人痛苦的方式细腻地洗去了他受伤的痛苦。温暖从他的肩膀向下蔓延，沿着脊柱一直延伸到他破碎、破烂、无用的翅膀的尖端。

The voices began to fade. The final verse was sung by all three, then the bass, and then finally by the baritone alone.  
声音渐渐消散。最后一节由三人一起唱，然后是低音，最后由男中音独自演唱。

Aziraphale’s wings didn’t hurt at all. The music felt like gentle fingers combing his feathers, smoothing everything into place, even after it faded. The combing feeling made him shiver _very_ pleasantly.  
亚齐拉费尔的翅膀一点也不疼。音乐感觉就像温柔的手指梳理着他的羽毛，将一切都平顺地安放好，即使音乐渐渐消失后仍然如此。这种梳理的感觉让他非常愉快地颤抖着。

“That was…. Absolutely wonderful,” Aziraphale breathed.  
“太棒了……真是太棒了。”亚齐拉费尔喃喃自语。

“I’m not sure,” Raphael said doubtfully. The combing feeling stopped abruptly. “Never fixed wings before. You’d better test them out before you try anything with distance.”  
“我不确定。”拉斐尔怀疑地说道。梳理的感觉突然停止了。“以前从未修复过翅膀。在尝试任何远距离飞行之前，最好先测试一下。”

Aziraphale twisted to look, hardly daring to believe it. His wings didn’t hurt because they were fine. Graceful white feathers and strong, hale bones. Even his robe was repaired.  
亚齐拉费尔扭过头去看，几乎不敢相信。他的翅膀没有疼痛，因为它们完好无损。优雅的白色羽毛和强壮健康的骨骼。甚至他的长袍也修复好了。

“Oh, oh, thank you,” Aziraphale said, giving his wings an experimental set of flaps.  
“哦，哦，谢谢你。”亚齐拉费尔说着，试探性地扇动了一下他的翅膀。

“You can thank me if they work. Up you get.”  
如果它们起作用的话，你可以感谢我。起床吧。

Aziraphale stood. He circled the asteroid, then he took a longer run at a comet’s trail. That was followed by two experimental teleports. He had no sooner turned to Raphael to declare the wings functional (and thank him again) when Gabriel appeared out of the aether. Aziraphale almost crashed into a nearby planet.  
亚齐拉费尔站起来。他绕着小行星转了一圈，然后在一颗彗星的轨迹上跑了一段更长的距离。接着进行了两次实验性的瞬间传送。他刚刚转身对拉斐尔宣布翅膀可用（并再次感谢他），加百列就从虚空中出现了。亚齐拉费尔差点撞上了附近的一颗行星。

“Are you finished?” Gabriel’s voice was furious.  
“你完成了吗？”加布里埃尔的声音充满愤怒。

“We-- we were only testing them out, sir,” Aziraphale stammered. Oh, Almighty, he’d interrupted a senior angel’s work with his screaming, of course Gabriel was angry.  
“我们——我们只是在测试它们，先生。”阿齐拉费尔结结巴巴地说道。哦，全能者啊，他竟然在高级天使的工作中尖叫了起来，当然加百列会生气了。

“Get back to Heaven,” Gabriel said to Aziraphale even though he was glaring at Raphael, “I will deal with you later.”  
“回到天堂去吧，”加百列对亚齐拉费尔说，尽管他正瞪着拉斐尔，“我会稍后处理你。”

“Hey! Don’t you have a go at him because you’re angry with me.” Raphael had been hovering to watch the tests in case there was trouble. He dropped down, one golden wing blocking line of sight between Gabriel and Aziraphale.  
“嘿！你别因为生我气就冲他发火。”拉斐尔一直在旁边观察测试，以防出现麻烦。他降落下来，一只金色的翅膀挡住了加百列和阿齐拉费尔之间的视线。

“‘I don’t take orders from you.’” Gabriel’s voice lilted angrily, as if he was quoting someone. Aziraphale had expected Gabriel to be angry, but not like this.  
“‘我不听你的命令。’” 加百利的声音带着愤怒的语调，仿佛他在引用某人的话。亚齐拉费尔预料到加百利会生气，但没想到会是这样的愤怒。

“I’m certain Raf—ael,” Aziraphale corrected himself on using the shortened name as smoothly as he could, “didn’t mean to step on any jurisdictional toes.” He ducked sideways from behind his gold-feathered shield.  
“我确定拉夫——啊，阿齐拉费尔纠正自己尽可能流畅地使用了这个缩写名字——并不是故意触犯任何管辖权。”他从他那披着金色羽毛的盾牌后面侧身躲开。

“I am not going to repeat myself, Aziraphale.” Gabriel’s voice was flat, and he still wasn’t looking away from Raphael.  
“我不会再重复一遍，阿齐拉费尔。”加百列的声音平淡，他仍然没有从拉斐尔身上移开目光。

“Go on,” Raphael said quietly, returning the stare. Aziraphale hesitated, torn between following an order given by two superiors and a desire not to abandon the one who had been so kind to him.  
“继续吧。”拉斐尔轻声说道，回视着对方。阿齐拉费尔犹豫了一下，陷入了两位上级的命令和不愿离弃对他如此友善的人之间的纠结。

Obedience won out. 服从取得了胜利。

Later, much later, he heard that the two archangels had gotten into a row so severe that a Seraph, Lucifer, had dragged Raphael into a pocket dimension to cool down. Gabriel had arrived back in the home office in a foul mood. He had dressed Aziraphale down in front of everyone for being so easily distracted. No amount of apologies or attempts to explain that Raphael had commanded Aziraphale to test his wings had even slowed Gabriel down.  
后来，很久以后，他听说两位大天使发生了一场严重的争吵，以至于一个六翼天使，路西法，把拉斐尔拖进了一个小空间来冷静下来。加百列心情糟糕地回到了总部。他当众责备阿齐拉费尔，因为他太容易分心。无论多少道歉或者解释拉斐尔命令阿齐拉费尔测试他的翅膀，都无法减缓加百列的怒火。

“There’s going to be a duty rotation outside Heaven when creation is done,” Gabriel had said angrily. “You’re going to be there, on watch-and-watch, until the End Times. Do you understand me?”  
“当创世工作完成后，天堂外将会有一个轮班值勤的任务，”加百列愤怒地说道。“你将会在那里值班，直到末日来临。明白吗？”

“Yes, sir,” Aziraphale had said quietly. It would be a lonely posting, that was sure, but out of sight might mean out of mind. At least until his superior calmed down.  
“是的，先生。”亚齐拉费尔轻声说道。这将是一个孤独的岗位，那是肯定的，但离开视线可能意味着被忽视。至少在他的上级冷静下来之前是这样。

Seeing Raphael’s name on the list of the Fallen after Lucifer’s Rebellion had been a terrible shock. Raphael had been so kind, sung so splendidly. But it it had also seemed somehow inevitable.  
在路西法叛乱之后，看到拉斐尔的名字出现在堕落者名单上，真是一个可怕的震惊。拉斐尔曾经如此善良，歌声也如此辉煌。但这似乎也是不可避免的。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Aziraphale’s business was entirely out of control, his Yelp score was up to three and a half stars, and it was all Crowley’s fault.  
亚齐拉费尔的生意完全失控了，他的Yelp评分已经达到了三个半星，这完全是克劳利的错。

Oh, it had started off innocently enough, about a month after the false-start Apocalypse:  
哦，一切都是无辜的开始，就在虚假启示录之后的一个月：

“Do you mind if I do some light cleaning?”  
“你介意我做些轻微的清洁吗？”

Aziraphale had been to Hell for Crowley’s sentencing. He had seen how cramped, filthy, and untidy it was. As much as Aziraphale wanted to discourage customers, the idea of Crowley being reminded of Hell in the bookshop had been unendurable. So not only had Aziraphale agreed, he’d volunteered to let Crowley add some plants while the angel went to Germany to acquire a most delightful Augustinian manuscript he simply had to have.  
亚齐拉费尔曾去地狱参加克劳利的审判。他亲眼目睹了那里的狭小、肮脏和凌乱。尽管亚齐拉费尔想要打消顾客的兴趣，但让克劳利在书店里想起地狱的念头是无法忍受的。因此，亚齐拉费尔不仅同意了，还主动让克劳利添加了一些植物，而他自己则去德国寻找一本非常美妙的奥古斯丁手稿，他简直无法不拥有它。

“Some light cleaning” had turned out to be sweeping, scrubbing, mopping, and dusting like a Dutch goodwife. Crowley had even stripped the bookshelves to clean them. He had put the books back organized by genre and author, like his movie collection. Organized books took up less space, so Crowley had also pulled some of the books down from the upstairs rooms to fill in the empty spaces.  
“一些轻微的清洁”结果变成了像荷兰贤妻一样的扫地、擦洗、拖地和除尘。克劳利甚至拆下书架来清洁它们。他按照类型和作者重新整理了书籍，就像整理他的电影收藏一样。整理好的书籍占用更少的空间，所以克劳利还从楼上的房间拿下一些书来填补空白的地方。

By the time Aziraphale had returned, Crowley had installed wall-to-wall bookshelves in the upstairs and had condensed the remaining upstairs books into two rooms. He’d repaired the upstairs hallway lock. Then he’d then moved Aziraphale’s desk and computer into one of the rooms behind that locking door, and put a television in the same room. He had also moved Aziraphale’s closet into the farthest-back room. Crowley had revamped the entire downstairs back room into a kitchenette, condensing the other furniture into either the upstairs rooms or front-of-store shelves.  
当阿齐拉费尔回来的时候，克劳利已经在楼上安装了墙到墙的书架，并将剩下的楼上书籍整理到了两个房间里。他修好了楼上走廊的锁。然后，他将阿齐拉费尔的书桌和电脑搬到了那扇上锁的门后面的一个房间，并在同一个房间里放了一台电视。他还将阿齐拉费尔的衣柜搬到了最后一个房间。克劳利将整个楼下的后房间改造成了一个小厨房，将其他家具整理到了楼上的房间或店铺前面的货架上。

Lastly, Crowley had moved his entire jungle plus what was most certainly _at least_ a seven-hundred-pound plant nursery shopping spree into every room.  
最后，克劳利把他整个丛林加上至少七百磅的植物苗圃购物狂潮搬进了每个房间。

The demon had been so utterly proud of himself that Aziraphale hadn’t had the heart to explain that to _everyone else on the planet_ “light cleaning” and “exploding like a cleanliness bomb over every surface” were two entirely different phrases.  
恶魔对自己感到非常自豪，亚齐拉费尔没有勇气解释给地球上其他人听，“轻松打扫”和“像清洁炸弹一样在每个表面上爆炸”是两个完全不同的说法。

The backroom held much more wine than it had before. Aziraphale had drunk half of it anyway.  
后房里的酒比以前多得多。不过，阿齐拉费尔已经喝了一半了。

The bookshop itself had been no help at all. Oh, when Aziraphale put books away, the bookshop reorganized itself as it willed whenever it had an opinion. But apparently when _Crowley_ did things, the romance section stayed put and the more salacious materials in every genre stopped pulling themselves forward into their own section. It was rank betrayal.  
书店本身一点帮助都没有。哦，当阿齐拉费尔整理书籍时，书店会按照自己的意愿重新组织。但是显然，当克劳利做事情时，浪漫部分保持不变，而各种类型的淫秽材料则停止自行前进到它们自己的部分。这是背叛。

The shouting Crowley insisted was integral to plant care had also taken some getting used to. His plants were the most verdant Aziraphale had seen since Eden, though, so what did the angel know?  
克劳利大声喊叫坚持认为这对植物的照料至关重要，这也需要一些时间来适应。然而，自从伊甸园以来，克劳利的植物是阿齐拉费尔见过最翠绿的，所以天使又能知道什么呢？

Even without changing his hours, business had ticked up sharply from practically non-existent to virtually non-existent. It should have been a warning.  
即使没有改变工作时间，生意从几乎不存在到几乎不存在的程度迅速增长。这本应该是一个警告。

After the _fifth_ first edition Aziraphale had been unable to dissuade a customer from purchasing, Aziraphale had complained at some length and vocabulary.  
在第五本首版书中，阿齐拉费尔无法劝阻一位顾客购买后，他进行了一番长篇大论的抱怨。

Crowley had moved Aziraphale’s most prized books upstairs and pulled the rest downstairs. The table and thrones from Crowley’s flat had migrated into one of the upstairs rooms. The demon had placed a sign that read “not for sale” on the stairs. Crowley called it a “reading room,” even though it was technically two rooms.  
克劳利把阿齐拉费尔最珍贵的书搬到楼上，把其他的书搬到楼下。克劳利公寓里的桌子和王座也迁移到了楼上的一个房间。恶魔在楼梯上放了一个写着“不出售”的牌子。克劳利称之为“阅读室”，尽管从技术上来说是两个房间。

Giving researchers a place to read and take notes without actually _purchasing_ Aziraphale’s books had put a dent in purchase requests, the angel had to admit. Most of the academics brought delicious treats or good wine with, and the conversation was interesting.  
给研究人员提供一个阅读和做笔记的地方，而不必真正购买阿齐拉费尔的书籍，这无疑对购买请求造成了一定的影响，天使不得不承认。大多数学者都带来了美味的食物或好酒，交谈也很有趣。

The bookshop’s Yelp score had gone up from half a star to one and a half stars. Another opportunity to reverse course that Aziraphale had passed by.  
这家书店在Yelp上的评分从半颗星提升到了一颗半星。这是阿齐拉费尔错过的另一个扭转局面的机会。

After the _eleventh_ book Aziraphale had been unable to talk his way out of parting with, Crowley had floated the idea of buying duplicates and books Aziraphale didn’t actually care about to put on the shelves. Bones to throw the wolves.  
在第十一本书之后，阿齐拉费尔再也无法通过口才来避免与书分离。克劳利提出了购买重复的书和阿齐拉费尔并不真正在意的书来放在书架上的想法。这些只是为了应付外界的压力。

The idea had some merit, and it wasn’t as if creating money out of thin air was terribly difficult.  
这个想法有一些价值，而且创造出虚拟的金钱并不是非常困难。

Somewhere about that time, Crowley had put a bed in the upstairs farthest-back room to nap in. Aziraphale didn’t see the appeal of sleep the same way Crowley did. However, the bed had proved to have other uses Aziraphale enjoyed a great deal. A couch had appeared in the office.  
大约在那个时候，克劳利在楼上最后一间房间放了一张床来午睡。阿齐拉费尔并不像克劳利那样看重睡眠的吸引力。然而，这张床却被证明有其他让阿齐拉费尔非常喜欢的用途。办公室里也出现了一张沙发。

Selling the duplicates had been the beginning of the end. “Hours by appointment” had become “Aziraphale’s phone ringing regularly with appointment bookings.” Crowley had brought his answering machine over to stem the tide. No matter how Aziraphale adjusted his hours, Google Business aggregated his customers’ cellphone data and helpfully posted the new busy times for people to pop in.  
卖掉重复的商品已经是末日的开始了。"需预约"变成了"阿齐拉费尔的手机不断响起预约的电话"。克劳利带来了他的电话答录机来控制这股潮流。无论阿齐拉费尔如何调整营业时间，谷歌商务都会整合顾客的手机数据，并乐意地发布新的繁忙时间，方便顾客前来光顾。

Explaining where he was getting the money to pay for the duplicates in his meticulously kept books and equally-meticulous tax records started to become a problem.  
解释他从哪里得到钱来支付他精心保管的账簿和一丝不苟的税务记录中的重复费用开始成为一个问题。

“I’ll lease out my flat,” Crowley had suggested helpfully. “I’m here most of the time, anyway. All that’s left is some art and statutes.”  
“我会把我的公寓出租出去，”克劳利热心地建议道。“反正我大部分时间都在这里。只剩下一些艺术品和雕像了。”

Bringing in the art and statutes had been the final nail in the coffin of the bookshop’s existence as a front for Aziraphale’s collection. Three and a half stars. _Three and a half stars,_ and he spent the actual flat money as well the miracled money attributed to the flat on inventory. People were beginning to commission the angel to find books they couldn’t locate on their own.  
将艺术品和雕像引入书店，最终成为了阿齐拉费尔藏书的致命一击。三个半星。三个半星，他不仅花了实实在在的钱，还用了通过奇迹创造的钱来购买库存。人们开始委托这位天使寻找他们自己找不到的书籍。

He was good at it. That was the worst.  
他很擅长这个。那是最糟糕的。

Aziraphale was actually going to have to set aside money to pay taxes this year. He’d had to open a bank account. A _bank account_. In a bank. With a teller. There were people in his shop at _least_ once a day, and he was receiving acknowledgements in academic papers for his “reading room.” Each acknowledgment spawned more phone calls, more people, more--  
亚齐拉费尔今年实际上不得不留出一些钱来交税。他不得不开了一个银行账户。一个银行账户。在一家银行。和一个出纳员。他的店里每天至少有人来，他的“阅读室”还收到了学术论文的致谢。每一个致谢都引发了更多的电话，更多的人，更多的……

And it was _entirely_ Crowley’s fault.  
这完全是克劳利的错。

Aziraphale had been quite clear on that point.  
阿齐拉费尔在这一点上非常明确。

The utterly delicious duck and the equally expensive wine Crowley had purchased to mark seven months since the Apocalypse-that-wasn’t did not change it. The prinsesstarta for dessert didn’t change it. Leaning back on the office couch, Aziraphale’s back pressed to Crowley’s chest with the demon’s chin resting on the crown of his head didn’t change it. Crowley’s his crow-black wings curled around them both like a blanket didn’t change it.  
克劳利购买的美味无比的鸭肉和同样昂贵的葡萄酒，用来庆祝自从那场未发生的启示录以来的七个月，并没有改变这一切。作为甜点的公主蛋糕也没有改变这一切。阿齐拉费尔倚靠在办公室的沙发上，背靠着克劳利的胸膛，恶魔的下巴靠在他头顶的王冠上，也没有改变这一切。克劳利那乌鸦般黑色的翅膀像一条毯子般围绕着他们两个，也没有改变这一切。

“I’m an angel,” Aziraphale finished anxiously. “I’m not supposed to be running a bookshop with my lover. You tempted me to greed _and_ lust.”  
“我是一个天使，”阿齐拉费尔焦虑地说完。“我不应该和我的爱人一起经营一家书店。你引诱我贪婪和欲望。”

“Didn’t have to tempt very hard,” Crowley said. “You’re happy, angel.”  
“不用费太多力气就成功了，”克劳利说道。“你很开心，天使。”

Aziraphale tightened his fingers around Crowley’s. Framing it as a complaint was safer than gratitude. Still, if Crowley wanted an honest admission, Aziraphale wasn’t certain he could refuse over a-- a petty superstition, really.  
亚齐拉费尔紧紧握住克劳利的手。将其表述为抱怨比表达感激更为安全。然而，如果克劳利想要一个真诚的承认，亚齐拉费尔不确定自己能否拒绝，只是因为一种小小的迷信罢了。

“I am happy, may I be forgiven,” Aziraphale said as softly as he could and still be intelligible.  
“我很高兴，愿我得到宽恕。”亚齐拉费尔尽量轻声说道，以确保自己的话能被听清。

Crowley stiffened in alarm beneath Aziraphale.  
克劳利在亚齐拉费尔的身下惊恐地僵硬了起来。

“What?” Aziraphale asked, even though he had enough of an idea of what it was that his hands tingled and his chest ached. He never should have said anything. Could he pretend he didn’t mean it, that he had been lying for Crowley’s benefit? Too late, most likely, and who would believe him?  
“什么？”阿齐拉费尔问道，尽管他已经有了一个大致的想法，他的手发麻，胸口疼痛。他永远不应该说出来。他能假装自己不是认真的吗？他能假装为了克劳利的利益而撒谎吗？很可能已经太迟了，而且谁会相信他呢？

“Don’t know,” Crowley said tightly. “It’s like a black hole, only worse.”  
“不知道。”克劳利紧张地说道。“就像是一个黑洞，只不过更糟。”

Aziraphale couldn’t feel anything, but that was meaningless. If he’d learned one thing from the failed Apocalypse, it was that he and Crowley could most assuredly not sense the same things.  
亚齐拉费尔感觉不到任何东西，但这毫无意义。如果说他从那次失败的启示中学到了一件事，那就是他和克劳利绝对无法感知相同的事物。

Crowley’s arms tightened around Aziraphale. His wings locked tightly. The shop was gone. Crowley had pulled them into the desert out of time, but it was different. It shimmered like a fading mirage everywhere Aziraphale looked. Aziraphale didn’t have to see Crowley’s face to know the demon’s eyes were lid-to-lid yellow.  
克劳利的手臂紧紧地搂住了阿齐拉费尔。他的翅膀也紧紧地收拢起来。店铺消失了。克劳利把他们带到了一个超越时间的沙漠中，但这里与以往不同。无论阿齐拉费尔往哪里看，这个地方都闪烁着像是逐渐消失的幻影。阿齐拉费尔不需要看到克劳利的脸，就知道这个恶魔的眼睛现在是一片黄色。

When they dropped back into time, they fell a foot and change to the ground. The couch was gone. The television, desk, and computer were gone. The walls had different paint. There were racks of clothing everywhere. But the room was the same shape and the view from the window was the same, they were definitely in the same building.  
当他们回到过去时，他们掉到了地上一英尺多一点。沙发不见了。电视、书桌和电脑也不见了。墙壁上涂着不同的颜色。到处都是衣服架。但房间的形状和窗外的景色都一样，他们明显还在同一栋建筑物里。

Sirens began screaming. 警报开始尖叫。

A security system. A security system Aziraphale had refused to buy, opting for a bank account and accepting non-cash transactions instead.  
一个安全系统。一个安全系统，亚齐拉费尔拒绝购买，选择了银行账户，并接受非现金交易。

Crowley was pale and sluggish, stumbling as Aziraphale draped the demon’s arm over his shoulders and hauled him to his feet. He wrapped his other arm wrapped around Crowley’s waist as he half-dragged them both downstairs. His bookshop had become a charity shop in a matter of seconds.  
克劳利脸色苍白，行动迟缓，当阿齐拉费尔将恶魔的手搭在自己肩上，将他扶起时，克劳利踉跄了一下。阿齐拉费尔的另一只手搂住克劳利的腰，他们一起下楼时，他的书店在几秒钟内变成了一家慈善商店。

A snap of his fingers unlocked the door. Aziraphale pulled them both outside. He could hear the police cars. They couldn’t get arrested. Not with Crowley’s eyes.  
他轻轻一弹手指，门就打开了。亚齐拉费尔把他们俩都拉到了外面。他能听到警车的声音。他们不能被逮捕。因为有克劳利的眼睛。

Aziraphale teleported them both to Berkley Square. He scared half a years’s growth out of a transient.  
亚齐拉费尔将他们两人传送到伯克利广场。他把一个流浪者吓得半年的胡子都掉了。

“Don’t worry, angel,” Crowley slurred. “Be fine in a minute.”  
“别担心，亲爱的，”克劳利含糊地说道。“一会儿就好了。”

“What happened?” Aziraphale demanded, but Crowley was already unconscious. Neither angels nor demons, as a general rule, passed out. Shielding them had taken every reserve of power the demon had, including what he used to animate his corporation. 

Aziraphale laid Crowley on a bench. The angel sat wretchedly on the edge. The park would be patrolled by police to chase homeless people away from sleeping on the benches. Aziraphale would have to alter their memories as they came. Aziraphale pushed the wine from his system, letting it bleed onto the ground. The bottles that had once held it were gone.  
亚齐拉费尔将克劳利放在长椅上。天使痛苦地坐在边缘。公园将会有警察巡逻，把无家可归的人赶走，不让他们在长椅上睡觉。亚齐拉费尔将不得不在他们来的时候改变他们的记忆。亚齐拉费尔将酒从自己的体内排出，让它渗透到地面上。曾经盛放酒的瓶子已经消失了。

The angel rested his forehead in his hands and closed his eyes. He was such a fool. From his lips to Heaven’s ears.  
天使将额头放在双手上，闭上了眼睛。他真是个傻瓜。从他的嘴唇到天堂的耳朵。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Azazel watched Arthur’s champion cross the field. He walked like his armor weighed no more than clothes. That meant angel, not human.  
阿撒谢尔注视着亚瑟的冠军穿过田野。他走路的样子就像他的盔甲不比衣服重。这意味着他是天使，而不是人类。

How delightful. 太令人愉快了。

Meeting his replacement adversary was so much more interesting than cutting down some Welshman stupid enough to challenge an undefeated enemy in lieu of military engagement.  
与他的替代对手会面比击败一名愚蠢到挑战一位无敌敌人而不是进行军事交锋的威尔士人更有趣。

Azazel had flipped the last three heavenly agents. Making it four-for-four would be quite the feather in the wing.  
阿撒泽尔已经翻转了最后三个天使。如果能够全胜，那将是一项了不起的成就。

“You know you’re wasting your time, my dear,” Azazel said gently. No one expected civility from a demon. The shock worked wonders for getting one’s foot in the door. “You save a soul and foment peace, I damn a soul and foment war. We’re just cancelling each other out.”  
“亲爱的，你知道你在浪费时间，”阿撒泽尔温柔地说道。没有人会期待恶魔的礼貌。这种震惊对于打开大门非常有效。“你拯救一个灵魂，促进和平，我诅咒一个灵魂，煽动战争。我们只是互相抵消而已。”

“Fine. How about we don’t, say we did, and knock off early?”  
好的，我们干脆就不做了，假装做完了，然后提前下班怎么样？

Azazel flipped up his visor. He remembered that voice. “Raphael? Is that you under there?”  
阿撒泽尔翻起他的面罩。他记得那个声音。“拉斐尔？你就是在那里吗？”

The white knight flipped up his visor as well, fixing the demon with unamused purple eyes.  
白骑士也翻起面甲，用不悦的紫色眼睛盯着恶魔。

“Are you still an archangel?” Azazel asked, not believing what his own eyes were showing him. A demotion – could Heaven even demote people? -- was the only reason he could think of for the _archangel of healing and the cosmos_ being billeted to babysitting humanity.  
“你还是一个大天使吗？”阿撒泽尔问道，他自己的眼睛都不敢相信所看到的。降职——天堂真的会降职吗？这是他能想到的唯一原因，为什么治愈和宇宙的大天使会被派去照看人类。

“What kind of a stupid question is that?,” Raphael demanded. “‘Still an archangel.’ What else am I going to be, an aardvark?”  
“那是什么蠢问题？”拉斐尔要求道。“‘依然是大天使’。我还能是什么，土豚吗？”

“Don’t you have a department to run, then?” the demon asked. There were four archangels. Heaven couldn’t simply whip up a fifth to free up Raphael. Could they? That would be a big problem for Hell if they could.  
“那你难道没有一个部门要管理吗？”恶魔问道。天堂有四位大天使，他们不能随便再多出一位来解放拉斐尔。难道他们可以吗？如果可以的话，那对地狱来说将是一个大问题。

“I do,” Raphael stated impatiently. “But you keep turning principalities into demons, so Heaven decided to send someone you can’t just zap into compliance. Can we just- move this right along?”  
“我知道，”拉斐尔不耐烦地说道。“但是你总是把公国变成恶魔，所以天堂决定派个你无法轻易解决的人来。我们能不能快点进行下去？”

Azazel could feel his mouth working, but no sound was coming out.  
阿撒谢尔感觉到自己的嘴巴在动，但却没有发出声音。

“It’s not mind control,” finally emerged.  
“这不是心灵控制。” 最终浮现出来。

“Oh. Oh. Oh, of course,” Raphael said with an utterly un-angelic amount of sarcasm. “It’s not mind control. If you say so. Let me just pop back to Heaven and send down another angel for you to work your sorcery on.”  
“哦。哦。哦，当然了，”拉斐尔用一种完全不像天使的讽刺口吻说道。“这不是心灵控制。如果你这么说的话。让我回到天堂，再派一个天使给你施展你的魔法。”

“I’m not lying!” “我没有撒谎！”

“You’re a demon. It’s what you do,” Raphael stated. “Now are we going to get on with this, hellfire, or do we both just kick off home?”  
“你就是个恶魔，这是你的本性。”拉斐尔说道。“现在我们是要继续下去，还是各自回家？”

“I’m not just kicking off home. It’s out of the question,” Azazel protested, even though he wasn’t going to win in a fight against an archangel without having had an opportunity prior to stack the deck in his favor. Flipping him was also not looking like a likely outcome (see the previous statement regarding the importance of advance preparation).  
“我不只是离开家而已。这是不可能的事情。”阿撒泽尔抗议道，尽管他在与大天使的战斗中没有机会事先做好充分准备来扭转局势。而且，让他改变立场也不太可能（请参考前面关于提前准备的重要性的陈述）。

“You said yourself we’re cancelling each other out,” Raphael carried on. “We tell our bosses we stalemated out, I go back to my department’s quarterlies, and you go back to…. Whatever it is you do.”  
“你自己说过我们互相抵消了，”拉斐尔继续说道。“我们告诉上司我们陷入了僵局，我回去处理部门的季度报告，而你回去……无论你在做什么。”

“I am not having this conversation,” Azazel announced, turning around and walking away.  
“我不参与这个对话。”阿撒泽尔宣布着，转身离开。

“Fine.” Raphael sighed as he flipped his visor down. “Long way it is.”  
“好吧。”拉斐尔叹了口气，将面罩翻下。“那就走远一点吧。”

“Fine,” Azazel repeated, still walking away.  
“好吧。”阿撒泽尔重复着，依然走开。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Crowley was dormant for three days, one of which involved snow. Aziraphale tried an experimental teleport to Crowley’s apartment, but like the shop, it had changed. The nice young lady and her children had been quite shocked. Aziraphale had taken them back to the park. It wasn’t as if either of them could die of exposure.  
克劳利沉睡了三天，其中一天下了雪。阿齐拉费尔试图进行一次实验性的传送到克劳利的公寓，但就像商店一样，它也发生了变化。那位友善的年轻女士和她的孩子们感到非常震惊。阿齐拉费尔把他们带回了公园。毕竟，他们俩都不会因为暴露在外而死亡。

At night, Aziraphale watched the transients create fires for themselves in the absence of police presence. He quietly healed any frostbite or chronic diseases. During the day, he watched the respectable denizens of the city bustle by, wishing each other the joys of the season with one breath and missing its point with the next. Aziraphale sent away the police at all hours, something his fellow transients reaped the benefit of as much as he did.  
夜晚，阿齐拉费尔静静地观察着流浪者们在没有警察的情况下为自己生火取暖。他悄悄地治愈了他们身上的冻伤和慢性疾病。白天，他看着城市里那些体面的居民匆匆而过，一边用一口气祝福彼此节日的快乐，却在下一刻错过了其中的意义。阿齐拉费尔随时都会把警察赶走，这对他的同伴流浪者们同样有好处。

Crowley swore, rolled over, and fell off the bench. He made a sound that could only be described as, “blrrgh.” Aziraphale grabbed the demon’s arms and urged him up into a sitting position on the bench.  
克劳利咒骂了一声，翻了个身，从长凳上摔了下来。他发出了一种只能用“咕噜”来形容的声音。亚齐拉费尔抓住恶魔的手臂，劝他坐在长凳上。

“How long was I out?” Crowley asked.  
克劳利问道：“我昏迷了多久？”

“Three days,” Aziraphale said. “I’m so sorry. This is entirely my fault. I knew better.”  
“三天。”亚齐拉费尔说道。“非常抱歉。这完全是我的错。我应该知道得更清楚。”

“That wasn’t just a miracle erasing the shop,” Crowley said, leaning back and closing his eyes. He didn’t even try to deny that destroying everything Aziraphale cherished the minute Aziraphale declared himself happy wasn’t something Uriel and Sandalphon would do. “That was--” Crowley shook his head. “Heaven doesn’t have that kind of juice.”  
“那不仅仅是一场神奇的店铺消失，”克劳利说着，向后靠在椅子上，闭上了眼睛。他甚至没有试图否认，当阿齐拉费尔宣布自己幸福时，摧毁阿齐拉费尔珍视的一切并不是乌列尔和桑达尔芬会做的事情。“那是——”克劳利摇了摇头。“天堂没有那种力量。”

“God does,” Aziraphale countered.  
"上帝会的，"亚齐拉费尔反驳道。

“If God wanted to punish you, it’d be black wings and a sharp trip downstairs.”  
如果上帝想要惩罚你，那就是黑色的翅膀和一次陡峭的下坠之旅。

Aziraphale couldn’t hide his anxious expression. Crowley wasn’t wrong. He had said before the Event that it had felt like a black hole, not spellwork.  
亚齐拉费尔无法掩饰他焦虑的表情。克劳利说得没错。他之前曾说过那次事件感觉像是黑洞，而不是法术。

“You said you felt something like a black hole only more severe. Why?” Aziraphale doubted this was a natural occurrence, but he supposed it was possible. Aziraphale didn’t know much about celestial phenomena at all.  
“你说你感觉到了一种像黑洞一样但更严重的东西。为什么？”阿齐拉费尔怀疑这不是自然现象，但他认为这是可能的。阿齐拉费尔对天体现象并不了解。

“You know those… those things humans use to lift bits of building with? The big machines with the long arms?”  
你知道那些...人类用来举起建筑材料的东西吗？那些有长臂的大机器？

“Geese?” Aziraphale guessed. No, that wasn’t right. It was a bird name, though, that much he was certain of.  
“鹅？”亚齐拉费尔猜测道。不，那不对。不过，那是一个鸟的名字，他对此非常确定。

“Well, those things. They’ve got a... big weight on the other side from the load for balance and such. Black holes have a, well, singularity, not that you’d know what that is, but this thing inside them does the same job for everything else: matter, dark matter. Not exactly, but – close enough. Anyway, the thing at the center, around it the usual laws of physics don’t apply. Closer you get to it, more that’s true. Get too close and--” Crowley shook his head. “I’ve been clipped pretty close before. It felt the same. Just. More of it.”  
嗯，那些东西。它们在另一边有一个很大的重量来平衡负载之类的东西。黑洞有一个，嗯，奇点，不过你可能不知道那是什么，但是它们内部的这个东西对其他一切起到了同样的作用：物质，暗物质。虽然不完全一样，但差不多。总之，中心的那个东西，周围的物理定律不适用。越靠近它，这个情况就越真实。靠得太近的话——”克劳利摇了摇头。“我以前被剪得很近。感觉一样。只是。更多而已。”

Aziraphale watched the human children throwing snowballs in the square while he parsed that. He pushed aside his annoyance that Crowley was clearly dumbing down his explanation. He’d said to himself the hard sciences weren’t his area, and he could hardly be expected to know everything any more than Crowley could be expected to know nothing just because he wouldn’t pick up a book if his life depended on it.  
亚齐拉费尔看着人类孩子们在广场上扔雪球，同时他在琢磨着那个问题。他把克劳利明显简化解释的恼火放在一边。他曾经说过自己不擅长自然科学，不能期望他像克劳利一样无所不知，就像克劳利因为不愿意看书而一无所知一样。

Right. Focus. 对。专注。

“So it felt like the regular laws of physics were ceasing to apply,” Aziraphale mused aloud. The Event had felt like the socket-pedestals of reality themselves. They really only knew one person besides God who could manipulate reality itself.  
“所以感觉就像是物理定律不再适用了，”亚齐拉费尔沉思着说道。这个事件感觉就像是现实本身的插座基座。除了上帝之外，他们真的只认识一个能够操纵现实的人。

“I thought Adam lost his powers when he substituted Mr. Young for Satan?” Aziraphale voiced his theory aloud.  
“我以为当亚当把杨先生代替撒旦时，他失去了他的力量？”亚齐拉费尔大声表达了他的理论。

“So did I.” Crowley was quiet. “If we’re going to move, I’m going to need glasses.” He held out his hand.  
“我也是。”克劳利沉默了一会儿。“如果我们要搬家，我需要眼镜。”他伸出了手。

“They were destroyed along with the rest of the shop, I’m sorry.”  
他们和店里的其他东西一起被摧毁了，很抱歉。

“Then miracle me up a new pair.”  
那就给我制造一双新的奇迹吧。

It was worrisome that Crowley couldn’t even manage such a minor sorcery after three days. Still, Aziraphale did as requested, whipping up the lovely pair the demon had worn in the 1850s.  
克劳利连续三天都无法完成如此微不足道的魔法，这让人担忧。尽管如此，亚齐拉费尔还是按照要求，制作了那个恶魔在19世纪50年代曾经穿过的漂亮鞋子。

“Angel,” Crowley reproached, even as he slid them on.  
“天使，” 克劳利责备道，尽管他还是戴上了它们。

“They’re vintage,” Aziraphale said primly. “Vintage is ‘in.’” Crowley made a low, growling sound. He pushed himself up off the bench.  
“它们是复古的，”阿齐拉费尔端庄地说道。“复古正流行。”克劳利发出了低沉的咆哮声。他从长凳上站了起来。

It was likely that the Bentley had been purged along with everything else. Even if the Bentley hadn’t been destroyed, if Crowley couldn’t magic up glasses he certainly couldn’t magic up driving. Aziraphale didn’t know how to drive with or without magic. Aziraphale settled for hailing a cab by standing on the curb and waiting with the other Christmas season foot traffic. The driver balked at the hour and a half drive to Tadfield. Aziraphale pulled a couple of hundred-pound notes out of the aether to change his opinion vis-à-vis lost income.  
很可能那辆宾利车已经和其他东西一起被清除了。即使宾利车没有被摧毁，如果克劳利无法用魔法制造眼镜，他肯定也无法用魔法开车。阿齐拉费尔不知道如何开车，无论有没有魔法。阿齐拉费尔只好站在路边等待其他圣诞季节的行人一起拦出租车。司机对去塔德菲尔德一个半小时的车程表示犹豫。阿齐拉费尔从虚空中拿出几张百磅纸币，改变了他对失去收入的看法。

“Cranes,” Crowley said just as they exited the London city limits.  
“伦敦市区限制已经过去了，”克劳利说道，他们刚刚离开伦敦市区。

“Oh, good lord,” Aziraphale sighed.  
"哦，天哪，"亚齐拉费尔叹了口气。

They had just turned off the main road to Tadfield when Crowley shot upright. A 1926 black Bentley had cut in in front of them.  
当他们刚刚从主路转向塔德菲尔德时，克劳利突然坐直了身子。一辆1926年的黑色宾利突然插入到他们前面。

Not just a Bentley – _the_ Bentley. It didn’t even have lights on in the darkness.  
不仅仅是一辆宾利 - 它是宾利。在黑暗中甚至没有开灯。

“My car! Who--” Crowley rapped sharply on the glass separating them from the driver. “He stole my car! Follow him!”  
“我的车！谁--” 克劳利猛敲着将他们与司机隔开的玻璃。“他偷了我的车！跟上他！”

“Hey, this is not a police car--” the cab driver protested.  
“嘿，这不是一辆警车——”出租车司机抗议道。

Aziraphale passed forward another bill through the slider.  
亚齐拉费尔透过滑槽再次递出一张账单。

“--but they do citizen’s arrests here, as far as I know.”  
“--但据我所知，他们在这里可以进行市民逮捕。”

Aziraphale’s lips thinned at the lack of civic-mindedness, but the driver was tailing the Bentley as instructed. When the Bentley began to drive at speeds more akin to what Crowley usually drove at, no amount of money would persuade the cab driver to match pace on the narrow, potentially icy, road. Crowley placed his hand on the ceiling, clearly trying to magic the car into driving faster. Nothing happened.  
阿齐拉费尔的嘴唇因为缺乏公民意识而变得紧绷，但司机按照指示紧随着那辆宾利车。当宾利车开始以克劳利通常开的速度行驶时，再多的钱也无法说服出租车司机在狭窄、可能结冰的道路上与其保持同样的速度。克劳利把手放在车顶上，显然试图用魔法让车子加速。然而什么也没有发生。

“Angel!” “天使！”

Aziraphale drew his hand down, snapping his fingers. The Bentley’s front left tire blew.  
亚齐拉费尔抬起手，咔嗒一声，他的手指响了。宾利的前左轮爆胎了。

“Not that!” 不是那个！

The Bentley careened across the roadway, the smoke from the destroyed tire blending in with the roostertails of snow. The cab driver slammed on his brakes. Aziraphale concentrated on keeping the cab from skidding into a tree and killing (or discorporating, as the case may be) everyone. The cab finally slid to a halt with an ungodly grinding sound. In the headlights, Aziraphale could see that the Bentley had also managed to stop without hitting anything. The cab driver was swearing as profusely as Crowley.  
宾利在道路上猛冲而过，被毁的轮胎冒出的烟雾与飞溅的雪花混为一体。出租车司机猛踩刹车。阿齐拉费尔全神贯注地控制着出租车，防止它滑向树木并造成伤亡（或者说解体，具体情况而定）。出租车最终发出难以置信的摩擦声停了下来。在车头灯的照射下，阿齐拉费尔看到宾利也成功地停了下来，没有撞到任何东西。出租车司机和克劳利一样狂骂不已。

The minute the cab stopped, Crowley jumped out, promising every possible damnation to Aziraphale if there was so much as a scratch on the paint. Aziraphale opened the other door.  
出租车一停下来，克劳利就跳了出去，对阿齐拉费尔发誓，如果车漆上有一丝划痕，他将会遭受各种可怕的诅咒。阿齐拉费尔打开了另一扇车门。

“Are you insane?” he heard Crowley demand, his voice different, only to be quickly followed by, “eeiggshit.”  
“你疯了吗？”他听到克劳利的声音不同寻常地质问道，紧接着又迅速传来一声“该死”。

The second Aziraphale closed the door, the cab pulled out onto the road sharply enough to spray Aziraphale with dirt and snow. Crowley’s door slammed shut from the acceleration.  
当亚齐拉费尔关上门的瞬间，出租车急速驶出道路，足够猛烈地喷溅亚齐拉费尔一身泥土和雪花。克劳利的车门因加速而砰然关闭。

With the cab gone, the woods were black as pitch.  
出租车走了，树林变得一片漆黑。

“Let there be light.” The snap of Aziraphale’s fingers echoed oddly, and the woods began to glow.  
“让光明存在。”阿齐拉费尔的手指响起了奇怪的声音，森林开始发出光芒。

It was glowing from twin spheres of light.  
它从两个光球中散发着耀眼的光芒。

The car thief looked like Crowley in face and body. But he wore no dark glasses, his eyes weren’t yellow, and his long red hair was tied neatly back. The clothes were different, too, a sleek navy-blue three-piece with no tie and his shirt open at the throat. A compromise between Crowley’s desire for casual fashionableness and – Heaven’s dress code.  
汽车贼的长相和身材都像克劳利。但他没有戴黑色眼镜，眼睛也不是黄色的，他的长红发也整齐地扎起来了。衣服也不同，是一套时髦的深蓝色三件套，没有领带，衬衫敞开着领口。这是克劳利对休闲时尚和天堂着装规定之间的妥协。

Crowley – black clothes and black glasses – was standing on the side of the road gaping. He wasn’t even making his chest look like he was breathing.  
克劳利——穿着黑衣服、戴着黑眼镜——站在路边目瞪口呆。他甚至没有让胸膛看起来像在呼吸。

“Hellfire, your books say anything about this?” the false Crowley asked. The real Crowley’s voice had a coarseness to the consonants, almost a smoker’s voice. This version’s consonants were smooth and rich. An archangel’s voice was a weapon, but not many would think about Heaven crippling it in a demon before eviction. This level of attention to detail in facsimile was worrisome.  
“地狱之火，你的书有没有提到这个？”伪造的克劳利问道。真正的克劳利的声音带有一种粗糙的辅音，几乎像是一个吸烟者的声音。而这个版本的辅音则是流畅而丰富。一个大天使的声音是一种武器，但很少有人会想到天堂会在驱逐前削弱一个恶魔的声音。这种对细节的关注令人担忧。

When “hellfire” stepped from around the Bentley, it was Aziraphale’s turn for mute staring. It was a false version of himself, in a suit nearly identical to the one he himself was wearing. Nearly identical – except it was coal black, like his false self’s eyes.  
当“地狱火”从宾利车旁走出来时，阿齐拉费尔也呆呆地盯着他。那是一个虚假的自己，穿着一套几乎和他自己一模一样的西装。几乎一模一样，除了那套西装是煤黑色的，就像他虚假自我的眼睛一样。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Raphael was a conundrum. 拉斐尔是个谜团。

Most angels had very little in the way of critical thinking skills. “Heaven is Good, Hell is Bad” was about as far as they went and all they assumed anyone needed to know. Once you got their little minds working on any sort of actual problem – dead children during the Flood, Jesus on the stake – they ran themselves in mental circles until their wings turned black.  
大多数天使在批判性思维方面都很欠缺。对于他们来说，“天堂是好的，地狱是坏的”已经是极限了，他们认为这就是所有人需要知道的。一旦你让他们的小脑袋去思考任何实际问题——比如洪水中的死去的孩子，钉在十字架上的耶稣——他们就会在思维的圈子里打转，直到他们的翅膀变黑。

Poyel, the third adversary, had practically Felled himself. He’d been absolutely useless with humans in general and Romans in particular. After their fourth competing assignment had chosen Azazel’s temptations of the flesh over Poyel’s heavy-handed urgings toward temperance, Azazel had suggested the angel try wine to understand the appeal. That had ended with an angry, inebriated angel grabbing Azazel’s wrist and demanding to be shown “what was so good about the other thing.” Azazel had explained he generally urged humans toward each other, not toward himself, and tried to pull his arm away. Poyel had tightened his grip painfully. Poyel hadn’t been willing to risk polluting a human soul with lust or risk creating a nephil by coupling with a human.  
Poyel，第三个对手，几乎自己就倒下了。他对人类一般和罗马人尤其无能为力。在第四次竞争任务中，选择了阿撒泽尔对肉欲的引诱，而不是Poyel对节制的强硬劝告，阿撒泽尔建议这位天使尝试一下酒，以理解其吸引力。结果是，愤怒而醉醺醺的天使抓住了阿撒泽尔的手腕，要求看看“其他东西有什么好的”。阿撒泽尔解释说，他通常是鼓励人类之间的交往，而不是鼓励人们追求他自己，并试图挣脱他的手臂。Poyel痛苦地加紧了握力。Poyel不愿冒着污染人类灵魂的危险，也不愿冒着与人类交媾产生巨人后代的风险。

But, as he’d explained at no small length, a demon couldn’t even _have_ virtue to protect and Azazel was going to die at Armageddon no matter what he did in the meantime. Poyel had also voiced his opinion of Azazel’s intellect (low) and how pleasurable Azazel would find the act (very).  
但正如他曾经详细解释过的那样，恶魔甚至没有道德来保护自己，无论他在此期间做什么，阿撒泽尔都将在末日战争中死去。波伊尔还表达了对阿撒泽尔智力水平（低）以及他对这种行为的愉悦程度（非常高）的看法。

Azazel had intended compliance as a stepping-stone to making Poyel question absolutes. He certainly hadn’t expected holy fire to appear from nowhere, burning Poyel’s halo and blackening his wings. The Almighty hadn’t merely refused to wait for Heavenly jurisprudence, God hadn’t even waited for Poyel to insert himself into Azazel’s body. If Azazel had taken more pleasure from Poyel’s screaming than he had in the “temptation” itself, that was simply to be expected. Azazel _was_ a demon, after all.  
阿撒泽尔本打算通过顺从来引导波伊尔对绝对真理产生质疑。他当然没有预料到神圣的火焰会突然出现，烧毁波伊尔的光环并使他的翅膀变黑。全能者不仅拒绝等待天堂的审判，甚至没有等待波伊尔将自己融入阿撒泽尔的身体。如果阿撒泽尔对波伊尔的尖叫感到比“诱惑”本身更愉悦，那也是可以预料的。毕竟，阿撒泽尔是个恶魔。

A demon who had never questioned a single Heavenly order, not even once, only to be grabbed by the Almighty and thrown down without so much as a word after Michael had finished banishing the rebels. If Azazel knew so well how to break angels it was only because he knew better than anyone how unjust and unfair Heaven was (not that anyone, in Heaven or Hell, had ever believed he’d been punished without cause).  
一个从未对任何天命产生过质疑的恶魔，甚至连一次都没有，却在米迦勒驱逐叛逆者之后，被全能者一言不发地抓住并摔落下来。如果阿撒泽尔如此擅长摧毁天使，那只是因为他比任何人都更清楚天堂是多么不公正和不公平（虽然无论在天堂还是地狱，没有人相信他是无缘无故受到惩罚的）。

Azazel had never understood why he had Fallen, so it made sense that he couldn’t figure out why Raphael hadn’t. The way Raphael ran his mouth alone should have gotten him chucked out by his ear. There was also his utter willingness to bend any rule that didn’t accomplish his goals: be it a small rule like neutral-colored clothing, or a large rule like not making arrangements with your adversary to get more work done.  
阿撒泽尔从来不明白自己为什么堕落，所以他无法理解为什么拉斐尔没有堕落。单单拉斐尔那张嘴就应该让他被人揪住耳朵赶出去。还有他完全愿意违反任何不符合自己目标的规则：无论是像中性色服装这样的小规定，还是像不与对手达成安排以完成更多工作这样的大规定。

Or going wing-to-wing with Gabriel for healing an angel who had been expressly ordered to wait alone on a godforsaken rock, an angel who wasn’t even his responsibility.  
或者与加百列并肩作战，为一个明确被命令独自等待在一个荒凉的岩石上的天使治愈，一个甚至不是他责任的天使。

Azazel _remembered_, and that was another part of the conundrum. Raphael was the only angel Azazel had ever met with a half-ounce of-- of-- Not kindness or niceness, exactly. Angels dispensed beatitudes for a living, and Raphael wasn’t much for petty courtesies.  
阿撒泽尔记得，这是谜团的另一部分。拉斐尔是阿撒泽尔曾经遇到过唯一一个有一点点——一点点——不是善良或友善，确切来说。天使们以施予福音为生，而拉斐尔并不太在乎琐碎的礼节。

Abhorrence for suffering, that was it. Raphael had taken the entire Inquisition matter quite hard, and probably would have turned himself off for the entire thing if he’d had the option. But as an archangel with a department of angels coming to him at all hours with problems and petty desires for approval, Raphael had been able to do no more than turn himself off for a few hours a day, like a human. The sharp way he’d questioned Heaven letting it all happen because stopping it wasn’t part of the Great Plan _should_ have been a one-way ticket downstairs. You couldn’t get into a fight with Gabriel every time you spoke to him and stay an angel. It made no sense.  
对于痛苦的厌恶，就是这样。拉斐尔对整个宗教裁判所的事情感到非常沮丧，如果他有选择的话，可能会完全关闭自己。但作为一个拥有一群天使随时向他寻求帮助和批准的大天使，拉斐尔只能每天关闭自己几个小时，就像一个人类一样。他对天堂为什么允许这一切发生而不阻止的质疑方式本应是一张单程票下地狱。你不能每次与加百列交谈时都与他争吵并保持天使的身份，这毫无意义。

“I thought you said we’d be inconspicuous here,” the subject of the demon’s frustrations said, walking up behind Azazel and slightly to the side. The last decade or so, Raphael had started keeping office hours for his supervisory duties that were separate from the miracle hours of his Earthside position. It had helped stem the ever-present tide of subordinates popping in and out, but it hadn’t halted it entirely. Their arrangement took careful planning and a not-insignificant amount of luck to keep from being discovered.  
“我记得你说过我们在这里会低调的。”恶魔心中的烦恼对象说道，从Azazel的身后走了过来，稍微站在一边。过去的十年左右，拉斐尔开始为他的监督职责设定办公时间，与他在地球上的奇迹时间分开。这有助于遏制下属们频繁出入的潮流，但并没有完全阻止。他们的安排需要仔细的计划和相当大的运气，才能避免被发现。

The meagre crowd for Hamlet was a problem for more than just William Shakespeare.  
《哈姆雷特》的观众稀少不仅仅是对威廉·莎士比亚而言是个问题。

“Well, that was the idea,” Azazel replied. He popped one of the hazelnuts he’d purchased earlier into his mouth. The hawker made a sales pitch to Raphael that the angel waved off.  
“嗯，那就是我的想法，”阿撒泽尔回答道。他把之前买的榛子之一塞进了嘴里。摊贩向拉斐尔推销，但被天使挥手拒绝了。

Azazel gave the angel a sideways glance. The fashion for human men had swung back to allowing long hair, and Raphael had predictably taken the opportunity to grow his out. His doublet and hose were varying shades of green. He looked lovely next to Azazel’s dress-code black, and the outfit made Raphael’s hair look like holy fire. That was, of course, why he’d selected it.  
阿撒泽尔斜眼看了一眼天使。人类男性的时尚潮流又回到了允许留长发的阶段，而拉斐尔自然也抓住机会留长了头发。他的上衣和裤子是不同的绿色。他站在阿撒泽尔身边，看起来很美，而这套装扮让拉斐尔的头发看起来像圣火一样。当然，这也是他选择这套装扮的原因。

Vanity, another reason to Fall which didn’t seem to work on Raphael. Not that Azazel was complaining. If Raphael wanted to be looked at, the demon was happy to oblige.  
虚荣，又一个导致堕落的原因，但对拉斐尔似乎没有起作用。阿撒泽尔并不抱怨。如果拉斐尔想要被人注视，这个恶魔很乐意满足他的愿望。

“This isn’t one of Shakespeare’s gloomy ones, is it?” Raphael asked. “No wonder no one’s here.”  
“这不是莎士比亚的那种忧郁剧吧？”拉斐尔问道。“难怪没人在这里。”

Master Burbage had apparently also noticed the audience consisted of five people, one of which was the playwright, and that only Shakespeare and Azazel were paying any sort of attention.  
伯贝奇大师显然也注意到观众只有五个人，其中一个是剧作家，只有莎士比亚和阿撒泽尔在认真聆听。

“I am wasting my time up here,” he declared, breaking character.  
他宣称：“我在这里浪费时间。”他打破了角色。

“No, no, you’re very good,” Azazel consoled. Part of the praise was sincere. Burbage had been a headliner since his twenties for a reason. Part was because the play couldn’t go on if the lead was having a fit. Azazel loved Hamlet. Posing as a dead father to a grieving son and fingering the uncle for murder: it was inspired as a temptation to wrath. Shakespeare was as looking at a promising future in Hell after he died.  
“不，不，你很棒。”阿撒泽尔安慰道。部分赞美是真诚的。伯贝奇从二十多岁起就成为头号演员，这是有原因的。另一部分是因为如果主角发疯了，剧本就无法继续进行。阿撒泽尔喜欢《哈姆雷特》。扮演一个死去的父亲，安慰一个悲痛的儿子，并指责叔叔谋杀：这是一种引诱愤怒的灵感。莎士比亚在死后将在地狱中迎来一个有前途的未来。

“And what does your friend think?” Burbage demanded. Shakespeare turned to see who Burbage was talking about.  
“你朋友怎么想？”伯贝奇要求道。莎士比亚转过身去看伯贝奇在谈论谁。

“He didn’t realize this wasn’t a comedy, pay him no mind,” Azazel said to Burbage, but he made eye contact with Shakespeare. Dear William could do as he liked with Earl Pembroke, but Raphael was off limits.  
“他没意识到这不是一部喜剧，别理他。”阿撒泽尔对伯贝奇说，但他与莎士比亚交换了眼神。亲爱的威廉可以随心所欲地对待彭布鲁克伯爵，但拉斐尔是禁区。

Not that Azazel had any _objection_ to Raphael Falling to lust, of course not, it just-- well he couldn’t let some mortal take that kind of achievement out of his hands. Yes, quite.  
并不是说阿撒泽尔对拉斐尔沉溺于欲望有任何异议，当然不是，只是——嗯，他不能让一些凡人夺走他这样的成就。是的，确实如此。

“Yes, Burbage,” Shakespeare said, turning back around. “Please. From the top.”  
“是的，伯贝奇，”莎士比亚转过身来说道。“请。从头开始。”

Burbage went back to his soliloquy as instructed.  
根据指示，伯贝奇回到了他的独白。

“He’s very good, isn’t he?” Azazel asked Raphael.  
“他很厉害，对吧？”阿撒泽尔问拉斐尔。

“Age does not wither, nor custom stale his infinite variety,” Raphael agreed.  
“年龄不会使他凋零，习俗也不能使他的无限多样性变得陈腐。”拉斐尔赞同地说道。

“This is my last chance to see this. I have to be in Edinburg by the end of the week,” Azazel remarked. “I have to ride a horse. Can’t tempt a clan leader into horse rustling without one.”  
“这是我最后一次看到这个的机会。我必须在本周末之前到达爱丁堡，”阿撒泽尔说道。“我必须骑马。没有马，就无法引诱一个族长去偷马。”

Raphael made a wordless sound of displeasure. “Not a fan of horses myself. Impossible to stay on, serious design flaw if you ask me.” His eyes slid toward Azazel. “I also have to be in Edinburg: minor miracle and a couple of blessings.”  
拉斐尔发出了一个无言的不满声音。“我自己不是马迷。要保持平衡简直不可能，如果你问我，这是一个严重的设计缺陷。”他的目光滑向阿撒泽尔。“我也必须去爱丁堡：小奇迹和几个祝福。”

“The flaw isn’t in the horse, it’s in your riding skills. You should ride behind someone else – you hold on to him, and he does a proper job of holding on to the horse. Pity you can’t ride behind me, my dear. They’re giving me a magnificent destrier: sable coat, flowing mane, sparks thrown from his horseshoes. Very dramatic.” Azazel spared another sideways glance at Raphael, then purred, “I’m certain a sturdy black stallion between your legs would be just the thing to change your mind.”  
“问题不在马身上，而是你的骑术有问题。你应该跟在别人后面骑，抓住他，让他来牢牢控制马匹。可惜你不能跟在我后面骑，亲爱的。他们给了我一匹华丽的战马：黑色的外套，飘逸的鬃毛，从蹄铁上溅起的火花。非常戏剧化。”阿撒泽尔再次斜眼瞥了拉斐尔一眼，然后咕噜咕噜地说道：“我敢肯定，一匹坚实的黑色种马在你的双腿之间会改变你的想法。”

Raphael made a series of sounds which Azazel had come to understand was the archangel’s mouth beginning operations before his brain formed the actual words. Color rode high on his sharp cheekbones.  
拉斐尔发出了一系列声音，阿撒泽尔已经明白，这是大天使开始发声，然后大脑才形成实际的词语。色彩在他锐利的颧骨上浮现。

“My dear boy, I meant riding pillion would change your opinion about horses. Though I’m flattered you think of me as a stallion.” Azazel feigned innocence. That was always good for winding Raphael up like a cheap but endlessly amusing toy.  
“亲爱的孩子，我是说坐在后座上会改变你对马的看法。虽然你把我当作一匹骏马，我感到受宠若惊。”阿撒泽尔装出一副无辜的样子。这总是能让拉斐尔像一个廉价但无尽有趣的玩具一样被激怒。

“Hellfire, I didn’t read anything into that sentence you didn’t fully intend and you know it.”  
“我可没在那句话里多想什么，你完全是有意的，你自己心里清楚。”

“I know no such thing. Reading your utterly un-holy licentiousness into my turn of phrase just because I’m a demon is hardly something I can be held accountable for.” Azazel held a hand to his chest as if the burden of unjust accusal was too heavy to be borne. Color was suffusing Raphael’s entire face now.  
“我一点都不知道。将你那种彻底不神圣的放荡之气强加给我的措辞，仅仅因为我是个恶魔，这根本不是我应该负责的事情。”亚撒谢尔把手放在胸前，仿佛不公正的指责压得他喘不过气来。拉斐尔的脸上现在满是愤怒。

“I can hold you accountable for whatever I damn well please,” Raphael said crossly.  
“我可以对你负责任，不管我想做什么。”拉斐尔生气地说道。

“Because you are an archangel and I am Fallen?” Azazel asked as Hamlet fretted on. There was more steel in the demon’s voice than he intended, hints of old bitterness seeping through Azazel’s control. Raphael didn’t know that, though, and relented.  
“因为你是大天使，而我是堕落天使？”阿撒泽尔问道，当哈姆雷特烦恼不已时。恶魔的声音中透露出比他本意更多的坚决，一丝丝旧日的苦涩渗透出阿撒泽尔的控制之中。然而，拉斐尔并不知道这一点，于是他放松了下来。

“You know I didn’t mean it like that, hellfire.”  
你知道我不是那个意思，见鬼。

“No, you didn’t,” Azazel said, forcing his voice to be airy and gentle because he actually didn’t want Raphael to start asking any questions which could lead to having to discuss Poyel. “I was only needling you, my dear. You do blush so prettily.” The compliment made Raphael drop his eyes and look away. “I assume given that it is quarter’s end, you want to toss for one of us doing both at Edinburg?”  
“不，你没有，”阿撒泽尔说道，他强迫自己的声音轻快而温柔，因为他实际上并不想让拉斐尔开始问任何可能导致讨论波伊尔的问题。“我只是在逗你玩，亲爱的。你脸红得如此可爱。”这个赞美让拉斐尔垂下了眼睛，移开了目光。“我猜想，考虑到这是季末，你想要我们中的一个人去爱丁堡同时完成两个任务？”

“It’s a waste of effort for both of us to take the trip just for a zero sum.”  
我们两个人为了一个零和游戏而旅行，实在是徒劳无功。

“You know, dear boy, I’ve noticed that when you do the tempting there’s always some sort of domino effect afterward: exposing a corrupt official, a work position opening up for a widow, expensive herbs just happening to find their way to some hedge witch.” Azazel looked at Raphael steadily. “Isn’t that strange?”  
“你知道吗，亲爱的孩子，我注意到每当你进行诱惑时，总会随之发生某种多米诺效应：揭露一个腐败官员，为寡妇提供一个工作机会，昂贵的草药偶然间找到某个草药女巫。”阿撒泽尔目不转睛地看着拉斐尔。“这不奇怪吗？”

“Angel,” Raphael said, gesturing down his body. Azazel followed the gesture with his eyes.  
“天使，”拉斐尔说着，手势指向自己的身体。阿撒泽尔跟随着他的手势，目光移向下方。

“Mmm,” Azazel said. “And you wouldn’t be using doing my temptings for me as a cover for some off-the-books good works Heaven doesn’t approve of?”  
“嗯，”阿撒泽尔说道。“你不会是以为帮我引诱人类只是为了掩盖一些天堂不认可的私下善行吧？”

“Of course not.” Raphael still wasn’t meeting Azazel’s eyes. If Raphael Fell, he’d learn to be a more shameless liar.  
“当然不是。”拉斐尔仍然不敢直视阿撒泽尔的眼睛。如果拉斐尔堕落了，他会学会更加无耻地撒谎。

“My dear, it’s subverting Heaven. I’m not going to be upset,” Azazel said aloud. Recommending Falling to improve Raphael’s mendacity would wind him up, but not in the fun way. It would be in the way that led to Raphael avoiding him for fifty years. The demon pulled out a coin.  
“亲爱的，这是在颠覆天意。我不会生气的，”阿撒泽尔大声说道。推荐堕落来改善拉斐尔的虚伪行为会让他生气，但不是一种有趣的方式。这会导致拉斐尔在接下来的五十年里避开他。恶魔掏出一枚硬币。

“Heads.” Raphael called the coin even before Azazel flipped it. Heads.  
“正面。”拉斐尔在阿撒泽尔抛硬币之前就喊出了。正面。

“I guess I’m going to Edinburg,” Azazel sighed. There was no way Hamlet would still be showing by the time he got back.  
“我猜我要去爱丁堡了。”阿撒泽尔叹了口气。他回来的时候，哈姆雷特肯定已经不在上映了。

“This play is a complete dud,” Shakespeare was complaining to an individual Azazel didn’t recognize. “It’d take a miracle to get anyone to come and see it.”  
“这个剧完全是个失败作品，”莎士比亚向一个阿撒泽尔不认识的人抱怨道。“要想有人来看它，简直需要奇迹。”

Unless-- 除非--

Azazel looked at Raphael beseechingly. Raphael was remarkably circumspect with frivolous miracles, something about setting a good example for his staff. Surely he had a “freebie” or two-- Azazel had range but not Edinburg-to-London range, and Raphael would be in London reviewing his quarterlies--  
阿撒泽尔恳切地看着拉斐尔。拉斐尔对于轻浮的奇迹非常谨慎，似乎是为了给他的员工树立一个好榜样。他肯定有一两个"免费赠品"——阿撒泽尔的能力有限，无法像从爱丁堡到伦敦那样远，而拉斐尔将在伦敦审查他的季度报告——

“Yes, alright, I’ll do that one. My treat,” Raphael capitulated. “I still prefer the funny ones.”  
"好的，没问题，我来做那个。我请客，" Raphael屈服了。“我还是更喜欢搞笑的。”

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Looking at the fake Raphael and the nightmare-which-could-have-been Aziraphale made it feel like the inside of Crowley’s corporation had been replaced with shattered glass. The tempered little pieces were grinding against each other and slicing him to ribbons.  
看着假拉斐尔和本可以成为噩梦的阿齐拉费尔，就像克劳利的公司内部被破碎的玻璃所取代一样。这些经过调整的小碎片相互摩擦，将他切割成了碎片。

He knew Heaven would never forgive him. Lucifer had seemed to understand Crowley’s frustration with how Gabriel ran Heaven – how cold, how stark everything was. How disposable Gabriel considered the lower choirs. (Not that he’d ever admit to Aziraphale even under pain of torture that that had been one of his questions.) But Lucifer had thought the solution was to oust God and put himself in God’s place. Crowley hadn’t fought for Lucifer’s ego, but the taint of questions and questionable association had been enough to damn him.  
他知道天堂永远不会原谅他。路西法似乎理解克劳利对加百列管理天堂的不满 - 天堂的冷漠、一切的冷酷无情。加百列对下属合唱团的看法是可有可无的。（虽然他在受到酷刑的威胁下也不会向亚齐拉费尔承认这是他的一个问题。）但路西法认为解决办法是推翻上帝，取而代之。克劳利并不为了路西法的自负而战斗，但问题和可疑的关联已足以让他堕入地狱。

Not raising his staff against Heaven had condemned him in Hell to being the lowest-ranked of the damned. Crowley didn’t have the cruelty it took to climb the corporate ladder in Hell, as the humans would say, so there he’d stayed.  
不敢对天发起挑战，使他在地狱成为最低级的罪人。克劳利没有地狱里攀爬企业阶梯所需的残忍心性，就这样他一直待在那里。

He’d never fit anywhere he’d been except with Aziraphale.  
他在任何地方都找不到归属感，除了与阿齐拉费尔在一起。

Crowley never would have forgiven himself if he’d been wrong about the Ineffable Plan, if he had saved the world at the price of damning his angel.  
如果克劳利对于那个无法言喻的计划判断错误，如果他以牺牲天使的代价拯救了世界，他将永远无法原谅自己。

He tried to say Aziraphale’s name. It stuck in his throat, Unspeakable. An illusion couldn’t be Unspeakable. But at the same time, the monster in front of him couldn’t be Aziraphale because Aziraphale was next to him, his holy light glowing in the air above them all.  
他试图说出阿齐拉费尔的名字。它卡在他的喉咙里，无法言说。一个幻象不可能无法言说。但与此同时，他面前的怪物不可能是阿齐拉费尔，因为阿齐拉费尔就在他身边，他神圣的光芒在他们所有人的头顶上闪耀。

“Creating reversed illusions isn’t one of our signs of the Apocalypse, no,” the Fallen whatever-it-was said. “Technically the Antichrist has the power to create doubles, but I don’t see why he would. We don’t even know who he is.”  
“制造倒置幻象并不是我们末日的征兆之一，不是的，”那个堕落的某物说道。“从技术上讲，反基督拥有创造分身的能力，但我不明白他为什么要这么做。我们甚至不知道他是谁。”

“What do you mean?” Aziraphale demanded. “Whatever you are, the Apocalypse is over. Well, averted anyway.”  
“你是什么意思？”阿齐拉费尔要求道。“无论你是什么，末日已经结束了。嗯，至少是被避免了。”

The false Raphael paled. He reached his hand out to brace himself on the car.  
伪拉斐尔变得苍白。他伸出手扶住车子。

“Well. It isn’t as if we hadn’t considered the possibility,” the fake Aziraphale said softly, lowering his eyes briefly. “I’m uncertain as to why I would be redeemed while you Fall.”  
“嗯，我们并不是没有考虑过这种可能性。”假阿齐拉费尔轻声说道，短暂地低下了眼睛。“我不确定为什么我会被救赎而你却堕落。”

“We’re-- we’re--” It took three tries for Crowley to get his voice to have any volume. “We’re not from the future.” Aziraphale’s bookshop had been operational for two hundred years. Going back seven months wouldn’t make it a charity shop, and there wouldn’t be snow on the ground. Were they in the future? Armageddon 2.0, with some strange reversal of fortunes between now and then? “It’s December 19, 2019 for us.”  
“我们——我们——”克劳利尝试了三次才能发出有声音的声音。“我们不是来自未来。”亚齐拉费尔的书店已经运营了两百年。回到七个月前并不会让它变成一家慈善商店，地上也不会有雪。他们是在未来吗？末日2.0，现在和那时之间发生了一些奇怪的命运逆转吗？“对我们来说，现在是2019年12月19日。”

How could a demon be forgiven?  
一个恶魔怎么可能被原谅呢？

There were so many ways Aziraphale could Fall.  
亚齐拉费尔有很多种堕落的方式。

“Same date,” the fake Aziraphale said. He looked at the fake Raphael for an explanation. The false Aziraphale apparently shared the real Aziraphale’s distaste for both podcasts and science in general. Adam creating an illusion was looking less likely. Adam just didn’t know Aziraphale well enough for that level of verisimilitude.  
“同一天，”假的阿齐拉费尔说道。他看着假的拉斐尔，希望他解释一下。假的阿齐拉费尔显然和真正的阿齐拉费尔一样，对播客和科学都不感兴趣。亚当创造幻象的可能性似乎越来越小了。亚当并不太了解阿齐拉费尔，无法达到那种逼真的程度。

The false Raphael flapped his lips, shaking his head. “Calabi-Yau dimensions aren’t permeable. It would take all four archangels in the presence of the galactic core to send one angel or demon back in time. Even if they did, somehow, pull off two, the main timeline and everyone in it would have been erased, not sitting here gaping at us.” The fake Raphael – though it was looking like he was Raphael as genuinely as Crowley wasn’t – grimaced. “You said the Antichrist could bend reality. He must have-- mucked with time somehow. Changed the rules, or-- something.”  
假的拉斐尔嘴唇颤动着，摇了摇头。“卡拉比-尤维度是不可渗透的。要将一个天使或恶魔送回时间，需要四位大天使在银河核心的存在。即使他们以某种方式成功了两次，主时间线和其中的所有人都将被抹去，而不是坐在这里目瞪口呆地看着我们。”虽然这个假的拉斐尔看起来像是真正的拉斐尔，就像克劳利一样，但他皱了皱眉。“你说反基督可以扭曲现实。他一定以某种方式搞乱了时间。改变了规则，或者是其他什么。”

“That was our theory as well,” Aziraphale said politely. “We were headed to see him when, well, we had thought you’d stolen Crowley’s car.”  
“这也是我们的理论，”亚齐拉费尔礼貌地说道。“我们正要去找他，可是，唔，我们以为你偷了克劳利的车。”

Raphael turned his head to stare at Crowley. Crowley waved back lamely. The initial shock was fading into surreality. Was this what humans felt when they took drugs? Why in Satan’s name did they do it twice?  
拉斐尔转过头盯着克劳利。克劳利无力地挥手回应。最初的震惊逐渐变得超现实。这就是人类在吸毒时的感觉吗？为什么他们要做两次呢？该死，这是为什么？

“Raphael J. Crowley is what I put my flat lease under.”  
“Raphael J. Crowley 是我在租赁合同上填写的名字。”

“Anthony J. Crowley, same. J just a J?” When Raphael nodded, Crowley announced he needed to sit down and helped himself to the back seat of the Bentley. His head was spinning, and not just from being low on power.  
安东尼·J·克劳利，一样。J只是一个J吗？拉斐尔点了点头，克劳利宣布他需要坐下来，并自己坐进了宾利的后座。他的头晕得厉害，不仅仅是因为能量不足。

“So you’re Crawly, then?” Aziraphale asked his Fallen counterpart.  
“那么你就是克劳利，对吗？”亚齐拉费尔问他堕落的对手。

“Why in Satan’s name--? _Azazel._” It was as bad as A. Z. Fell. God-- Satan-- Somebody, the angel really never changed.  
“为什么见鬼的名字——？阿撒泽尔。” 这简直糟糕透顶，就像A. Z. 费尔一样。天啊——撒旦——不管是谁，这个天使真的从来没有改变过。

“Oh. Well, ah, nice to meet you then, Azazel.” Aziraphale’s courtesy was unflappable. Crowley felt the Bentley shift as Aziraphale repaired the tire he’d blown. “I don’t suppose you’d mind giving us a lift?”  
"哦，嗯，那么很高兴认识你，阿撒泽尔先生。”亚齐拉费尔的礼貌始终如一。克劳利感觉到宾利车在阿齐拉费尔修理他爆胎的时候有所移动。“我想你不介意搭我们一程吧？”

“To the Antichrist?” Azazel’s voice lilted in ways Aziraphale’s didn’t. “No, not at all, just point the way. We can solve this problem and Armageddon with one broken neck.”  
“给反基督？”阿撒泽尔的声音有着阿齐拉费尔所没有的抑扬顿挫。“不，一点也不，只是指个方向。我们可以解决这个问题，用一根断了的脖子来结束末日。”

“You can’t just up and kill him! Hell’s sake, did you take demon lessons from Hastur?” Crowley snapped, not that Azazel would be able to understand more than the gist. Raphael and Aziraphale had started talking at the exact same time Crowley had.  
“你不能随便就杀了他！见鬼，你是从哈斯特那里学的恶魔课吗？”克劳利厉声说道，尽管阿撒泽尔可能只能理解大概意思。拉斐尔和阿齐拉费尔在克劳利开口的同时开始交谈。

“I expected that from them,” Azazel replied when the 2.1 stereo of complaint had stilled, looking down through the car window at Crowley. “But you are aware that you are a demon, yes?”  
“我对他们的期望就是这样的，”阿撒泽尔在2.1声道的抱怨平息后回答道，透过车窗望着克劳利说道。“但你意识到你是个恶魔，对吗？”

“You are aware you are extremely annoying, yes?” Crowley grimaced internally. It wasn’t his best.  
“你知道你非常讨人厌，对吗？”克劳利内心不禁扭曲了一下。这不是他最好的表现。

Azazel raised an eyebrow just like Aziraphale did when he was disappointed.  
阿撒泽尔抬起了一只眉毛，就像阿齐拉费尔在失望时所做的一样。

“Adam has been raised completely human,” Aziraphale pleaded in that way that usually convinced Crowley to do whatever he wanted. They’d see if it worked on any demon. “He will stop Armageddon as soon as he sees what it will do to his friends, and whatever he’s done to cause this wasn’t intentional. He’ll fix it when we ask. I give you my word.”  
“亚当完全是以人类的方式成长起来的，”亚齐拉费尔恳求道，以往这种方式通常能说服克劳利做任何他想做的事情。他们可以试试看这个方法对任何恶魔是否奏效。“一旦他看到末日审判对他的朋友们会造成什么样的后果，他就会停止它，而且他所做的一切都不是有意为之。只要我们开口，他会修复这一切。我向你保证。”

“It’s at least worth a try, hellfire,” Raphael chimed in.  
“至少值得一试，该死的，”拉斐尔插话道。

“Fine,” Azazel sighed. “We will give it a go. But if he doesn’t snap to, I’m killing him and the rest of you are staying out of my way.” Azazel dropped into the passenger seat.  
“好吧，”阿撒泽尔叹了口气。“我们试试看。但是如果他不乖乖听话，我就杀了他，你们其他人都别挡我。”阿撒泽尔坐进了副驾驶座位。

“You’re not getting into my car covered in that,” Raphael said. He snapped his fingers and the mud and snow disappeared from Aziraphale’s clothes. The angels clicked off their holy lights and joined the demons in the Bentley. Crowley leaned back in the seat. He could feel a vague prickle of hellfire in his gut, but still not enough to be worth a damn.  
“你穿着那样的衣服别想进我的车。”拉斐尔说道。他用手指一弹，阿齐拉费尔身上的泥土和雪花瞬间消失。天使们关闭了他们的神圣之光，加入了恶魔们坐在宾利车里。克劳利舒舒服服地靠在座位上。他能感觉到一丝丝地狱之火在他的肚子里，但还远远不够值一提。

Worst six-month anniversary of all time.  
有史以来最糟糕的六个月纪念日。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Jean-Claude was regaling the dining hall with how he’d helped catch the Scarlet Pimpernel in the act of smuggling aristocrat children in wine barrels. Azazel came for the food, not the company, so he mostly ignored the sans-culottes and their kind. It wasn’t as if he spoke much French. The chatter wasn’t a particularly pleasant background music, but the crepes were truly excellent. Colette did amazing things with the batter. The texture was always flawless.  
让餐厅里的人听得津津有味的是让-克洛德讲述他是如何在行动中抓住了红衣小田纳西，他们将贵族子女藏在酒桶里走私。阿撒泽尔来这里是为了食物，而不是为了交际，所以他大多数时间都忽略了无裤子派和他们的同类。他又不怎么会说法语。这些闲聊并不是特别愉快的背景音乐，但是可丽饼真的非常棒。科莱特用面糊做出了令人惊叹的事情。质地总是无可挑剔的。

“--cheveux roux.” “--红发。”

Azazel didn’t speak much French, but he did know “red hair.” He could hear various forms of “appeler.” If they were saying the Scarlet Pimpernel was named for the color of his hair--  
阿撒谢尔不太会说法语，但他知道“红头发”。他听到了各种形式的“appeler”。如果他们是在说猩红报春花是因为他的头发颜色而得名的-

Kids in peril, red hair, and the Pimpernel was said to be smarter and stronger than the average human. The demon had a fairly good idea of what he was going to find in the Bastille. Azazel wiped his mouth and left his crepes on the table. Azazel’s plain, dark clothing and short, unpowdered hair looked the part of a revolutionary. Combined with his powers of suggestion, getting into the Bastille was no trouble at all.  
孩子们处于危险之中，红发，据说比普通人更聪明、更强壮的是“红花侠”。恶魔对巴士底狱里会发现什么有相当清楚的想法。阿撒泽尔擦了擦嘴，把他的可丽饼留在桌子上。阿撒泽尔朴素的黑色衣服和短发，看起来像一个革命者。再加上他的暗示能力，进入巴士底狱毫不费力。

The stink of urine, feces, rotting straw, and blood was galling as Azazel walked down the winding stairs past the cell blocks. Aristocrats cried out for mercy. Azazel paid them as much mind as they had paid the poor. He didn’t agree with the Directoire methods, per se. Women and children didn’t have any substantiative say in political decisions, even if they did benefit from them, so wiping out entire families root and stem was a little much. Heaven and the First Estate were similar enough in _modus operandi_, however, that Azazel understood the revolutionary _sentiment_ quite well.  
阿撒泽尔走过蜿蜒的楼梯，经过囚室区域时，尿液、粪便、腐烂的稻草和血液的恶臭令人难以忍受。贵族们哀求着饶命，但阿撒泽尔对他们的请求毫不理会，就像他们对穷人所付出的一样。他并不完全赞同执政府的手段。妇女和儿童在政治决策中没有实质性的发言权，即使他们从中受益，所以彻底消灭整个家族有些过分。然而，天堂和第一等级的运作方式相似，因此阿撒泽尔对革命情绪非常理解。

Raphael was pacing in his cell, his long fingers worrying the links of the chain that bound him to the wall. He was dressed as a peasant. His trousers had old stains from wine spatter, but his jacket didn’t have stains from spills – a wine merchant, not a drunk. Raphael’s hair was cropped painfully short to make it easier to wear wigs for his various disguises. His attention to detail was magnificent, so it must have been the actions of the children – an ill-timed cry, a sniffle – that tipped Jean-Claude off. There was a guard on either side of the door. Raphael’s was the only occupied cell on the floor, doubtless to ensure any allies who may have deliberately gotten themselves captured could not get close enough to assist in a rescue.  
拉斐尔在牢房里来回踱步，他修长的手指不停地担心着将他绑在墙上的链条。他穿着农民的服装，裤子上有旧的酒渍，但他的夹克上没有溅洒的污渍——他是个酒商，而不是个酒鬼。拉斐尔的头发被剪得非常短，以便更容易戴上假发进行各种伪装。他对细节的关注是令人惊叹的，所以一定是孩子们的行动——一个不合时宜的哭声，一个抽鼻子的声音——让让-克洛德起了疑心。门口的两侧各有一名卫兵。拉斐尔是这一层唯一被关押的囚犯，无疑是为了确保任何可能故意让自己被捕的盟友无法靠近足够近来协助营救。

“Give me a minute with the prisoner, lads,” Azazel said. Suggestion didn’t require a language in common, so he didn’t bother with French. There was a faint smell of sulphur in the air as the guards stiffened, then began walking up the stairs to the next level.  
“伙计们，给我和囚犯待会儿。”阿撒泽尔说道。建议不需要共同的语言，所以他没有费心用法语。空气中弥漫着一股淡淡的硫磺味，看到这情景，卫兵们变得紧张起来，然后开始往楼上走去。

“So I have you to thank for this… slaughterhouse,” Raphael accused, turning to face the demon. He didn’t magic the chains away with the guards out of sight, which silently confirmed Azazel’s other theory.  
“所以我要感谢你…这个屠宰场，”拉斐尔指责道，转身面对恶魔。他没有在看不见守卫的情况下解开锁链，这无声地证实了阿撒泽尔的另一个理论。

“No, humanity came up with this themselves. But I have white in my ledger from _someone_ racking up a fat score of ‘accidental’ good in my name, so I’m taking the commendation and thanking Hell for it. You, on the other hand, haven’t used a single miracle for this entire production.” Azazel knew the answer, but with an archangel utterly at his mercy no one could blame him for making Raphael admit it aloud. If they could, Azazel didn’t care.  
“不，这是人类自己想出来的。但是有人以我的名义积累了一大堆‘意外’的善行，所以我接受了表彰，并感谢地狱。而你，却没有为整个计划使用过一次奇迹。”亚撒泽知道答案，但他对于让拉斐尔公开承认并不怀疑。如果他们能够，亚撒泽也不在乎。

“I am supposed to be using my position to guide humanity into siding with Heaven, not policing their petty squabbles.” Raphael’s voice was bitter and his long fingers were still worrying the chain. “So yes, whether I free myself with a miracle or get discorporated in the morning, the end result is the same: a long drop and a sudden stop. Happy?”  
“我本应该利用我的职位引导人类站在天堂一边，而不是监管他们的琐碎争吵。” 拉斐尔的声音带着苦涩，他的长手指仍在担心着那条链子。“所以是的，无论我是否用奇迹解脱自己，或者明天早上解体，最终结果都是一样的：一个长长的下落和突然的停止。满意吗？”

Azazel knew he should be. The archangel Raphael Fallen, hadn’t that been the goal he’d set himself during that first meeting? As a demon, as a representative of Hell, he should absolutely let Raphael’s recklessness do his job for him.  
阿撒谢尔知道他应该这样做。堕落的大天使拉斐尔，那不就是他在第一次会面时设定的目标吗？作为一个恶魔，作为地狱的代表，他绝对应该让拉斐尔的鲁莽行为为他完成工作。

Raphael didn’t have the cruelty it took to get any sort of rank in Hell. As a demon, Raphael would be able to do as he liked, when he liked, without the responsibility of his department hanging over him all the time. And throwing Raphael down for rescuing children was wrong. Anyone but Heaven could see that. Wouldn’t it be better for Raphael to see Heaven for what it was?  

But-- 但是--

The thing was-- 事情是这样的--

With Raphael Falling being less abstract and more concrete--  
随着拉斐尔·福林的作品变得越来越具体而不再抽象--

There was simply no way to pretend--  
根本没有办法假装--

Raphael would never be happy in Hell. In his precious free time he was always going to this concert or that garden party, wherever the people were. Whatever was the “in” thing. He chatted with old ladies at the park, pretty young men who didn’t realize Raphael wasn’t human, his precious subordinates, even his adversary. Raphael’s smiles were soft and warm and frequent, crow’s feet crinkling at the corners of his eyes.  
拉斐尔永远不会在地狱里感到快乐。在他宝贵的空闲时间里，他总是去参加这场音乐会或那个花园派对，无论人们在哪里。无论什么是“时髦”的东西。他在公园里与老太太聊天，与不知道拉斐尔不是人类的年轻帅哥聊天，与他珍贵的下属聊天，甚至与他的对手聊天。拉斐尔的微笑温柔而温暖，频繁地在他眼角的鱼尾纹处绽放。

Hell was cold, hellfire or no. Raphael would learn to ration his smiles in Hell. He would learn to be circumspect with his affection and to pretend to a cruelty he didn’t have to save his own skin. Azazel had. He wouldn’t even have to watch Raphael be unhappy, because Raphael would be in Hell and Azazel would still be up here.  
地狱是冷的，无论是否有地狱之火。拉斐尔将学会在地狱中节制微笑。他将学会谨慎对待自己的感情，并假装残忍以保全自己的性命。阿撒泽尔已经这样做了。他甚至不需要看着拉斐尔不开心，因为拉斐尔将在地狱中，而阿撒泽尔仍将在这里。

Azazel snapped his fingers, the door lock springing open.  
阿撒谢尔咔嗒一声，门锁弹开了。

“If anyone asks, you somehow pulled this off on your own.” Azazel used his prim, condescending voice. He could not be seen being-- emotional, over an angel. It was bad enough he was rescuing one, directly betraying Hell’s best interests.  
“如果有人问起，你得以某种方式独自完成了这件事。”阿撒泽尔用他那傲慢而冷峻的声音说道。他不能让别人看到他对一个天使有情感，这已经足够糟糕了，因为他正在直接背叛地狱的最大利益，去拯救一个天使。

“Won’t you get in trouble for this?”  
"你这样做不会惹上麻烦吗？"

“Did I not specify that, if asked, you are to concoct some sort of dashing, heroic story for how you managed on your own?” Azazel demanded, entering the cell. Another snap of his fingers and the chains fell away from Raphael’s wrists.  
“我难道没有明确说过，如果有人问起，你要编造一个令人振奋、英勇的故事，解释你是如何独自应对的？”阿撒泽尔进入牢房，要求道。他再次用手指一弹，拉斐尔的手腕上的铁链瞬间脱落。

“Dashing, heroic stories aren’t really my area, hellfire,” Raphael said, rubbing his wrists. “But I’m sure the Pimpernel will fill one in and take the credit.”  
“冲动、英勇的故事并不是我的专长，见鬼，”拉斐尔揉着手腕说道。“但我相信那个神秘人会编一个故事并且把功劳揽过来。”

That brought Azazel up short.  
这让阿撒泽尔停下了脚步。

“So there is an actual human--?”  
"所以确实有一个真正的人类吗？"

“-- I don’t know why you are surprised. I do what I do under your name all the time,” Raphael stated. “And it benefits him as well to have _a_ Pimpernel operating when he’s been seen by multiple witnesses in England.”  
“-- 我不知道你为什么感到惊讶。我一直都是以你的名义行事，”拉斐尔说道。“而且对他来说，当他在英国被多个证人看到时，有一个红花骑士行动也是有好处的。”

Son of Satan. “And when Heaven asked, you just-- pointed them at this English fellow.”  
撒旦之子。“当天堂询问时，你只是——指向了这个英国人。”

“And no angel, much less an archangel, would ever work _for_ a, a– what did Poyel call them?”  
“而且没有天使，更不用说大天使，会为一个，一个——波伊尔称之为什么来着？”

“‘Hairless apes,’” Azazel supplied.  
“‘没有毛的猿类，’”阿撒泽尔提供道。

“That’s it,” Raphael said. “No angel, much less an archangel, would ever work for a ‘hairless ape,’ so the agent he has carrying out the other rescues must be human. It’s very clever, if I do say so myself.”  
“就是这样，”拉斐尔说道。“没有天使，更不用说大天使，会为一个‘无毛猿’工作，所以他负责其他救援行动的代理人一定是人类。如果我自己说的话，这真是非常聪明。”

It was very clever. Somewhere in the last hundred years Raphael had put diligent effort into his mendacity.  
这真是太聪明了。在过去的一百年里，拉斐尔在他的虚伪上付出了勤奋的努力。

“And the Pimpernel, of course,” Azazel theorized, “thinks you’re just a like-minded British patriot. Even if they go looking in his head, there’s nothing to see but a human in glasses and a different hair color.”  
“当然，还有那个洋红花，”阿撒泽尔推测道，“认为你只是一个志同道合的英国爱国者。即使他们搜查他的脑海，也只会看到一个戴眼镜、头发颜色不同的人类。”

“And a different gender,” Raphael said, in a low voice with a conspiratorial smile. “Human gender is more performative than structural, it’s not too difficult flip over without miracling your corporation. Not that Heaven has any reason or way to know that.”  
“而且还是不同的性别，”拉斐尔低声说道，带着一丝密谋的微笑。“人类的性别更多是表演性的，而非结构性的，没有太大难度就能在不神迹般改变你的身份的情况下转变。当然，天堂没有任何理由或方法知道这一点。”

Son of _Satan_. Raphael wasn’t just defying Heaven, he was covering his tracks and then covering covering his tracks-- It was a lie worthy of the Father of the Lie himself.  
撒旦之子。拉斐尔不仅仅是在违抗天堂，他还在掩盖自己的行踪，然后又不断掩盖掩盖自己的行踪——这是一个堪比谎言之父的谎言。

“How are you not Fallen already?” He realized only after the words left his mouth that Raphael was not like to take it as a compliment.  
你怎么还没倒下呢？他说出这句话后才意识到，拉斐尔可能不会把它当作一句赞美的话。

“Because Gabriel doesn’t know and the Almighty doesn’t mind,” Raphael said, flushing from Azazel’s approval. “Now, while we’re here, I need to ask you for a favor.”  
“因为加百列不知道，而全能者也不在意。”拉斐尔说着，因为阿撒泽尔的赞同而脸红了起来。“现在，我们在这里的时候，我需要向你求个 favor。”

Azazel was brought up short for the second time. “A favor. In the middle of a rescue. Without so much as a word of thanks, I might add--”  
亚撒谢尔第二次被打断了。“一个请求。在救援中。甚至没有一句感谢的话，我要补充一下——”

“--Thank you.” Raphael hastily parroted the petty courtesy. Azazel realized what favor the archangel would need to ask for “while they were here” in the Bastille.  
“--谢谢。”拉斐尔匆忙地模仿了这种微不足道的礼貌。阿撒泽尔意识到大天使将会在巴士底狱“待在这里”的时候需要什么帮助。

“No! No, no, no, no. Out of the question. Do you know what Hell would do to me for rescuing twenty human children from execution? How could I _possibly_ justify that?”  
“不行！不行，不行，不行。这是不可能的。你知道地狱会对我做什么，因为我救了二十个人类孩子免于处决吗？我怎么可能为此辩解？”

“It’s closer to seventy-four in the Bastille, depending on where you stand on the sixteen-versus-eighteen majority question--” Raphael corrected.  
“根据你对十六岁和十八岁成年的问题持何种立场，巴士底狱的年龄可能更接近七十四岁。”拉斐尔纠正道。

“And that makes it _better_?” Azazel was trying to speak softly and scream at the same time.  
“这样就更好了？”阿撒泽尔试图轻声说话，同时又想尖叫出来。

“More believable,” Raphael’s voice was urgent, soft. He stepped closer to Azazel. “As a Temptation.”  
“更有说服力。”拉斐尔的声音紧迫而柔和。他走近阿撒泽尔。“作为一种诱惑。”

“What the _Heaven_ kind of temptation would involve saving seventy-plus human children from getting their heads chopped off?”  
“到底是什么样的诱惑，会让人去拯救七十多个孩子免于被砍头？”

“Say you extorted me,” Raphael answered quickly. “For a-- a favor.” The archangel’s brief hesitation made it clear what kind of favor he was suggesting.  
“假设你勒索了我，”拉斐尔迅速回答道。“为了一件……一件事情。”大天使稍稍犹豫了一下，显然表明了他所暗示的事情的性质。

It took Azazel’s brain several seconds to come up with words to send to his mouth. Unlike Raphael, though, Azazel was silent during the delay.  
阿撒泽尔的大脑花了几秒钟才想出要说的话。不过，与拉斐尔不同的是，在这段延迟期间，阿撒泽尔保持沉默。

“Are you _trying_ to Fall?” Azazel demanded. He tried for anger but ended up somewhere around panic.  
“你是在试图摔倒吗？”阿撒谢尔质问道。他试图表现出愤怒，但最终陷入了恐慌的状态。

“I won’t.” Raphael’s voice was certain. “Exchanging a _favor_ for the lives of others is an act of self-sacrifice, not lust. The Almighty won’t mind and Gabriel doesn’t have to know. It won’t make for the fourth Fallen angel in your repertoire, but blackmailing an archangel into bed is still a significant demonic achievement.” Raphael’s entire face was red, and his nervous stammering undercut what would have otherwise been a somewhat suave seduction. “You look at me, and, and you insinuate-- all the time. You can have what you want, no consequences, just this once.”  
“我不会。”拉斐尔的声音坚定无疑。“以他人的生命来交换一个恩惠是一种自我牺牲的行为，而不是欲望。全能者不会介意，加百列也不必知道。这不会成为你收藏的第四个堕落天使，但是勒索一位大天使上床仍然是一个重要的恶魔成就。”拉斐尔整个脸都红了，他紧张地结结巴巴的话语削弱了本来可能有些优雅的诱惑。“你看着我，然后，然后你暗示——一直都是。你可以得到你想要的，没有后果，就只有这一次。”

The Pimpernel. That blasted Englishman must have-- must have taught Raphael this, corrupted him somehow. Azazel didn’t know who he was, but he was going to kill him. Raphael hadn’t learned a damn thing from getting captured, and now he was banking everything on the Almighty’s non-existent mercy.  
那个该死的英国人一定是教了拉斐尔这个，以某种方式腐化了他。阿撒兹尔不知道他是谁，但他要杀了他。拉斐尔从被捕中一无所获，现在他把一切都寄托在上帝不存在的怜悯上。

Azazel was built to create temptations, not to resist them from an archangel Hell-bent on, well, being Hell-bent. One miracle and he could take Raphael away from the prison, have a nice crepe lunch, and then retire to Azazel’s flat. There, alone, he could-- He could do everything he’d ever fantasized about, and Raphael would let him.  
阿撒泽尔的目的是制造诱惑，而不是抵制来自一个决心要成为地狱使者的大天使的诱惑。只要有一个奇迹，他就可以把拉斐尔从监狱中带走，享受一顿美味的可丽饼午餐，然后退到阿撒泽尔的公寓。在那里，他可以独自一人，可以做他一直幻想的一切，而拉斐尔会任由他。

Raphael’s hands were on the demon’s forearms, lifting them up to--  
拉斐尔的手放在恶魔的前臂上，抬起它们，准备……

\--to put Azazel’s hands on his body. Azazel couldn’t trust himself with what he’d do with the archangel’s ribs under his hands. He shoved Raphael away roughly. His words were condescending and cruel, intended to provoke:  
\--将阿撒泽尔的手放在他的身上。阿撒泽尔不敢相信自己会对手中的大天使的肋骨做出什么事情。他粗暴地推开拉斐尔。他的话带着傲慢和残忍，意在挑衅。

“You’re the most expensive whore in Paris.”  
你是巴黎最贵的妓女。

They worked. Raphael didn’t seem to feel the need to try to keep his voice down while shouting. “Damn it all to Hell, hellfire, I am not sitting on my hands through another Inquisition. We’ve been friends for twelve hundred years. Help me! Please!”  
他们工作了。拉斐尔似乎没有感觉到需要压低声音大喊的必要。“该死的，该死的，我不会再坐视不管受到另一次审判。我们已经是朋友有一千两百年了。帮帮我！拜托！”

Azazel had never questioned Heaven’s dictates, never disobeyed, not even once, and still the Almighty had decided one day that he wasn’t worthy of Heaven or even an explanation. Everyone had concluded Azazel must have done something unfathomably evil in secret to warrant a personal expulsion from Heaven by the Almighty. Demons shunned him from fear (and respect, but fear). Angels usually seemed to share Poyel’s opinion.  
阿撒泽尔从未质疑天堂的命令，从未违抗过，甚至一次都没有，然而全能者却在某一天决定他不配拥有天堂，甚至不给他一个解释。每个人都得出结论，阿撒泽尔一定在秘密中做了一些难以理解的邪恶之事，以至于全能者亲自将他驱逐出天堂。恶魔因为害怕（和尊敬，但更多是害怕）而避开他。天使们通常似乎与波伊尔持有相同的观点。

The twin suppositions of Raphael’s request – that Azazel was a friend and that he was the kind of friend to ask for help – felt like being run through by Michael’s lance and Gabriel’s halberd all at once.  
拉斐尔的请求有两个前提假设——阿撒泽尔是一个朋友，而且他是那种可以寻求帮助的朋友——这感觉就像被迈克尔的长矛和加百列的战斧同时刺穿一样。

“Very well,” Azazel said, his voice so much softer than he wanted it to be. “Just-- buy me lunch.” Raphael’s smile was radiant. His hands fluttered in a useless, vague gesture, wanting to do something to show his happiness but not knowing what that possibly could be. “But if anyone asks,” Azazel instructed firmly, “I told you how it was going to be and then put you in your place.” Azazel had no illusions that the Almighty would draw a distinction between coercion and passion, but it was a passable enough lie.  
“很好，”阿撒泽尔说道，他的声音比他想要的要柔和得多。“只是——请我吃午餐。”拉斐尔的笑容灿烂。他的手无助地飘动着，想要做些什么来表达他的幸福，但却不知道可能是什么。“但如果有人问起，”阿撒泽尔坚定地指示道，“我告诉你事情会变成什么样，然后让你知道你的位置。”阿撒泽尔并不幻想全能者会区分胁迫和激情之间的差别，但这是一个足够可信的谎言。

“Absolutely,” Raphael agreed readily. “I had to heal the bruises.”  
“当然，”拉斐尔毫不犹豫地同意道。“我得治疗那些淤伤。”

Leaving passionate bruising on Raphael wasn’t a thought he needed while trying to focus his sorcery on that many targets at once. It took him two tries to get a lock. The smell of brimstone and hot ashes filled the entire floor as the cast went off.  
在拉斐尔身上留下激情的淤青并不是他在同时集中精力施展魔法时需要考虑的事情。他尝试了两次才锁定目标。硫磺和热灰的气味弥漫整个楼层，随着咒语的发动。

The human Pimpernel would remember coming up with the wine-merchant ruse. He would remember sailing to France with one of his agents and setting up the logistics, getting captured to break into the Bastille to drug the children, and then smuggling them all out.  
人类的皮姆佩内尔会记得自己想出了以酒商为幌子的计策。他会记得与自己的一名特工一起航行到法国，安排后勤工作，被俘以便闯入巴士底狱给孩子们下药，然后将他们全部走私出来。

What actually happened was that Azazel’s sorcery had plunked him outside of Paris with two large wagons full of empty barrels, accompanied by whoever had been standing closest to him (who, of course, would now remembered joining the Pimpernel’s crusade and eagerly anticipating his first mission), and seventy-four children who had no memory of how they’d gotten there. This time the children would be miraculously silent during the guards’ inspection.  
实际发生的是，阿撒兹尔的巫术将他带到了巴黎外面，带着两辆装满空桶的大车，还有站在他身边的人（当然，现在他们会记得加入了石童的远征，并迫切期待着他们的第一个任务），以及七十四个不记得自己是怎么到那里的孩子。这一次，孩子们在卫兵检查时会奇迹般地保持安静。

Azazel spent a minor sorcery changing Raphael into a proper sans-colette outfit, complete with a hat to cover his distinctive hair. He used another to ensure neither of them were noticed in the chaos of Azazel’s miracle being noticed by the guards. It was exhausting. Instead of lunch, Azazel led them both to his temporary (very, very temporary; the sooner he could return to his gorgeous book-filled home in London the better) dwelling. The one-room flat was outfitted in pseudo-Roman Republic furniture and economical curtains, the very picture of Directoire sensibilities. It was dreadful.  
阿撒泽尔用一种小巧的魔法将拉斐尔变成了一套合适的无领外套，还带上了一顶帽子，遮住了他独特的头发。他又用另一种魔法确保他们在混乱的情况下不会被卫兵注意到，这真是令人精疲力尽。阿撒泽尔带着他们两个去了他的临时住所（非常非常临时；他越快能回到伦敦那个装满美丽书籍的家就越好）。这个单间公寓装饰着伪罗马共和国的家具和经济型窗帘，完全符合总裁制的审美。真是糟糕透了。

There were no crepes at the flat, just wine. Raphael was very solicitous, fluffing the pad of the banquette for Azazel to recline on, pouring for them both and moving one of the nesting tables closer for Azazel to set his glass upon. The angel chose one of the curved chairs to inhabit, pulling off the ugly red hat and dropping it on the taller nesting table. What the archangel did could hardly be called sitting.  
公寓里没有煎饼，只有葡萄酒。拉斐尔非常殷勤，为阿撒泽尔蓬松了长凳的垫子，为他们两人倒酒，还把一个嵌套桌子移近，方便阿撒泽尔放置酒杯。天使选择了其中一把弯曲的椅子坐下，摘下那顶丑陋的红帽子，随意地放在较高的嵌套桌上。大天使所做的几乎不能称之为坐着。

There was still Dagon to attend to. It would be better to do this while Azazel was too tired to follow through. In full possession of his faculties, he would easily get carried away.  
还有达贡要处理。最好在阿撒泽尔太累无法跟进的时候处理这件事。如果他完全清醒，很容易会失控。

The demon drained half his glass, set it on the table, and then slid all the way down until he was more lying than reclining.  
恶魔喝光了他杯子里的一半酒，把杯子放在桌子上，然后一直滑到底，直到他更像是躺着而不是斜躺着。

“Come sit on my lap, my dear,” he told Raphael.  
他对拉斐尔说：“亲爱的，来坐在我腿上。”

The archangel dropped his wineglass. It shattered on the floor, wine seeping across the wood. Raphael-- well, fluttered was really the only word for it, searching for and finding a towel for the wine and then picking up the pieces of glass.  
大天使不小心把酒杯掉在地上，碎片散落一地，红酒渗透进木地板。拉斐尔——嗯，用"fluttered"这个词形容他的动作最贴切，他找到一块毛巾擦拭红酒，然后捡起玻璃碎片。

“I haven’t changed my mind about the favor,” Azazel continued as Raphael managed the mess. “Dagon usually takes my word for things, but when I claim that I committed a major miracle to Tempt an angel-- My dear, someone is going to check the rolls for a Temptation. I don’t have to take you. Pleasure will do nicely.”  
“对于这个请求，我没有改变主意。”亚撒泽尔在拉斐尔处理混乱时继续说道。“达贡通常会相信我的话，但当我声称我进行了一次重大的奇迹来引诱一个天使时——亲爱的，有人会检查诱惑的记录。我不需要带上你。享乐会很好。”

Raphael swallowed. He nodded. It seemed to take ages for him to dispose of the glass shards in the dustbin and wash his hands. He approached the banquette and swung one long leg over Azazel to place his knee by the demon’s side. While Raphael pulled his other knee up onto the cushion, Azazel bent his legs to form a sort of chair with his thighs and pelvis. Raphael seated himself and made a pleasant sort of wiggle to get comfortable. Azazel couldn’t feel an effort pressing into him, so at least the angel had some common sense. There would be no holy fire like there’d been with Poyel. It would rather defeat the purpose of saving Raphael from the guillotine.  
拉斐尔吞了口口水，点了点头。他花了很长时间才把玻璃碎片扔进垃圾桶并洗手。他走近长凳，一条长腿跨过阿撒泽尔，将膝盖放在恶魔身旁。拉斐尔把另一条腿抬到垫子上，阿撒泽尔弯曲双腿，形成了一个类似椅子的姿势。拉斐尔坐下来，微微晃动身体以找到舒适的姿势。阿撒泽尔感觉不到有什么压力，至少这个天使还有些常识。不会像波伊尔那样有圣火出现。否则，救拉斐尔脱离断头台的目的就会失败了。

“Now, let down your wings.”  
“现在，放下你的翅膀。”

“My--” Raphael began, but he unfurled his wings from the aether. The feathers were better groomed than most angels, but nowhere near as what was normal for a demon. Azazel made a mental note to chide him later. Grooming your wings wasn’t _merely_ pleasant, it was _also_ good for the feathers.  
“我——”拉斐尔开始说，但他从以太中展开了他的翅膀。这些羽毛比大多数天使的羽毛修整得更好，但远不及恶魔的常态。阿撒泽尔心里记下了稍后要责备他。修整翅膀不仅仅是愉快的事情，对羽毛也有好处。

“Now lean down so I can touch them.” Azazel hadn’t known at the time the exact nature of how pleasant it had been to have Raphael’s fingers in his feathers, why it had felt so much better than grooming his wings himself. Watching humans for five thousand years or so had given him some perspective. It should feel good enough to constitute a temptation, even if stopping without any effort-bits would be a tormenting experience for Raphael.  
“现在弯下身子，让我碰一下。”阿撒泽尔当时并不知道拉斐尔的手指在他的羽毛中触摸的感觉有多么愉快，为什么比自己梳理翅膀要舒服得多。观察人类大约五千年给了他一些观点。这应该足够好，足以构成一种诱惑，即使停下来没有任何努力也会是一种折磨性的经历对于拉斐尔来说。

That thought sent a thrill down Azazel’s body.  
那个念头让阿撒泽尔全身充满了兴奋。

Right. They need to move this right along before Azazel recuperated. He didn’t trust his future self with a sexually frustrated Raphael in his lap.  
没错。他们需要在阿撒泽尔恢复之前尽快行动起来。他不敢让他未来的自己坐在他腿上受到性挫折的拉斐尔身边。

Raphael leaned forward, one hand above each of Azazel’s shoulders.  
拉斐尔向前倾身，一只手放在阿撒泽尔的肩膀上。

“Not really certain what this is going to accomplish, hellfire,” Raphael stated.  
"不太确定这会有什么效果，见鬼了，"拉斐尔说道。

In response Azazel trailed his fingers sideways through the middle coverts of the left wing. Raphael shivered. Azazel proceeded gently, alternating between one wing and the other. He found the sensitive spots (the alula and the greater coverts) and the ticklish ones (scapulars, tertiaries). Then the demon placed one hand on each wing and dug in without mercy. He alternated intensity, pulling roughly at the scapulars and tertiaries to keep Raphael from dissolving into giggles, running his hands through the broad flight feathers, and using the gentlest of touches on the alulas and greater coverts. Even cockless, Raphael’s hips moved of their own accord, pressing down onto Azazel’s body.  
亚撒谢尔的手指沿着左翅膀的中央羽片轻轻滑过，拉斐尔不禁打了个寒颤。亚撒谢尔温柔地继续，轮流抚摸每只翅膀。他找到了敏感的部位（飞节和大羽片），以及容易发痒的地方（肩羽和次级飞羽）。然后，恶魔双手分别放在每只翅膀上，毫不留情地用力按压。他交替使用不同的力度，粗暴地拉扯肩羽和次级飞羽，以免拉斐尔笑得不可自制，同时轻柔地抚摸宽阔的飞羽，温柔地触碰飞节和大羽片。即使没有勃起，拉斐尔的臀部也不受控制地向下压在亚撒谢尔的身上。

Raphael’s feathers were as soft as a psalm. His purple eyes were blown wide, a sheen of sweat soaking his cravat. Raphael was vocal, breathy when Azazel was rough and begging when he tormented the sensitive spots. He was an absolute mess when Azazel tutted and called him a wicked creature.  
拉斐尔的羽毛柔软得像一首圣诗。他紫色的眼睛睁得大大的，汗水浸湿了他的领结。当阿撒泽尔粗暴对待他时，拉斐尔会发出声音，喘着气；当他折磨拉斐尔敏感的地方时，拉斐尔会乞求。当阿撒泽尔责备他并称他为邪恶的生物时，他变得一团糟。

Azazel wanted more. He wanted to pull Raphael down for kisses, to feel those pleasured noises against his own skin. To touch skin instead of feathers, and be touched in return. To make an effort and lock his wings with Raphael’s, to _claim_ the angel in every--  
阿撒谢尔想要更多。他想要拉住拉斐尔亲吻，感受那些愉悦的声音在自己的皮肤上。触摸皮肤而不是羽毛，并得到回应的触摸。努力地与拉斐尔锁住翅膀，将天使完全占为己有--

He didn’t dare. Poyel had Fallen at the moment of transition from foreplay to the main act. Azazel couldn’t risk anything that might convince the Almighty that Raphael was intending intercourse. Azazel had no idea where kissing fell on that foreplay/sex line for the Almighty. Poyel hadn’t had any interest in the humans’ mouth-touching and Azazel hadn’t had any intention of doing more than the absolute minimum necessary to break Poyel’s certainty.  
他不敢。在前戏过渡到正式行为的那一刻，波伊尔堕落了。阿撒泽尔不能冒险做任何可能让全能者相信拉斐尔有意进行性行为的事情。阿撒泽尔不知道亲吻在全能者的前戏/性行为界限上属于哪一类。波伊尔对人类的接吻没有兴趣，而阿撒泽尔也没有打算做更多只是为了打破波伊尔的确定性所必需的最低限度。

Azazel should have stopped when Raphael’s arms stopped being able to hold him up. That was enough temptation to generate a report.  
当拉斐尔的手臂无法支撑住阿撒泽尔时，他应该停下来。这已经足够引发一份报告的诱惑了。

But Raphael was pleading so sweetly for Azazel _not_ to stop, ragged and wet and raw. Surely, a little more couldn’t hurt. Just until the angel asked him to stop lest an effort manifest on its own.  
但是拉斐尔如此甜蜜地恳求阿撒泽尔不要停下来，破烂、湿漉漉和疼痛。肯定再多一点也不会有害处。只要直到天使要求他停下来，以免出现不必要的努力。

The demon laid his legs flat so Raphael could lie on top of him. With his right hand, he urged Raphael to hook his chin over the demon’s shoulder. Azazel could feel the archangel panting against the skin above his collar. Raphael was gripping the demon’s shoulders tightly enough to bruise. The urgency of his desire was deeply satisfying.  
恶魔把双腿摊开，让拉斐尔可以躺在他身上。他用右手示意拉斐尔把下巴挂在恶魔的肩膀上。阿撒泽尔能感觉到大天使在他领口上喘息。拉斐尔紧紧抓住恶魔的肩膀，足够用力以至于会留下淤伤。他的欲望的迫切感让人深感满足。

Azazel used his other hand to grab the top joint of one wing and double his efforts. Raphael’s hips rolled against the demon’s thighs in a stuttering rhythm.  
阿撒谢尔用另一只手抓住一只翅膀的顶节，加倍努力。拉斐尔的臀部在恶魔的大腿上以一种断断续续的节奏滚动着。

“You wicked creature,” Azazel scolded lightly, “look at you. What would Heaven think if they saw you like this, trying to climax from having your wings played with? But they haven’t seen, and they won’t. I’m the only one who has ever done this to you.” Azazel lowered his voice to almost a whisper. “You have no idea how pleasant that is, my dear.”  
“你这个邪恶的家伙，”阿撒泽尔轻轻责备道，“看看你自己。如果天堂看到你这样，试图通过玩弄你的翅膀来达到高潮，他们会怎么想？但他们没有看到，也不会看到。只有我一个人曾经对你这样做过。”阿撒泽尔的声音降低到几乎是耳语。“亲爱的，你根本不知道那是多么愉快。”

Azazel wasn’t certain what reaction he’d been expecting, but a long shuddering gasp and Raphael’s entire body shaking wasn’t it. He’d either made the angel orgasm without any effort being made, or--  
阿撒谢尔不确定自己期待着什么反应，但长长的喘息和拉斐尔全身颤抖的情景并不是他所预料的。他要么是让天使在没有任何努力的情况下达到了高潮，要么……

Azazel slipped the hand that had been stroking Raphael’s feathers down between the angel’s legs. The archangel’s trousers were damp. So were Azazel’s trousers, not that his thighs felt it through the expensive wool.  
阿撒泽尔将一直在摸拉斐尔羽毛的手滑到了天使的腿间。大天使的裤子湿了。阿撒泽尔的裤子也湿了，尽管他的大腿无法感受到那湿气，因为他穿着昂贵的羊毛裤子。

Raphael _had_ made an effort, just not the effort Azazel had been expecting.  
拉斐尔确实付出了努力，只是不是亚撒谛尔所期望的那种努力。

No common sense. None. None _whatsoever_, of all the _reckless, pointless, stupid_ things to Fall for--  
没有常识。一点都没有。所有那些鲁莽、毫无意义、愚蠢的事情，竟然会陷入其中——

Nothing was happening. Oh, Raphael was nuzzling him and adjusting his position as if Azazel was some sort of marvelous body pillow, clearly settling in for a nap, and he was murmuring praises about how lovely that felt and how generally wonderful Azazel was. But there was no holy fire, no reek of burned feathers. Nothing.  
什么都没有发生。哦，拉斐尔正在亲昵地蹭着他，调整着他的姿势，仿佛阿撒泽尔是一种了不起的抱枕，显然是要打个盹，他还低声赞美着这种感觉有多么美妙，以及阿撒泽尔是多么了不起。但是没有圣火，没有烧焦羽毛的臭味。什么都没有。

Azazel tilted his head up, torn between staying angry and an unfathomable sense of relief. He would _never_ understand the Almighty. Never.  
阿撒谢尔抬起头，陷入愤怒和难以理解的宽慰之间。他永远无法理解全能者。永远不会。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Two demons in the Bentley was one demon two many.  
两个恶魔坐在宾利里，一个恶魔就已经够多了。

Azazel didn’t think Crowley was much of a demon. He hadn’t been shy with his opinion during the drive, nor about demanding an accounting of Crowley’s demonic accomplishments. When Crowley had protested that he wouldn’t be called on the carpet by Azazel, Azazel had listed his own demonic _curriculum vitae_.  
阿撒谛尔并不认为克劳利是一个真正的恶魔。在车上，他毫不掩饰自己的观点，也毫不客气地要求克劳利列举自己的恶魔成就。当克劳利抗议称自己不会被阿撒谛尔指责时，阿撒谛尔列举了自己的恶魔履历。

The list was-- 名单如下--

Well, frankly, impressive. Much more so than Crowley’s reluctantly-provided widespread annoyances and forays into infrastructure. Azazel pointed out the comparative deficiency immediately.  
坦白说，令人印象深刻。比克劳利勉强提供的广泛烦恼和对基础设施的冒险要多得多。阿撒泽尔立即指出了比较的不足之处。

For all Aziraphale’s frivolous miracle use and his inability to maintain any level of detachment from the physical world and its pleasures, he was actually good at his job. He had a knack for humans. Almost all of the competing assignments they’d had had chosen Aziraphale, not Crowley. Heaven had even tried to promote him, once, only to turn the promotion into a greater commendation when they’d changed their minds on the other principalities’ chances against Crowley. And wasn’t that itself an indication of his effectiveness, Arrangement or no?  
对于阿齐拉费尔轻率地使用奇迹，以及他无法保持与物质世界及其享乐的任何程度的分离，他实际上在他的工作上表现得很好。他对人类有一种天赋。几乎所有竞争的任务都选择了阿齐拉费尔，而不是克劳利。天堂甚至曾试图提拔他，只是在他们改变对克劳利与其他主权国家机会的看法后，将提升变成了更大的表彰。这本身不就是他的有效性的一个指示吗？无论是安排与否。

Azazel, on the other hand, had managed an equal amount of diabolical persuasion in addition to tricking seven angels into Falling.  
然而，阿撒泽尔成功地进行了同样数量的邪恶劝说，并成功诱使七位天使堕落。

Aziraphale didn’t like it. He wanted Azazel out of the car and gone as much as Crowley did.  
亚齐拉费尔不喜欢这样。他和克劳利一样，希望阿撒泽尔离开车子，消失无踪。

Worse, Azazel seemed to believe in the justness of Hell’s rebellion as much as Aziraphale had once believed in Heaven. (And still did, to some extent, if he was completely honest.) Aziraphale’s attempts to diffuse the situation had been greeted with an imperious command to stay out of Hell’s business.  
更糟糕的是，阿撒泽尔似乎和亚齐拉菲尔一样，坚信地狱的叛乱是正义的。（而且，如果他完全诚实的话，他对天堂的信仰仍然存在一定程度上。）亚齐拉菲尔试图化解局势，却被傲慢地命令不要干涉地狱的事务。

Aziraphale thought that Raphael could at least _try_ to reign in his demon. But as an archangel, Raphael did technically outrank him, and with the representatives of Hell fighting it wouldn’t do for the angels to also be sniping at each other. It set a bad example.  
亚齐拉费尔认为拉斐尔至少应该试着控制住他的恶魔。但作为大天使，拉斐尔在地位上确实高于他，而且地狱的代表们正在战斗，天使们也不能互相攻击。这会树立一个不好的榜样。

Raphael’s silence was disturbing on another level. Aziraphale had always thought Crowley was more or less content to let Aziraphale lead because the demon was, at heart, quite a nice person, and therefore recognized (deep down) the inherent superiority of good. But Raphael seemed to have a similar contentment towards Azazel.  
拉斐尔的沉默在另一个层面上令人不安。阿齐拉费尔一直以为克劳利更或多或少满足于让阿齐拉费尔领导，因为恶魔本质上是个相当好的人，因此在内心深处承认善的优越性。但是拉斐尔似乎对阿撒泽尔有着类似的满足感。

A demon, especially a demon who broke angels, would have pursued his Heavenly Adversary as Crowley had. But Raphael had not consistently rejected even the barest hint of anything other than a professional relationship for six thousand years like Aziraphale. Not with Azazel’s hand covering Raphael’s on the stick shift, well prior to the failed Armageddon.  
一个恶魔，尤其是一个打破天使的恶魔，会像克劳利一样追逐他的天敌。但是拉斐尔并没有像阿齐拉费尔那样在六千年里一直坚决拒绝除了专业关系以外的任何暗示。在失败的末日之前，阿撒兹勒的手已经覆盖在拉斐尔的换挡杆上。

“Well that’s a bit eviler-than-thou,” Crowley snarled at Azazel.  
“嗯，这可真是比你更邪恶啊，”克劳利对阿撒泽尔咆哮道。

“Yes, I _am_ eviler-than-thou, quite a bit, actually. That’s my _point_.”  
是的，我比你更邪恶，而且相当多。这就是我的观点。

It was too similar, too similar by _half_ and Aziraphale couldn’t take it anymore.  
太相似了，相似得过分，阿齐拉费尔再也无法忍受了。

“Now that is enough,” Aziraphale said, matching Azazel’s lofty tone. He laid a silencing hand on Crowley’s wrist. “Raphael, do something, _please_.”  
“现在就够了，”亚齐拉费尔以亚撒赛尔高傲的语调说道。他用手轻轻按住克劳利的手腕，示意他安静下来。“拉斐尔，请做点什么，拜托。”

So much for setting a good example.  
好好树立榜样的想法可真是白费了。

“How much did soul contracts in London spike after the M25 opened?” Raphael asked evenly.  
拉斐尔平静地问道：“M25开通后，伦敦的灵魂契约有多大幅度增长？”

After several false-start syllables and a sideways glance at Aziraphale, Crowley finally answered, “mmnotgonna answer that.”  
在几个虚假的音节和斜视了一眼阿齐拉费尔后，克劳利终于回答道：“嗯，不会回答那个。”

“Ten percent? Fifteen?” Raphael guessed.  
"百分之十？百分之十五？" 拉斐尔猜测道。

“Retired. Don’t need a performance review.” Crowley slumped down, his shins pressed against the back of Azazel’s seat.  
退休了，不需要绩效评估。”克劳利低头垂下，他的小腿紧贴着阿撒泽尔座位的背部。

“Crowley?” Aziraphale asked softly. Crowley had only made one-on-one temptations when they were assignments on the checklist. That what he’d come up with on his own was always non-specific, non-individualized, and rather petty in many respects… it had always seemed like mercy. Raphael’s question was troubling. Had it been strategy, instead?  
“克劳利？”亚齐拉费尔轻声问道。克劳利只有在任务清单上的一对一引诱时才会出现。他自己想出来的东西总是不具体、不个性化，而且在很多方面都相当琐碎……这总是看起来像是仁慈。拉斐尔的问题让人困扰。这是策略吗？

Crowley set his jaw in mulish silence.  
克劳利顽固地闭上了嘴。

“Fallen or not, angels are built for specific purposes, hellfire,” Raphael continued. “Doling out jobs based on who’s crueler or kisses up to the boss like Hell does doesn’t magically make us capable of human versatility. You were a principality, and you approach tempting like a principality – focusing on your assigned person or persons like a... celestial factory-man. Archangels are administrators: large groups and long-term strategy. People are meaner, more insecure, and more isolated from each other where he’s from, I can guarantee it. ‘Love your neighbor’ isn’t getting very far there anymore than Hell’s ‘every man for himself’ succeeds against me cultivating the welfare state here. Winning battles isn’t the same as winning the war.”  
“堕落与否，天使都有特定的目的，地狱之火，”拉斐尔继续说道。“根据谁更残忍或向上司巴结来分配工作，并不能让我们像人类一样具备多样性。你曾经是一个领主，你对引诱的方式也像一个领主——专注于你所指派的人，就像一个...天上的工厂工人。大天使是管理者：负责大规模的群体和长期的策略。在他来自的地方，人们更加残忍、更加不安全，彼此之间更加孤立，我可以保证。‘爱你的邻居’在那里并没有取得多大进展，就像地狱的‘人人为己’在我培养福利国家方面也没有成功一样。赢得战斗并不等于赢得战争。”

Azazel drew his hand away from Raphael’s. Clearly he didn’t like that answer any more than Aziraphale did.  
阿撒泽尔把手从拉斐尔的手上拿开了。显然，他对这个答案的喜欢程度不亚于阿齐拉费尔。

“Heaven does all right,” Aziraphale corrected, feeling like he was obligated to at least make it look like Heaven hadn’t completely ignored Crowley’s crowd-based temptations as unimportant. Old habits. “They narrowed the definition of ‘neighbor’ somewhat, partially embraced weapons in the right hands, and placed more emphasis on defending righteousness against sin and secularization, rather than charity. Humanity seems content with the new thinking. They’ve expanded on it quite enthusiastically.” In most unpleasant ways.  
“天堂还算不错，”亚齐拉费尔纠正道，感觉自己有义务至少让天堂看起来没有完全忽视克劳利以群众为基础的诱惑，认为它不重要。老习惯。“他们在‘邻舍’的定义上有所收窄，部分接受了合适人手中的武器，并更加强调捍卫正义对抗罪恶和世俗化，而不是慈善。人类似乎对这种新思维感到满意。他们非常热衷地扩展了它。”以最不愉快的方式。

Raphael let go of the wheel and nearly turned around in his seat. Azazel hastily grabbed the wheel with one hand.  
拉斐尔松开方向盘，几乎要转过身来。阿撒泽尔匆忙用一只手抓住了方向盘。

“Sandalphon?” Raphael’s voice was breathy with anger. “Are you telling me that Heaven is taking strategy advice from that ignorant, short-sighted, war-mongering, pain-happy _bootlicker_?! Did they give him my department? My _people_?”  
“桑达尔芬？”拉斐尔的声音充满愤怒。“你是在告诉我天堂正在接受那个无知、目光短浅、好战、喜欢给人带来痛苦的马屁精的战略建议？他们把我的部门交给了他吗？我的人？”

“My dear,” Azazel said tightly, “I would like to remind you that I don’t actually know what I’m doing, so if you don’t want to discorporate us all--”  
“亲爱的，”阿撒泽尔紧张地说道，“我想提醒你，我其实不知道我在做什么，所以如果你不想让我们全部消散--”

Raphael turned back around. He didn’t need to hold the wheel to drive, but it was best to have his eyes on the road.  
拉斐尔转过身来。他不需要握住方向盘来驾驶，但最好还是把眼睛放在路上。

“I think,” Azazel stated, fidgeting his hands before folding them primly in his lap, “that we should table this discussion and focus on dealing with the matter at hand, namely, this ‘Adam’s’ alteration of the very structure of time in the universe, or… whatever he has done. Fixing that and averting Armageddon are problems enough.” He nodded once. As if he hadn’t started this fight in the first place. Insufferable.  
“我觉得，”阿撒泽尔说道，不安地玩弄着双手，然后整齐地叠放在膝盖上，“我们应该搁置这个讨论，专注于处理眼前的问题，也就是这个‘亚当’对宇宙时间结构的改变，或者说……他到底做了什么。解决这个问题和避免世界末日已经够麻烦了。”他点了点头，仿佛他并没有首先引发这场争斗一样。真是让人受不了。

Several miles went by in silence. They were in Tadfield proper, almost to Adam’s house. It would be over soon, Aziraphale was certain.  
几英里的路程在沉默中度过。他们正处于塔德菲尔德的中心，几乎到了亚当的家。很快就会结束了，阿兹拉菲尔确信无疑。

“You didn’t tell me,” Crowley whispered. He’d slumped even farther down in the seat, in a position that couldn’t possibly have been comfortable if Crowley wasn’t part serpent. He was looking out the window at the stars.  
“你没告诉我。”克劳利低声说道。他在座位上更往下沉了一些，这个姿势对于克劳利来说肯定不舒服，除非他不是一条蛇。他望着窗外的星星。

“I didn’t think you’d care,” Aziraphale replied just as quietly. “You did rebel, after all, and you seemed, well. Rather content being-- your own man. So to speak.”  
“我没想到你会在意，”亚齐拉费尔轻声回答道。“毕竟，你曾经背叛过，而且你似乎，嗯，相当满足于做你自己。就这么说吧。”

Crowley shrugged. “It had it’s moments. Listen, angel--”  
克劳利耸了耸肩。“有它的时刻。听着，天使——”

“Best not to think on it,” Aziraphale cut the demon off. It had always done the trick before. “As you say, you are retired now.” They were on their own side. The burden of ghosts from the previous sides was heavy enough without feeding them.  
“最好别想这个了。”亚齐拉费尔打断了恶魔的话。这招以前总是奏效的。“就像你说的，你现在已经退休了。”他们是站在自己这一边的。之前那些阵营的幽灵已经足够沉重了，不需要再去滋养它们。

The Bentley pulled onto Adam’s street. There were police cars surrounding the Young house. They had been there long enough to erect a barrier to keep away the nosy neighbors willing to brave the December cold for a little bit of gossip. Raphael parked slightly away from the small crowd. They could see the Youngs through the living room window, lit like a zoetrope by the lamps within. They were talking to a pair of severe gentlemen in suits who were most definitely investigators from out of town. Adam himself was nowhere to be seen, and neither were the Them.  
宾利停在亚当的街道上。警车围绕着杨家的房子。他们已经在那里待了足够长的时间，竖起了屏障，以阻止那些愿意冒着十二月的寒冷来八卦一番的好奇邻居。拉斐尔将车停在离人群稍远的地方。他们透过客厅的窗户可以看到杨家人，被室内的灯光照亮，就像一个旋转动画一样。他们正在与一对穿着严肃的绅士交谈，这两位绅士明显是外地的调查员。亚当本人不见了，他们也不见了。

“I’m going to guess the kid’s not there,” Raphael said. “I mean, nothing else about this has gone smoothly, why start now? Hellfire, you mind making one of the constables more talkative?” Azazel snapped his fingers. One of the officers manning the barrier stiffened noticeably.  
“我猜小孩不在那里。”拉斐尔说道。“我的意思是，这件事情从头到尾都不顺利，为什么现在要开始呢？地狱火，你能不能让其中一个警察多说点话？”阿撒泽尔响了一下手指。一个守卫栅栏的警察明显变得僵硬起来。

“You could have just asked,” Aziraphale complained.  
“你本可以直接问的，”阿齐拉费尔抱怨道。

“Sure, police love talking about active cases with complete strangers.” Raphael climbed out of the car.  
“当然，警察喜欢与完全陌生的人谈论正在进行的案件。”拉斐尔从车里爬了出来。

Aziraphale supposed he had a point. He still didn’t have to default to hypnotism as easily as his demonic counterpart. It was disturbing. Aziraphale and Crowley followed behind the other two as they wove through the clumps of people watching the scene unfold, as undramatic as it was. Still, in a small town, there wasn’t much else to do.  
亚齐拉费尔觉得他说得有道理。他并不像他那个恶魔伙伴那样轻易地使用催眠术。这让他感到不安。亚齐拉费尔和克劳利跟在另外两个人的后面，穿过人群的团块，观看着场景的发展，虽然并不戏剧化。然而，在一个小镇上，也没有太多其他事可做。

The constable’s story wasn’t at all what Aziraphale expected: Adam had left with his music teacher that morning and hadn’t been seen since.  
警官的故事并不是亚齐拉费尔所预料的：亚当今天早上和他的音乐老师一起离开后就再也没有出现过。

“Did the kid have a music teacher?” Crowley asked.  
克劳利问道：“那个孩子有音乐老师吗？”

“Not that I am aware, no,” Aziraphale stated. He turned to the betwitched constable. “Hello. Ah, what of the boy’s friends? Were they kidnapped as well?”  
“我没有意识到，没有。”亚齐拉费尔说道。他转向被施咒的警官。“你好。啊，那个男孩的朋友们呢？他们也被绑架了吗？”

“Adam doesn’t have friends,” the constable said mechanically. “He’s a weird kid. Loner, reads a lot, tried to build magical bodyguards out of mud. His room is full of weird stuff, like some weird Jewish remake of The Coven. He named his dog ‘Demonsbane,’ for Christ’s sake. His parents should be just as glad to be rid of him, if you ask me.”  
“亚当没有朋友，”警官机械地说道。“他是个奇怪的孩子。孤僻，喜欢读书，还试图用泥巴制造魔法护卫。他的房间里摆满了奇怪的东西，就像是某种奇怪的犹太版《女巫会》。他把狗取名为‘恶魔斩杀者’，天哪。如果你问我，他的父母应该对他离开感到庆幸。”

Aziraphale had no idea what a “remake of The Coven” was, but building soldiers out of mud sounded like trying to make golems. Angelic script looked like Hebrew to the untrained eye. Someone had thought of the same idea Crowley and Aziraphale had – but tutoring the right boy to be firmly on Heaven’s side. It was entirely possible that talking Adam out of Armageddon was no longer a solution. Worse, a Hellhound named “Demonsbane” would not be an adorable terrier who chased cats. It would likely be closer to its true form, and it would most certainly try to kill Crowley on sight.  
亚齐拉费尔对“女巫团的翻拍”一事毫无头绪，但用泥土制造士兵听起来像是在制作傀儡。对于未经训练的眼睛来说，天使文字看起来像是希伯来语。有人想到了与克劳利和亚齐拉费尔相同的主意——培养一个坚定站在天堂一边的男孩。说服亚当放弃世界末日的可能性已经不再是一个解决方案。更糟糕的是，名为“恶魔杀手”的地狱猎犬不会是一只可爱的小猎犬追逐猫咪。它很可能会接近它真正的形态，并且肯定会试图一见到克劳利就杀死他。

“This music teacher, what do they look like? Anyone know?” Crowley asked.  
“这个音乐老师长什么样？有人知道吗？”克劳利问道。

“The description we have out is for an American male, a hundred and eighty centimeters, dark hair, square build. Parents say he has purple eyes, but we expect those are contacts which he won’t be wearing now that he’s made off with the boy,” the constable recited.  
“我们发布的描述是一个美国男性，身高一百八十厘米，黑发，方形身材。父母说他有紫色的眼睛，但我们认为那些是隐形眼镜，他现在应该不会戴着了，因为他已经带着那个男孩逃走了。”警官背诵道。

Raphael made a long, low growl that rolled into the name: “Gabriel.”  
拉斐尔发出了一声长而低沉的咆哮，声音中融入了一个名字：“加百列。”

“Yes, well, thank you, that’s all the information we need,” Aziraphale said. “You’ve been most helpful.” Azazel released the constable with a snap. The four celestial entities wove their way back through the neighbors. No one stopped to question them, which was probably another demonic miracle from Azazel.  
“是的，好的，谢谢，这就是我们需要的所有信息，”阿齐拉费尔说。“你非常有帮助。”阿撒泽尔一声响指，释放了警官。四位天界实体穿过邻居们的身旁回去了。没有人停下来质疑他们，这可能又是阿撒泽尔的另一个恶魔奇迹。

“So Gabriel has been grooming Adam while the two of them were instructing Warlock, which is concerning enough,” Aziraphale thought aloud to Crowley, “but how could he possibly know who Adam was? Or what he was, rather. Hastur burned the medical records, there was nothing to lead him here. We only found out because of Agnes – speaking of which, where is Anathema? The book would shed light on the matter.”  
“所以加百列在他们两个指导沃洛克的同时，一直在照顾亚当，这已经令人担忧了，”亚齐拉费尔对克劳利说，“但他怎么可能知道亚当是谁？或者说，他是什么。哈斯特烧掉了医疗记录，没有任何线索能让他找到这里。我们之所以知道是因为阿格尼丝 - 说起来，安娜塔玛在哪里？那本书会解开这个谜团。”

“Who? What book?” Raphael demanded.  
“谁？什么书？”拉斐尔要求道。

“Well, since Gabriel made off with the bloody Antichrist, she’s not going to be here in Tadfield. She’s going to be wherever Armageddon is happening, with the book. No help there,” Crowley replied. He opened the Bentley’s door and slid behind the front seat. The car didn’t seem to recognize Crowley at all. Aziraphale slid after him. “So where are we at? Shadwell?”  
“嗯，既然加百列带着该死的敌基督逃走了，她不会在塔德菲尔德出现。她会在末日降临的地方，带着那本书。没有什么帮助可言。”克劳利回答道。他打开宾利车的车门，滑进前座。车似乎完全不认识克劳利。亚齐拉费尔也跟着滑进去。“那我们现在在哪里？沙德威尔？”

“Who or what is an anathema or a shad well, and what book would tell us where Armageddon is happening?” Raphael repeated after he’d climbed in as well, sitting half-turned in the seat.  
“谁或什么是诅咒或者沙德威尔，有哪本书能告诉我们末日战场在哪里？”拉斐尔也爬进车里后重复着，半转身坐在座位上。

“Anathema Device is the last living descendant of Agnes Nutter,” Aziraphale explained. “She possesses the only surviving copy of the Nice And Accurate Prophesies.” Azazel made an appropriately impressed sound. At least the demon wasn’t a total loss. “When we did this we ran into her on the road where we met you. Shadwell is the head of the Witchfinder Army, you’ve already met him--”  
“安娜瑟玛·迪维斯是阿格尼丝·纳特的最后一个活着的后代，”亚齐拉费尔解释道。“她拥有《准确无误的预言》的唯一幸存副本。”阿撒泽尔发出了一个适当印象深刻的声音。至少这个恶魔还不算完全失败。“我们在路上遇到了她，就是我们遇到你的地方。沙德维尔是女巫猎人军队的领导，你已经见过他了--”

“No, he hasn’t,” Crowley said, his voice oddly low, like his mind was somewhere else. “He’s an archangel. He wouldn’t need to steal holy water from a church. And why would he need human agents? He commands a quarter of the host of Heaven.”  
“不，他没有，”克劳利说道，声音异常低沉，仿佛他的思绪在别处。“他是一个大天使，不需要从教堂偷圣水。而且他为什么需要人类代理呢？他统领着天堂四分之一的天使军团。”

Raphael’s mouth opened in an “oh” of surprised understanding. His eyes were unfocused, looking at the roof of the Bentley without seeing it.  
拉斐尔的嘴巴张开，露出了一个惊讶而理解的表情。他的眼睛没有焦点，看着宾利车的车顶却没有看到。

“‘The only one in this room who should be Fallen is you,’” Raphael said in the same low, slow tones that Crowley was using. “But how are you two still here?” Raphael asked.  
“‘这个房间里唯一应该堕落的人是你，’” 拉斐尔用与克劳利相同的低沉、缓慢的语调说道。“但你们两个怎么还在这里？” 拉斐尔问道。

“I felt-- something.” Crowley’s voice was still odd, but he was becoming more animated as he warmed to his unspecified idea. “The spellwork, probably. I pulled us out of time because whatever it was, it was bad. But it wasn’t just ‘popping out’ like normal. It felt like time had turned into a basket of worms. I barely kept us together.”  
“我感觉到了——某种东西。”克劳利的声音依然怪异，但随着他对自己未明确的想法越来越感兴趣，他变得更加活跃起来。“很可能是咒语的作用。我把我们从时间中拉了出来，因为无论那是什么，都不是一般的‘突然出现’。感觉就像时间变成了一篮子蠕虫。我勉强让我们保持在一起。”

“Gabriel, you are an idiot every day of the week. Couldn’t you take just one day off?” Raphael addressed his statement to the Bentley’s roof.  
“Gabriel，你每天都是个白痴。你就不能休息一天吗？”拉斐尔对着宾利的车顶说道。

“I’m sorry, could someone please explain--” Aziraphale asked at the same time Azazel did.  
“对不起，请问有人可以解释一下吗？”亚齐拉费尔和阿撒泽尔同时问道。

“We – well, they-- stopped Armageddon,” Raphael explained. “So Gabriel tried to stop us/them from stopping it by changing the past. He couldn’t send an angel back, not with only three archangels to work with, but a note? That he could do.”  
“我们——嗯，他们——阻止了末日的来临，”拉斐尔解释道。“所以加百列试图阻止我们/他们阻止末日的行动，通过改变过去。他无法派遣一个天使回去，因为只有三位大天使可以使用，但一张便条呢？这是他能做到的。”

“But accurate prophesies are useless,” Azazel exclaimed. “They’re too specific. Until you stumble on to the context, you have no idea what they mean. Trying to defy one is madness. You would have no idea what got you to the point in the first place.”  
“但准确的预言是无用的，”阿撒泽尔大声说道。“它们太具体了。除非你偶然发现了背景，否则你根本不知道它们的意义。试图违抗一个预言是疯狂的。你根本不知道是什么让你陷入这个境地。”

“Yeah, but this is Gabriel,” Crowley said, leaning forward and resting his arms on the sides of either seat. “He’s not exactly the sharpest arrow in the Heavenly quiver. I will bet-- I’ll bet he sent back Adam’s information so he could make sure the kid wasn’t a ‘disobedient little brat.’ And-- he must have told himself to tell Michael not to put my name on the list. Because if Aziraphale and I are both in Heaven, there’s no one in Hell to conspire with.”  
“是的，但这是加百列，”克劳利说着，向前倾身，将手臂放在两个座位的侧边。“他可不是天堂箭袋里最聪明的箭。我敢打赌，他把亚当的信息发回去，只是为了确认那孩子不是个‘不听话的小坏蛋’。而且，他一定告诉自己要告诉迈克尔不要把我的名字放在名单上。因为如果阿齐拉费尔和我都在天堂，地狱就没有人可以密谋了。”

“But it backfired,” Aziraphale said, feeling the causes and effects in his brain like an old-fashioned switch-board. “Because something about you not Falling caused _me_ to-- to question or rebel in some fashion--”  
“但结果却适得其反，”亚齐拉费尔说道，他感觉到大脑中的因果关系就像一个老式的交换板一样。“因为你没有堕落的原因，导致我开始质疑或以某种方式反叛--”

“I didn’t,” Azazel stated.  
“我没有。” Azazel 说道。

“Well, obviously you did, you’re Fallen,” Aziraphale said, waving his hand.  
“嗯，显然你是的，你是堕落天使，”亚齐拉费尔挥了挥手。

“I _didn’t_,” Azazel repeated. “The Almighty just grabbed me by the neck and chucked me down last.”  
“我没有，”阿撒泽尔重复道。“全能者只是抓住我的脖子，把我扔到了最后。”

“The Almighty would not throw someone down without cause,” Aziraphale argued.  
“全能者不会无缘无故地将某人摔倒。”亚齐拉费尔辩解道。

“God would if it was part of the Ineffable Plan,” Crowley said. “I mean, Gabriel gets a note from the future saying ‘don’t do this or Armageddon is averted’ and the Almighty makes sure it happens anyway, you’re pretty much announcing that stopping Armageddon is your goal--”  
“如果这是无法言喻的计划的一部分，上帝会这样做的。”克劳利说。“我的意思是，加百列收到来自未来的一张纸条，上面写着‘如果你不这样做，就能避免末日’，但全能者还是确保它发生了，那你基本上就是在宣布你的目标是阻止末日了。”

“That’s too subtle for Gabriel to understand,” Raphael countered. “He’s more likely to decide there was some kind of list mix-up and go at me-- You? Us. With holy water the minute we’re Earthside. He _altered time,_ for Heaven’s sake.”  
“对加百列来说，这太微妙了，他无法理解。”拉斐尔反驳道。“他更有可能认为这是某种清单搞错了，然后对我——你？我们。在我们降临地球的那一刻，用圣水对付我们。他改变了时间，天啊。”

Azazel got out of the car. He walked, straight-backed and slow, looking for all the world like he’d just popped out for a night-time stroll. His black clothes would be nearly invisible to human eyes, with only flashing police lights for illumination. Raphael swore and climbed out after him.  
阿撒谢尔下了车。他笔直地走着，缓慢地寻找，看起来就像是刚刚出去散步一样。他的黑色衣服对人类的眼睛几乎是看不见的，只有闪烁的警车灯光照亮着。拉斐尔咒骂着，跟着他下了车。

Crowley put his hand out to forestall Aziraphale from following. “He’s going to need a minute. Look, if we’re right about Gabriel trying to change time, we’ve got a bigger problem than Armageddon. It’s… so stupid to mess with time.”  
克劳利伸出手，阻止了阿齐拉费尔的跟随。“他需要一点时间。听着，如果我们对加百利试图改变时间的推测是正确的，那么我们面临的问题比末日还要大。玩弄时间真是太愚蠢了。”

“I don’t understand. Why?” Aziraphale asked.  
“我不明白。为什么？”亚齐拉费尔问道。

“It’s…. it’s the grandfather paradox.” Crowley held his hands apart. “Let’s say you’re human, yeah? You somehow send yourself back in time,” he moved his left hand to his right, “and you kill your grandfather before he meets your grandmother.” He dropped his right hand. “No grandmother means no dad, means no you.”  
“这是……这就是祖父悖论。”克劳利张开双手说道。“假设你是人类，对吧？你以某种方式把自己送回过去，”他把左手移到右手边，“然后在他遇到你的祖母之前杀死了你的祖父。”他放下右手。“没有祖母就没有父亲，也就没有你。”

“So there’s no one to go back to kill the grandfather,” Aziraphale surmised. Crowley raised both hands together in response.  
“所以没有人可以回去杀死祖父，”阿齐拉费尔推测道。克劳利举起双手作为回应。

“So gramps is alive.” He moved the left hand back towards the left. “Meets gran, they have dad, and there you are again. But you don’t remember doing this all before, because the first timeline was erased when you killed your grandfather. So you do it all again.” Crowley moved his hands together.  
“老爷爷还活着。”他把左手移回左边。“遇见了奶奶，他们生了爸爸，然后你又出现了。但你不记得之前做过这一切，因为当你杀死你的祖父时，第一个时间线被抹去了。所以你又重复了一遍。”克劳利把双手放在一起。

“But now there’s no one to kill the grandfather again.”  
“但现在没有人再杀祖父了。”

“The only way to stop the paradox is to either to somehow stop yourself from going back in the first place, or to make sure that someone in the future sets things in motion to kill the grandfather even though you aren’t born. There’s no way I-- he’s-- we’re ever going to sit still and let the other three archangels send a note to change time back in time. We’re _going_ to insist on halting the paradox, because it’s mental not to. Worse, with Armageddon happening, any one of the archangels could die before it comes time to send the note back. Even if they’re not dead, they’re going to be too busy fighting Hell to risk all of them getting knocked out of power for a week by a time spell. Closing the paradox is doomed to failure.  
停止这个悖论的唯一方法要么是阻止自己一开始就回到过去，要么是确保未来的某个人推动事情发展，即使你还没有出生，也要杀死祖父。我——他——我们绝不会坐视其他三位大天使发出一张改变时间的便条。我们会坚决阻止这个悖论，因为不这样做太荒谬了。更糟糕的是，在末日来临时，任何一位大天使都有可能在发送便条之前死去。即使他们还活着，他们也会忙于与地狱作战，不会冒着被时间法术击败一周而失去权力的风险。关闭这个悖论注定会失败。

“Remember those singularities?” Crowley continued. “They hold everything together, and every time the timeline rewrites itself, they get a little bit weaker. Even if you close the paradox successfully, you’re going to damage those singularities once just by making the closed loop in the first place. I don’t know how much re-writing they can take. Hawking guessed a handful at most, and that... sounds about right. I don’t know if they’d collapse inward and implode or dissolve and everything flies apart, but when they go, everything affected by time will go as well.”  
“还记得那些奇点吗？”克劳利继续说道。“它们维系着一切，每当时间线重写自身，它们就会变得稍微弱一些。即使你成功关闭了悖论，仅仅通过创建封闭循环，你也会对那些奇点造成一次损害。我不知道它们能承受多少次重写。霍金猜测最多只能承受几次，这...听起来差不多对了。我不知道它们会向内坍缩和内爆，还是溶解并使一切四散，但当它们消失时，受时间影响的一切也将消失。”

Aziraphale’s head hurt.  亚齐拉费尔的头疼了。

Only the Almighty wasn’t affected by time. Angels, demons, the physical universe: whatever happened there wouldn’t be anyone around to fix it. God would have to start over from scratch.  
只有全能者不受时间的影响。天使、恶魔、物质世界：无论发生什么事情，都没有人能够修复。上帝将不得不从零开始。

“Well,” Aziraphale said slowly. “At least we have several tries before everything Falls apart.”  
“嗯，”亚齐拉费尔缓慢地说道。“至少在一切崩溃之前，我们还有几次机会。”

Crowley shook his head. “We may have done this three or four times already. We wouldn’t remember. We’ve got to get it right this time, even though we don’t know what or if we’ve tried anything before. This could be our last shot.”  
克劳利摇了摇头。“我们可能已经做过这个三四次了。我们不会记得。这一次我们必须做对，即使我们不知道之前是否尝试过什么。这可能是我们最后的机会。”

Aziraphale didn’t know what to say. What could he say? This was so much worse than a lost Antichrist, and neither he nor Crowley were terribly competent as these things went.  
亚齐拉费尔不知道该说什么。他能说什么呢？这比失去了一个反基督还要糟糕得多，而他和克劳利在这方面都不是特别能干。

The car doors opened. Raphael and Azazel had returned.  
车门打开了。拉斐尔和阿撒泽尔回来了。

“All right,” Raphael ordered. “We’ve got to move quickly. Gabriel is picking the staging grounds of Armageddon, so it’s going to be the Plains of Megiddo. We don’t have time for a five hour plane ride. So, we’re going to head back to the home office and split up. Aziraphale and I will go through Heaven, you and Azazel cut through Hell. We should be able to get around the distance that way, if we can get through the crowd. A Hellhound isn’t a problem for me, so if you and hellfire get there first, don’t get killed.”  
“好了，”拉斐尔下令道。“我们必须迅速行动。加百列正在挑选阿玛吉顿的集结地，所以将会是米吉多平原。我们没有时间坐五个小时的飞机。所以，我们要返回总部并分头行动。亚撒利亚和我会通过天堂，你和阿撒泽尔穿越地狱。这样我们应该能绕过距离，只要我们能穿过人群。地狱猎犬对我来说不是问题，所以如果你和地狱之火先到达那里，不要被杀掉。”

“Solid plan, sketchy on the details,” Crowley remarked.  
“计划可靠，细节有些模糊。”克劳利评论道。

“The only safe way to correct this is to stop Gabriel from sending that note back in the first place. We need him to create a message for his future-self saying it didn’t work. If you recharge while you’re in Hell, you can pull yourself, Aziraphale, and the message out of time before the next reset. Time will be fluid during the re-write, so stepping back into time right before the event shouldn’t be any more difficult than stepping out linearly like you did last time. If time is never altered, then this wrong timeline will never happen. Now, Gabriel is not going to listen if he’s fighting some endless stalemate with Hell on Earth. So, the plan is--”  
“唯一安全的方法是阻止加百利在第一时间发送那个便条。我们需要他为未来的自己创造一条信息，说这个计划失败了。如果你在地狱中充电，你可以在下一次重置之前将自己、亚西拉费尔和信息拉出时间。在重写过程中，时间将变得流动，所以回到事件之前的时间并不比上次线性地离开更困难。如果时间从未被改变，那么这个错误的时间线将永远不会发生。现在，如果加百利与地狱在地球上进行无休止的僵局，他是不会听从的。所以，计划是——"

“We kill the Antichrist,” Azazel said. “Then aggressively persuade Gabriel that it’s in his best interests to cooperate.”  
“我们杀掉反基督者，”亚撒谏说。“然后强烈劝说加百列，让他明白合作对他最有利。”

“Killing a child and beating an archangel into submission is not our plan, hellfire,” Raphael stated firmly. “The boy may have been groomed by Gabriel, but he is still a human with free will. You, myself, Khizir, and Crowley will deal with War, Pollution, Famine, and Gabriel. We’ll just have to hope that Death doesn’t snap his finger and call it curtains on us all. Aziraphale, you’ll need to convince this Antichrist to change his mind.”  
“杀死一个孩子并打败一个大天使并不是我们的计划，地狱之火，”拉斐尔坚定地说道。“这个男孩可能被加百列操纵过，但他仍然是一个有自由意志的人类。你、我、哈齐尔和克劳利将处理战争、污染、饥荒和加百列。我们只能希望死神不会轻轻一弹手指就让我们全部完蛋。亚齐拉费尔，你需要说服这个末日使者改变他的想法。”

Aziraphale nodded.  亚齐拉费尔点了点头。

“And if he doesn’t?” Azazel demanded. “Are you really going to let the entire universe, angels and all, be destroyed over one boy?”  
“如果他不这样做呢？”阿撒泽尔质问道。“你真的打算因为一个男孩而让整个宇宙，包括天使在内，都毁灭吗？”

“He’s going to.” 他要去。

“You don’t know that,” Azazel countered.  
“你不知道。”阿撒泽尔反驳道。

“It’ll work, hellfire, that’s the end of it.” He turned around and started the Bentley. Azazel thinned his lips and raised an eyebrow.  
“这会起作用的，见鬼，就这样了。”他转过身，发动了宾利。阿撒泽尔嘴唇变薄，挑起了一边眉毛。

It was a good plan. Aziraphale had a terrible feeling about it.  
这是一个好计划。阿齐拉费尔对此有一种可怕的感觉。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Before Raf had been sent Earthside, Khizir had been a watcher. Nanael had been the other. Between the two of them, they had split the Earth by hemisphere, organizing the Earth Observation files and coordinating with the angels who maintained the magical apparatuses for both placement and maintenance. When each of the Heavenly representatives on Earth had Fallen, Khizir had been tasked with retracing their final days.  
在拉夫被送到地球之前，哈齐尔一直是一个观察者。纳纳埃尔是另一个观察者。他们两个人将地球按半球分割，整理地球观测文件，并与维护魔法装置的天使协调安置和维护工作。当地球上的每个天堂代表堕落时，哈齐尔被委托追溯他们的最后日子。

The common thread hadn’t been hard to find. Vehuel and Mebahiah had had lengthy conversations with Azazel right before they’d gone silent, a silence that had ended with public confrontations with Gabriel. Poyel had also talked with Azazel before trying some sort of human beverage, and then taken the demon out of aether’s view. Whatever had happened behind those closed doors had angered the Almighty greatly. God hadn’t even waited for whatever happened to be dealt with by the archangels. Just an unexplained drop into hot sulphur, like Azazel.  
共同的线索并不难找到。Vehuel和Mebahiah在与Azazel进行了长时间的对话后突然沉默了下来，这段沉默以与Gabriel的公开对抗结束。Poyel也在尝试某种人类饮料之前与Azazel交谈过，然后将恶魔带出了众神的视线。在那些关闭的门后发生了什么事情，让全能者非常愤怒。上帝甚至没有等待大天使们处理发生的事情。就像Azazel一样，他们只是莫名其妙地掉进了炽热的硫磺中。

Of course Raf had volunteered to be the fourth representative on Earth. He had never sent a lesser angel against danger he wasn’t prepared to square off against himself, and Azazel was no exception.  
当然，拉夫自愿成为地球上的第四位代表。他从未派遣过一个次等天使去面对他自己无法应对的危险，而阿撒泽尔也不例外。

Gabriel had been vehemently against it. (Which was odd. He and Raf were so frequently at odds, Khizir had rather thought Gabriel would welcome the chance to get him out of Heaven). Michael and Uriel had voted with Gabriel, as ever. That would have been that, but Metatron had reluctantly conveyed God’s support for Raphael’s plan.  
加百列一直强烈反对这个计划。（这很奇怪。他和拉斐尔经常意见不合，哈齐尔原以为加百列会乐意将他赶出天堂）。迈克尔和乌列尔一如既往地支持加百列。本来事情就该这样结束了，但梅塔特隆不情愿地传达了上帝对拉斐尔计划的支持。

Coordinating maintenance schedules and coordinating a department’s schedules weren’t that different, Raf had said, and both Khizir and Nanael had the best sense of perspective from having seen human history secondhand. Zephon and Nakir had been assigned the maintenance scheduling. Khizir and Nanael had been promoted to assistant supervisors for the department. While Raphael would do as much as he could remotely, most of the day-to-day tasks would fall to the two of them. They weren’t to let Sandalphon bully them into second-guessing themselves, and if they had problems with Gabriel, Raf would be back as soon as they asked.  
协调维护计划和协调部门日程，Raf曾说过，两者并没有太大的区别。Khizir和Nanael从间接地了解人类历史中获得了最好的洞察力。Zephon和Nakir被分配到维护计划安排的工作。Khizir和Nanael被提升为部门的助理主管。尽管Raphael会尽力远程协助，但大部分日常任务将由他们两个来完成。他们不应该让Sandalphon欺负他们，如果他们与Gabriel有问题，只要他们提出，Raf就会立即回来。

Then he’d left to face Azazel’s magic.  
然后他离开去面对阿撒泽尔的魔法。

Gabriel and Uriel had started huffing about decorum and formality and discipline not twenty-four Earth-hours afterward.  
不到地球时间二十四小时，加百列和乌列尔就开始对礼仪、形式和纪律大发牢骚。

Khizir and Nanael had ignored them. They had instructions, you see, Nanael said.  
Khizir和Nanael忽略了他们。你知道的，他们有指示，Nanael说道。

Khizir would have ignored Gabriel and his lackeys even without instructions. Angels were specialized, built to fulfill a specific role from the inside out. No angel from one order would ever be able to notice or dream up what an angel from a different order would. Listening to each other, being connected to each other -- it was essential for any kind of efficient problem solving. Heaven needed efficiency more than ever, with half the Host Fallen or dead. You couldn’t have cooperation without trust, and there was more trust where there was fondness. Raf had his quarter of Heaven working the way it ought – the way, in Khizir’s opinion, God preferred it to be run. Khizir wasn’t about to tear that apart just because Gabriel wanted to double-down on being wrong.  
即使没有指示，Khizir也会无视Gabriel和他的走狗。天使们各有专长，从内到外都被设计用来履行特定的角色。不同阶级的天使永远无法注意到或想象出其他阶级的天使所能做到的事情。彼此倾听、相互联系对于高效解决问题至关重要。天堂比以往任何时候都更需要高效率，因为一半的天使已经堕落或死亡。没有信任就没有合作，而喜爱之处就有更多的信任。Raf让他所负责的天堂区域按照应有的方式运转，这在Khizir看来，也是上帝所偏爱的方式。Khizir不会因为Gabriel想要坚持错误而破坏这一切。

And he was wrong. Khizir knew it. She could _prove_ it. She had facts, figures, quotes from Metatron’s human mouthpieces, even a few quotes from the Almighty directly.  
而他错了。Khizir知道这一点。她可以证明这一点。她有事实、数据、来自Metatron的人类代言人的引用，甚至还有一些来自全能者直接的引用。

But Gabriel, Michael, and Uriel would never listen to her. She was only an Authority, two ranks below even Gabriel’s Dominion sycophant, Sandalphon. The archangels didn’t even listen to Raf, and he was one of them. They believed Heaven was not a place for feeling, for individuality, for connection, for hope. Just celestial cogs in a well-oiled war machine.  
但是加百列、米迦勒和乌列尔从不听她的话。她只是一个权威，甚至比加百列的统治者奴才桑达尔冯还要低两个级别。大天使们甚至不听拉夫的话，而他们中的一员。他们认为天堂不是一个有感情、个性、联系和希望的地方。只是一个润滑良好的战争机器中的天体齿轮。

There was so much more to being an angel than war. Khizir knew it. Raf and Nanael knew it. Most of their department could see the hazy outline of what being an angel really was, as if in an old Roman mirror. But outside that? Everyone was too blinded by blind obedience, by tradition, by the way things were always done, by the threat of Falling.  
成为天使远不止战争那么简单，哈齐尔明白这一点。拉夫和纳纳埃尔也明白。他们部门的大多数人能够模糊地看到成为天使的真正意义，就像在一面古罗马镜子中一样。但在外面呢？每个人都被盲目服从、传统、一成不变的方式以及堕落的威胁所蒙蔽。

If Raf Fell, without his authority backing Khizir and Nanael--  
如果拉夫失势，没有他的权威支持，基兹尔和娜娜艾尔也会受到影响--

What they had, pale imitation of what could be that it was, would fall apart. Gabriel wouldn’t hesitate to put Sandalphon in Raf’s place. For all Khizir knew, he’d tried already but Raf had shot him down in favor of Khizir and Nanael.  
他们所拥有的，只是可想象的苍白模仿，注定会瓦解。加百列毫不犹豫地会将桑达尔芬置于拉夫的位置上。至于哈齐尔所知，他可能已经尝试过，但拉夫却选择了哈齐尔和娜娜埃尔。

Khizir was currently on Earth. She’d told Nanael she had to kip down to Earth for a quick meeting with Raf before office hours.  
Khizir目前正在地球上。她告诉Nanael她必须在上班时间之前和Raf进行一个快速会议。

Humans were forever getting into disagreements over bone structure and melanin content. At the moment, the English were vehemently opposed to Middle Eastern and Egyptian descent. The English considered them fit only to provide manual labor at far-away dig sites -- even as wealthy English citizenry gobbled up every Egyptian, Syrian, and Babylonian antiquity they could get their hands on. They were even going so far as to chisel the noses off said antiquities so the statues would look more like statues of Caucasians.  
人类总是在骨骼结构和黑色素含量上产生争议。目前，英国人对中东和埃及血统持强烈反对态度。英国人认为他们只适合在遥远的挖掘现场提供体力劳动，尽管富有的英国公民却疯狂收购埃及、叙利亚和巴比伦的古物。他们甚至去刻意破坏这些古物的鼻子，使它们看起来更像高加索人的雕像。

Khizir wasn’t human, but her corporation had golden-brown skin, dark hair, and a wide-set facial-bone structure. Dealing with petty human prejudices didn’t appeal, so Khizir had spent a miracle on a general glamour of goodwill among the races spreading out in a sixty-foot vicinity from her corporation. It would keep her from being accosted by either hostility or being treated like a curiosity.  
Khizir不是人类，但她的公司有着金棕色的皮肤、黑色的头发和宽大的面部骨骼结构。应对琐碎的人类偏见并不吸引她，所以Khizir在她的公司周围六十英尺范围内施展了一种奇迹般的善意魅力，以在各个种族中传播友好。这将使她免受敌意的侵扰，也不会被当作奇特的对象对待。

Of course, that wouldn’t stop humans from being difficult for other reasons. Apparently someone dressed like a shop-girl and trying to order a drink by its description instead of its name wasn’t something the waiter at this cafe felt like he should be dealing with this morning.  
当然，这并不能阻止人们因其他原因而变得困难。显然，有人打扮得像店员，试图通过描述来点一杯饮料，而不是用它的名字，这对于这家咖啡馆的服务员来说，今天早上并不是他愿意应付的事情。

“Listen,” Khizir stated. “I don’t know what it’s called, but it’s red and a little sweet, but not too sweet. It comes in a bottle topped by a round bit of bark you shove in the top.” Raf usually had human treats for those who had in-person appointments, sweet bits of flavored matter or strange liquids with a variety of tastes. She’d never learned the name of the one she liked, Raf just poured it when she showed up.  
“听着，”Khizir说道。“我不知道它叫什么名字，但它是红色的，有点甜，但不是太甜。它装在一个瓶子里，瓶盖上有一块圆形的树皮，你要把它塞进瓶口。”对于那些亲自前来的人，Raf通常会准备一些人类的零食，甜甜的味道或者各种口味的奇怪液体。她从来没有了解过她喜欢的那种饮料的名字，Raf只是在她出现时候倒给她喝。

“It’s a little early for wine, miss,” the waiter said primly. “As I said before, perhaps a nice cup of tea--”  
“小姐，现在喝酒有点早了。” 服务员端庄地说道。“就像我之前说的，也许来一杯好茶--”

“Just bring it. Please.” 就带过来吧。拜托。

Just when she thought she was going to have to spend another miracle on compliance (and file a report on herself when she got back to Heaven), the waiter left.  
就在她以为自己又要花费一个奇迹来遵守规定（并在回到天堂后向自己报告）的时候，服务员离开了。

Khizir opened the file folder in her hands. The Observation File picture within was why she wanted the red stuff-- wine. The wine. She would remember now.  
开西尔打开了她手中的文件夹。里面的观察文件照片就是她想要的红色东西——酒。那瓶酒。现在她会记得的。

Raf flexed between male and female presentation as the task at hand warranted, even if for office hours he stuck with a masculine suit. In the photo he was wearing female clothes. His spindly limbs and pointed face made the lack of breasts look normal. Humans always thought he was whatever he presented as. Khizir’s curved corporation couldn’t pull off the same flexibility without considerably more effort.  
Raf根据需要在男性和女性之间切换形象，即使在办公时间里，他也会穿着男性西装。照片中，他穿着女性服装。他纤细的四肢和尖锐的面容使得没有胸部看起来很正常。人们总是认为他是他所呈现的形象。Khizir的身材曲线无法像Raf那样灵活自如，除非付出更多的努力。

She couldn’t see the appeal of female presentation, herself. Raf could not be wearing this much cloth and put this many pins in his hair just to look pretty, except Raf absolutely would.  
她自己无法理解女性打扮的吸引力。Raf不可能穿这么多衣服，把这么多发夹插在头发里只是为了好看，但Raf却完全会这样做。

The waiter set the glass of red on her table. Khizir waved him away and took a drink. It was a lot less sweet than the one Raf usually gave her, but the same basic flavor. It was-- oddly comforting.  
服务员将一杯红酒放在她的桌子上。Khizir挥手示意他离开，然后喝了一口。这杯酒没有Raf通常给她的那么甜，但味道基本相同。这种感觉有些奇怪，但令人安心。

The photograph hadn’t driven Khizir from Heaven because of Raf’s sartorial choices, questionable though they were. The problem was that Raf’s ornate hair had a snake-shaped pin in it. Azazel had put it there, and in the photo he was arranging Raf’s red curls around the gift. Snake-themed jewelry was all the rage among British humans right now. Raf’s feminine presentations had several pieces that circled neck or wrist, or were pinned to the clothes.  
这张照片并不是因为Raf的服装选择而让Khizir离开天堂，尽管这些选择有些可疑。问题在于Raf华丽的发型上别着一枚蛇形别针。这是Azazel放在那里的，照片中他正在整理Raf红色的卷发，围绕着这份礼物。蛇主题的珠宝是英国人最近非常流行的。Raf女性化的形象有几件围绕着脖子或手腕的饰品，或者别在衣服上。

A hundred years ago, Azazel had enacted a major spell to save seventy-four human children from the Revolution. It hadn’t made sense then, a demon rescuing humans.  
一百年前，阿撒泽尔施展了一项重大咒语，拯救了七十四个人类孩子免于革命的危险。当时这样做似乎毫无道理，一个恶魔竟然在拯救人类。

The photo-- Well, the photo suggested a motive, didn’t it? Raf hadn’t paid any heed to Azazel’s head games for twelve hundred years. As far as Khizir could tell, he just ignored them. But seventy-four human lives, gifted on a platter? That wasn’t something Raf would ignore.  
这张照片——嗯，这张照片暗示了一个动机，不是吗？拉夫已经对阿撒泽尔的心理游戏置之不理了整整一千二百年。据可得知，他只是无视它们。但是，七十四条人命，就这样送上来？那可不是拉夫会无视的事情。

Khizir turned the photograph over. She had consulted with Intelligence and asked them to pull records on any temptations since 1793 A.D. which had resulted in a net reduction in human suffering. The file was as thick as her pinkie finger.  
吉齐尔翻过照片。她与情报部门商议过，并要求他们查找自1793年以来，任何导致人类苦难减少的诱惑的记录。那个文件厚度与她的小指一样。

That was when Khizir had decided she wanted to consume human drink while she read it. She had finished the glass by the time she finished the file. She had also changed the mind of a different waiter who had tried to ask her questions about Damascus and wouldn’t accept the answer that Khizir hadn’t been near the cradle of civilization in centuries.  
那是Khizir决定在阅读时喝人类饮料的时候。她在读完文件之前已经喝完了杯子里的饮料。她还改变了另一位侍者的想法，他试图问她有关大马士革的问题，但不接受Khizir已经几个世纪没有接近文明摇篮的答案。

The results of Intelligence’s investigation were worse than she had imagined. Nearly a hundred temptations with net good in a hundred years. A hundred human happinesses wrapped in a bow. Khizir closed the file. And now Raf was letting the demon groom him.  
情报部门的调查结果比她想象的还要糟糕。近百年来，几乎有一百次的诱惑都以净利益告终。一百个人类的幸福被束之高阁。Khizir合上了文件。而现在，Raf正在让恶魔驯服他。

Khizir turned the empty glass round and round by the stem. Raf believed humans and angels both had choices. If anyone could be tricked into believing a demon could be redeemed, it would be Raf.  
吉齐尔用杯柄把空杯子转来转去。拉夫相信人类和天使都有选择权。如果有人能被骗以为恶魔可以被救赎，那一定是拉夫。

Khizir could simply talk to Raf, of course. She could lay out the math and her concerns, explain what a disaster it would be for all of them in Heaven if he Fell. Raf would listen. Even if he didn’t agree, even if he believed that Azazel could be saved in some way, he would never put the attempt above the welfare of his staff. He’d be cautious, distant.  
当然，Khizir可以直接与Raf交谈。她可以清楚地阐述数学和她的担忧，解释如果他堕落对他们在天堂的所有人来说将是一场灾难。Raf会倾听。即使他不同意，即使他相信Azazel可以以某种方式被拯救，他也永远不会将这个尝试置于员工的福祉之上。他会谨慎而保持距离。

Khizir had watched Vehuel and Mebahiah – _especially_ Mebahiah – use the same caution in the years prior to their Falls. All it had done was slow Azazel down. Once Azazel got his claws in...  
Khizir曾经目睹Vehuel和Mebahiah在他们堕落前的几年里都非常谨慎，尤其是Mebahiah。但这只是让Azazel的行动变得缓慢而已。一旦Azazel开始行动...

Azazel knew where Raf was soft, now. If this, this playing nice didn’t work, he’d just try something else, Khizir was certain of it.  
阿撒谢尔现在知道拉夫的软肋了。如果这种和善的方式不起作用，他肯定会尝试其他方法，哈齐尔对此深信不疑。

No, Azazel had to be dealt with _permanently._ Gabriel and the rest of them would never sanction it. Too much paperwork, too much risk of starting a war with Hell before the Almighty gave the word to start Armageddon. If she did this, there could be nothing tracing back to Heaven, nothing official. There was simply too much to lose.  
不，阿撒泽尔必须被永久解决。加百列和其他人绝不会批准这样做。太多的文书工作，太多的风险会在全能者下令开始末日战争之前与地狱开战。如果她这样做了，就不能有任何与天堂有关的痕迹，没有任何官方记录。简直是太多东西要失去了。

Hopefully the Almighty agreed, or she’d be Azazel’s last bit of legacy.  
希望全能者同意，否则她将成为阿撒泽尔最后的遗产。

Her mind made up, Khizir pulled out a map and a pen from the aether. The demon had to have a home base of some form. She just had to triangulate it.  
下定决心后，Khizir从虚空中拿出一张地图和一支笔。恶魔一定有一个基地，她只需要三角定位出来。

Raphael bolted upright in the bed. His heart didn’t strictly need to carry blood through his body, but it was pounding anyway. The clock on Azazel’s dresser read nearly nine o’clock and the room was in total darkness. He’d only been asleep for an hour, why was he awake?  
拉斐尔从床上突然坐起来。他的心脏虽然不需要通过身体输送血液，但它仍然急速跳动着。阿撒泽尔梳妆台上的时钟显示将近九点，房间里一片漆黑。他才睡了一个小时，为什么会醒来呢？

There was a loud crash from downstairs.  
楼下传来一声巨响。

“I am entirely certain this isn’t sanctioned,” Azazel’s voice said, tight with fear and trying to soothe, “so let’s take a moment to consider before you do anything rash.” There was another crash. “That was the definition of rash!”  
“我完全确定这是不被批准的，”阿撒泽尔的声音紧张而又试图安抚地说道，“所以在你做出任何冲动的举动之前，让我们花点时间考虑一下。”又是一声巨响。“那就是冲动的定义！”

Raphael rolled out of the bed Azazel had obtained solely because of Raphael, dressing with a miracle as he moved. He ripped the heavy curtain rod down from the window, tipping it this way and that to slough off the heavy brocade curtains. Raphael wasn’t much for hand-to-hand, more sorcerer than fighter, but with Azazel in the fray a smite or throwing holy water was simply too dangerous. Swinging a holy weapon about was just as bad. Impact from a curtain rod would damage Azazel’s corporation, but it could be healed with a snap of Azazel’s fingers as long as there was no fatal trauma. A holy weapon would damage Azazel’s actual form. The damage his corporation manifested would be sympathetic to the real injuries. No magic could short-cut that healing and a fatal blow would be fatal entirely.  
拉斐尔从阿撒泽尔为他特意准备的床上滚了下来，一边移动一边神奇地穿上衣服。他从窗户上撕下沉重的窗帘杆，左右摇晃着将厚重的织锦窗帘甩掉。拉斐尔并不擅长肉搏战，更像是一个法师而不是战士，但是在阿撒泽尔参与战斗时，使用神圣武器或者扔圣水就太危险了。挥舞神圣武器同样糟糕。窗帘杆的冲击会损伤阿撒泽尔的实体，但只要没有致命的创伤，他可以轻松用手指一弹就能治愈。而神圣武器会损伤阿撒泽尔的真实形态。他的实体所表现出的伤害会与真实伤势相对应。没有魔法可以快速治愈这种伤害，致命的一击将会完全致命。

Raphael pulled the door open and ran down the narrow hallway, makeshift staff held parallel to the ground. The stairwell was too narrow to drop down with his wings, damn British architecture-- Raphael used the railing for a counter-balance, jumping down the stairs four at a time--  
拉斐尔拉开门，沿着狭窄的走廊跑去，手中临时制作的法杖平行地握着。楼梯太窄了，无法展开翅膀下降，该死的英国建筑——拉斐尔利用扶手作为平衡，一次跳下四级楼梯——

Azazel threw a side-table at his opponent, the books piled on it flying every which way. His forearms were bleeding from defensive wounds, deep gashes and one puncture wound.  
阿撒谢尔朝他的对手扔了一张边桌，上面堆放的书四处飞扬。他的前臂因为防御时受伤而流血，有深深的划痕和一个刺伤口。

His assailant wasn’t a demon. It was Khizir. She took the side-table’s impact without flinching, grabbing the wash basin and blessing at the same time. She threw it.  
他的袭击者并不是恶魔，而是哈齐尔。她毫不畏惧地承受着小桌子的冲击，同时拿起洗脸盆并祈祷。她将它扔了出去。

Raphael halted the molecular motion of the water as if it was a nebula. The poison spray hung in the air even as he shouted, “Enough!”  
拉斐尔停止了水分子的运动，就像它是一团星云。毒雾在空中弥漫，即使他大喊：“够了！”

Azazel scrambled to the side to avoid the arc and onto a small bookshelf to avoid the puddle that would form when the water landed. Raphael jumped over the bannister, spreading his wings in the narrow living room and letting loose the molecules. The holy water splashed over his wings. Azazel, his table, and his vocal estimations of Raphael’s low intelligence were hidden behind him.  
阿撒泽尔急忙躲到一边以避开电弧，然后跳到一个小书架上以避免水落地时形成的水坑。拉斐尔跳过栏杆，在狭窄的客厅里展开翅膀，释放出分子。圣水溅在他的翅膀上。阿撒泽尔、他的桌子以及他对拉斐尔智商低下的评估都被他遮住了。

“Raf, get out of the way,” Khizir said, her dagger drawn up.  
"Raf，让开，" Khizir 说道，她拔出了匕首。

“Azazel, take a walk.” It came out far more supervisory than Raphael intended.  
“阿撒泽尔，出去走走。” 拉斐尔的语气比他本意中更加监督。

“You cannot possibly be serious,” Azazel began.  
“你不可能是认真的，”阿撒泽尔开始说道。

“Now.”  现在。

Azazel teleported away. Raphael knew he’d pay for that later, with interest. It couldn’t be helped. Khizir lowered her weapon.  
阿撒泽尔传送离开了。拉斐尔知道他以后会为此付出代价，而且还会带来利息。这是无可避免的。哈齐尔放下了武器。

“I know,” Raphael stated, folding his wings away, “that I am not the best example in following the chain of command. But I am certainly entitled to an explanation.”  
“我知道。”拉斐尔说着，将他的翅膀收起来，“我知道我并不是最好的遵守命令链的榜样。但我当然有权利得到一个解释。”

Khizir sheathed her weapon, her chin lifted in un-repentance.  
奇兹尔将武器插入鞘中，她高昂的下巴表达出无悔的态度。

“If you Fall because of Azazel, then Gabriel gets a carte blanche to interfere with the department as much as he likes. Not that Azazel has any reason to care for the quality of Heaven. You’re just another Fallen feather in his wing to him.  
如果你因为阿撒泽尔而堕落，那么加百列就有充分的理由干涉部门的事务。并不是阿撒泽尔会在乎天堂的品质。对他来说，你只是他翅膀上的又一个堕落的羽毛。

“I saw him giving you the pin, Raf, and you let him _groom you_ when you took it. I know about the last hundred years, the temptations with blessings on the side. I know about the Bastille. But I also knew if I told you that he was playing you, even if you were more careful afterwards, Azazel would just find another way like he did before. So I decided to take care of it. I didn’t expect you to be here.” Khizir crossed the distance and grabbed the hand not holding a curtain rod in her own. Her dark eyes were pleading. “Raf, you need to let me kill him. Please. There’s too much at stake. You can’t be reckless like this.”  
“我看到他给你那个别针，拉夫，你接过来的时候还让他梳理你。我知道过去一百年发生的事情，那些带着附带祝福的诱惑。我知道巴士底狱的事情。但我也知道，即使我告诉你他在利用你，即使你之后更加小心，阿撒泽尔会找到另一种方式，就像他以前做过的那样。所以我决定处理这件事。我没想到你会在这里。”哈齐尔走过来，抓住了另一只没有拿着窗帘杆的手。她的深邃眼眸充满了恳求。“拉夫，你必须让我杀了他。拜托了。太多事情牵扯其中。你不能这么鲁莽。”

Azazel called him reckless all the time. Cautioned him against getting caught, set an endless series of rules for what they could and could not do (no kissing, no oral sex, penetration only with fingers, only one of them making an effort at the time, never less than partially-dressed), rules so strict that he’d teleport away and ignore Raphael for twenty years if Raphael even tried to push even one boundary a little. Anything to keep Raphael from Falling.  
阿撒泽尔总是称他为鲁莽。警告他不要被抓住，制定了一系列无尽的规则，规定了他们可以做什么和不能做什么（不能接吻，不能口交，只能用手指进行插入，每次只能有一人付出努力，从不完全脱衣），规则如此严格，以至于如果拉斐尔试图稍微突破一条边界，他会瞬间传送离开并忽视拉斐尔二十年。为了防止拉斐尔堕落，不惜一切。

And here Khizir was, committing an unsanctioned extinction that would get her chucked headfirst out of Heaven if she were discovered, because there was even a chance his wings might tarnish.  
而在这里，Khizir正在进行一次未经批准的灭绝行动，如果被发现的话，她将被直接赶出天堂，因为甚至有可能他的翅膀会被玷污。

The room was a ruin, books and broken wood and shattered pottery lying strewn across the carpeted wood floor, spattered in red demon blood and holy water. It was dark outside, the room lit only by moonlight. Azazel didn’t need lanterns or candles to see.  
房间已经成了一片废墟，书籍、破碎的木头和破碎的陶器散落在铺着地毯的木地板上，上面洒满了红色的恶魔血和圣水。外面很黑，房间只有月光照亮。阿撒泽尔不需要灯笼或蜡烛来看清楚。

Raphael turned to lean the curtain rod against the wall to buy time.  
拉斐尔转身将窗帘杆靠在墙上，争取时间。

“How far back did you look for temptings with blessings on the side?” he asked.  
他问道：“你追溯到多久以前寻找带有祝福的诱惑？”

“To the first, the Bastille,” Khizir said.  
“对于第一个问题，巴士底狱，”Khizir说道。

He could tell her the truth, that the temptations were his. If he was ever caught by Heaven, though, Khizir would go down with him as an accomplice. But she couldn’t be faulted for believing her superior’s lies. Azazel had departed when Raphael had insisted, which was a start, seeds of a lie that was growing in the back of Raphael’s mind and dripping onto his tongue.  
他可以告诉她真相，诱惑是他的。如果他被天堂发现，Khizir将会作为共犯一同受罚。但她不能因为相信上司的谎言而受责备。当拉斐尔坚持时，阿撒泽尔已经离开了，这是一个开始，一个谎言的种子在拉斐尔脑海中生长，并滴落在他的舌尖上。

“That’s sloppy investigating,” Raphael said, turning back to his subordinate. “You made a hypothesis and you looked for the data to support it. You should have pulled all the data available, and then compared your theory to that. The first temptation with a side-blessing was in 1550.”  
“这是草率的调查，”拉斐尔转身对他的下属说道。“你提出了一个假设，然后寻找数据来支持它。你应该先收集所有可用的数据，然后将你的理论与之进行比较。第一个有附加祝福的诱惑出现在1550年。”

“So he’s been at it a little longer,” Khizir argued. “That doesn’t change anything.”  
"所以他做得时间长一点，" Khizir 争辩道。"这并不改变任何事情。"

Raphael covered Khizir’s hand in his own.  
拉斐尔把自己的手覆盖在哈齐尔的手上。

“Khizir, listen to me. You don’t like how Heaven is being run. We both know it. Up until now, you’ve only shared your reservations with me. That can’t change. I get away with getting in Gabriel’s face because-- I don’t know why. But you _won’t_. As far as _anyone_ in Heaven can know, you are only following my lead because the chain of command demands it. And if I get caught, you didn’t know anything. You thought Gabriel had approved it all. Do you understand me?”  
"Khizir，听我说。你不喜欢天堂的管理方式，我们都知道。到目前为止，你只向我表达了你的保留意见。这一点不能改变。我可以对加百列放肆，因为……我不知道为什么。但你不能。在天堂的任何人眼中，你只是按照我的指示行事，因为命令链要求如此。如果我被抓到，你什么都不知道。你以为加百列已经批准了一切。明白我的意思吗？"

Khizir’s eyes went wide. She considered, reconsidered, and considered again before speaking.  
哈齐尔的眼睛瞪大了。她思考了一下，又重新考虑了一下，然后再次考虑后才开口说话。

“He’s your asset,” she breathed. “You’re doing-- you’re managing the humans through _him_, but demons can’t bless they can only-- tempt. Is that why-- has he been-- your inside man this entire time?”  
“他是你的财富，”她喃喃道。“你通过他来管理人类，但恶魔不能祝福，只能引诱。这就是为什么——他一直是你的内线吗？”

“You don’t know that,” Raphael said sharply. “If I have Azazel, it’s safe to assume that Hell has someone in Heaven.”  
“你不知道这个，”拉斐尔尖锐地说道。“如果我有阿撒泽尔，可以肯定地说地狱也有人在天堂。”

Khizir released Raphael to clap her hands over her mouth.  
Khizir 释放了拉斐尔，让她捂住嘴巴鼓掌。

“I didn’t tell anyone, not even Nanael, that I was coming here,” she said, her voice muffled by her hands.  
她说：“我没有告诉任何人，甚至是娜娜艾尔，我要来这里。”她的声音被双手遮住，听起来有些沉闷。

Well, that was something.  
嗯，那真是一件事。

“Raf, if Hell finds out-- Gabriel won’t lift a finger, not even one, never. How are you going to keep Azazel from giving you up to save himself?”  
“Raf，如果地狱发现了——加百列连动一根手指头都不会，绝对不会。你打算如何阻止阿撒泽尔出卖你来保全自己？”

Azazel wouldn’t, but Khizir wouldn’t believe that. Hell finding out though-- Raphael had been so confident Hell _wouldn’t_ discover the arrangement. But if Khizir had figured them out, then a demon might, and he’d need some kind of insurance for Azazel.  
阿撒谢尔不会这样做，但哈齐尔不会相信。地狱发现了——拉斐尔曾如此自信地认为地狱不会发现这个安排。但如果哈齐尔已经发现了他们，那么一个恶魔也可能发现，他需要为阿撒谢尔提供某种保险。

“I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it. You’re right about reckless.”  
我会等到真正面临问题时再解决。你说得对，我确实有些鲁莽。

Khizir moved her arms awkwardly, stepping forward and back twice. Finally her arms closed around Raphael’s upper arms, her chin hooked over his shoulder.  
Khizir笨拙地挪动着她的双臂，前后踉跄了两次。最后，她的双臂终于紧紧地搂住了Raphael的上臂，她的下巴勾在他的肩膀上。

Human sisters did this to their older brothers. Some of the aristocrats had done it to the Pimpernel, human or angelic. Angels didn’t have any gesture similar, of course she’d had to borrow the humans’.  
人类的姐妹们对待他们的哥哥们就是这样。一些贵族对待了派珀内尔，无论是人类还是天使。天使当然没有类似的动作，所以她不得不借用人类的。

“Raf, you can’t get caught. You just can’t,” Khizir stated.  
"Raf，你不能被抓住。你绝对不能被抓住，" Khizir 说道。

“I have no plans in that direction,” Raphael said. It was all true. It was all a lie. It was the first lie of commission he’d ever told Khizir. Khizir who trusted, who followed his lead, and who believed Heaven could be better. Should be better.  
“我对那个方向没有计划。”拉斐尔说道。这一切都是真的。这一切都是谎言。这是他第一次对哈齐尔撒谎。哈齐尔是个信任他、追随他、相信天堂可以更好、应该更好的人。

If he closed his eyes, just for a moment, Raphael could believe the lie was true. It didn’t help. It was one more falsehood on the pile, slung on next to the lies to Gabriel, Uriel, Michael, even God. The only person he didn’t lie to was Azazel. Azazel lied enough to Raphael for the both of them: that this was just temptation, just an arrangement, that demons couldn’t feel love at all and that Raphael couldn’t care for a demon, that they had nothing in common. Lies so fervent Azazel could almost believe them, and if a demon could pray, lies Azazel prayed the Almighty believed as well.  
如果他闭上眼睛，只是一瞬间，拉斐尔可以相信谎言是真的。这没有帮助。这只是堆积在一起的更多谎言之一，与加百列、乌列、米迦勒甚至上帝的谎言并列。他唯一没有对其撒谎的人是阿撒泽尔。阿撒泽尔对拉斐尔撒了足够多的谎言：这只是诱惑，只是一种安排，恶魔根本不能感受爱，拉斐尔不可能关心一个恶魔，他们没有任何共同之处。这些谎言如此热切，以至于阿撒泽尔几乎相信它们，如果恶魔能够祈祷的话，阿撒泽尔会祈祷全能者也相信这些谎言。

Satan was the Father of the Lie. When Khizir released him and set Azazel’s living room to rights with a wave of her hand, Raphael couldn’t imagine why he wasn’t Fallen already.  
撒旦是谎言之父。当Khizir释放了他，并用手一挥将Azazel的客厅整理好时，拉斐尔无法想象为什么他还没有堕落。

Raphael gave Azazel his insurance three days later, in a sealed metal canteen. Glass and ceramic were too risky if Azazel dropped them accidentally.  
拉斐尔在三天后给了阿撒泽尔他的保险，放在一个密封的金属水壶里。如果阿撒泽尔不小心掉了，玻璃和陶瓷都太危险了。

“I am not dousing myself in a- a- suicide pill the minute you’re through with me!” Azazel spat, fussy and furious. The threw his bread at the ducks all at once in preparation for putting his hat on and leaving.  
“你等我用完就不要再给我灌自杀药了！”阿撒泽尔气愤地吐了口唾沫。他一下子把面包扔给了鸭子，准备戴上帽子离开。

“It’s a _weapon_, hellfire,” Raphael explained. “You unscrew the cap, throw it at the other bloke, and fly hard for Alpha Centauri. Plenty of extra planets up there, no one would notice you.”  
“这是一种武器，地狱之火，”拉斐尔解释道。“你拧开盖子，朝对方扔出去，然后全力飞向半人马座阿尔法星。那边有很多额外的行星，没人会注意到你。”

Azazel paused mid-rant. He slowly reached out for the canteen. “Oh,” he said softly.  
阿撒谢尔停下了他的抱怨。他慢慢地伸手去拿水壶。“哦，”他轻声说道。

After a moment, he continued, “If you’re caught, you could run, too, you know.”  
过了一会儿，他继续说道：“如果你被抓住了，你也可以逃跑，你知道的。”

“No.” Raphael watched the ducks swim along the water, the swans eating across the way. “Whatever happens, I have to confess that I lied to my people and they knew nothing. I can’t do that if I run.”  
“不。”拉斐尔看着鸭子在水中游动，天鹅在对面吃东西。“无论发生什么，我必须承认我对我的人民撒了谎，而他们一无所知。如果我逃跑，我无法做到这一点。”

“Well, yes, that’s very noble, but surely--”  
“嗯，是的，那确实非常高尚，但是--”

“It’s not open for discussion, hellfire. You’ve never been responsible for anyone but yourself.”  
这个问题不容讨论，地狱火。你从来没有为别人负责过。

Azazel was offended. He huffed about ungrateful angels and not needing Raphael’s companionship, and he stormed away, but he took the holy water with him. It’d blow over in fifty years or so. It always did. Raphael didn’t move from the water’s edge.  
阿撒泽尔感到被冒犯了。他嘟囔着不感激的天使和不需要拉斐尔的陪伴，然后气冲冲地离开了，但他带走了圣水。大约五十年后，这一切都会过去的。它总是会过去的。拉斐尔没有离开水边。

The Pimpernel had warned him it would feel like this, a century ago. He still did, whenever Raphael stopped by for a chat in Heaven. The warning didn’t make it feel any less crushing, or less terribly alone.

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Ascending the stairs to Heaven with Raphael was…  
与拉斐尔一起登上通往天堂的楼梯是..

He wasn’t Crowley. Raphael had never been the Prometheus in Eden or Crawly in Hell. The angel standing next to him hadn’t smuggled human children aboard the Ark or shown Jesus the world before his death. He wasn’t forgiven because he’d never been condemned in the first place. Aziraphale knew that. He did.  
他不是克劳利。拉斐尔从未是伊甸园的普罗米修斯，也不是地狱中的克劳利。站在他旁边的天使从未在方舟上走私人类儿童，也没有在耶稣死前向他展示过世界。他没有被原谅，因为他从一开始就没有被定罪。阿齐拉费尔知道这一点。他确实知道。

But he looked like Crowley, and there was just enough similarity that Aziraphale’s largely-decorative heart ached when they ascended the stairs.  
但他看起来像克劳利，而且有足够的相似之处，让阿齐拉费尔的大部分装饰性心脏在他们上楼时感到疼痛。

Heaven looked different in this timeline. It was still open architecture lines and bright lights, populated by quiet angels in neutral tones and pale pastels. But there were several angels in the milieu with bright accents: bold ties and scarves, vibrant shirts and shoes. The colorful angels were friendlier than usual with each other, while most of the regularly-dressed angels hurried by. A few of the quiet ones smiled too brightly or waved too vigorously, but no more.  
在这个时间线上，天堂看起来有些不同。它仍然是开放式的建筑线条和明亮的灯光，由穿着中性色调和淡雅色彩的安静天使所居住。但是在这个环境中，有几个天使身上有着鲜艳的装饰：大胆的领带和围巾，充满活力的衬衫和鞋子。这些色彩缤纷的天使彼此之间比平常更友好，而大多数穿着普通服装的天使匆匆走过。一些安静的天使微笑得过于明亮，或者挥手过于热烈，但也不再多了。

“Oh my God,” an angel exclaimed on seeing Aziraphale, dropping the files she was carrying. Aziraphale didn’t recognize her. She had dark hair and dark eyes, wearing a bright purple shirt with her gray pant-suit. “Raf, I know I said-- I didn’t imagine--” The strange angel put both her arms around Aziraphale. “Welcome back.”  
“我的天啊！”一个天使看到阿齐拉费尔时惊叫一声，把她正拿着的文件掉在了地上。阿齐拉费尔没有认出她来。她有着黑色的头发和黑色的眼睛，穿着一件鲜艳的紫色衬衫和灰色的西装裤。“拉夫，我知道我说过的——我没想到——”这个陌生的天使双臂环绕着阿齐拉费尔。“欢迎回来。”

Aziraphale didn’t know what to do. Angels did not hug in his time. Anything more than a shoulder pat was unheard of. It wasn’t unwelcome, of course, just the most bizarre--  
亚齐拉费尔不知道该怎么办。在他那个时代，天使们不会拥抱。除了拍拍肩膀之外的任何举动都是闻所未闻的。当然，并不是不受欢迎，只是最奇怪的事情--

“That’s not Azazel,” Raphael said, putting a hand on the other angel’s shoulder. She stepped back. “Gabriel’s been mucking with time. That’s Aziraphale, never Fallen, from another timeline. Gabriel accidentally made a demon version of me we’re going to run into, fair warning for that. Aziraphale, Khizir.”  
“那不是阿撒泽勒，”拉斐尔说着，一只手放在另一个天使的肩膀上。她退后了一步。“加百列搞乱了时间。那是阿齐拉费尔，从另一个时间线上，从未堕落。加百列无意中制造了一个恶魔版本的我，我们将会遇到，提前警告一下。阿齐拉费尔，哈齐尔。”

“You don’t mess with time,” Khizir said incredulously. “You have no way of knowing if anyone else has before-- why would you ever risk--”  
"你可别玩弄时间，" Khizir 不可思议地说道。"你根本不知道是否有其他人曾经这样做过，为什么要冒险呢？"

“I know, and we’ve got to fix it. Come on.” Raphael snapped his fingers and the files on the ground disappeared. The bulk of the angels were lining up for the quartermaster, getting arms and armor for the battle ahead. Raphael led Khizir and Aziraphale around the line, headed for the suspended globe in the center of Heaven. Raphael outlined their theory about Gabriel’s note-to-past-self and the broad sketches of their plan to fix it.  
“我知道，我们必须解决这个问题。走吧。”拉斐尔响了响手指，地上的文件消失了。大部分天使都在排队等待军需官，为即将到来的战斗获取武器和盔甲。拉斐尔带领着哈齐尔和阿齐拉费尔绕过队伍，朝着天堂中心的悬浮地球前进。拉斐尔概述了他们关于加百列给过去自己的便条以及修复计划的大致草图。

“Raf,” Khizir said, halting half-way and grabbing her superior by the arm. “If what you’re saying is true, then these other yous aren’t dopplegangers. They’re holdovers from the previous timeline.”  
“Raf，” Khizir说道，停下来并抓住她的上司的胳膊。“如果你所说的是真的，那么这些其他的你们不是影子人。他们是来自之前时间线的残留。”

“The correct timeline,” Raphael said crisply, taking Khizir’s arm to urge her along.  
“正确的时间表，”拉斐尔干脆地说道，拉着哈齐尔的手臂催促她前进。

Aziraphale hadn’t thought about it, too busy worrying about the world and time itself melting down into nothing. Raphael wasn’t Crowley, not in any way that mattered, but he also was Crowley in every way that could possibly matter.  
阿齐拉费尔没有考虑过这个问题，他太忙于担心世界和时间本身的消失。拉斐尔不是克劳利，至少在任何重要的方面都不是，但他也是克劳利，在任何可能重要的方面都是。

“Raf!” Khizir repeated. “You are not supposed to be Fallen. All our progress--”  
“拉夫！”哈齐尔重复道。“你不应该堕落。我们的所有进展——”

“Won’t matter if none of you exist,” Raphael implored. “I should have Fallen ten times over by now, you know that, Khizir. Now we know why I haven’t. Heaven will be all right. I promise.”  
“如果你们都不存在也无所谓，”拉斐尔恳求道。“你知道，哈齐尔，我早就应该堕落十次了。现在我们知道为什么我没有堕落。天堂会没事的。我保证。”

Aziraphale couldn’t breathe. His vision blurred. He wished, very suddenly and sharply, that Crowley was there.  
亚齐拉费尔无法呼吸。他的视线模糊。他突然而强烈地希望克劳利在那里。

He wouldn’t remember. Neither of them would, when all this was fixed.  
他不会记得的。当一切都解决了，他们两个都不会记得。

Khizir was moving again, and Raphael, too. Aziraphale watched them in his peripheral vision as he pointed his eyes upward toward the ceiling, blinked rapidly, and tried to compose himself.  
哈齐尔又开始移动了，拉斐尔也是。阿齐拉费尔用余光注视着他们，同时抬起眼睛看向天花板，快速眨眼，试图让自己冷静下来。

He had just cleared his vision when they arrived at the globe. There was a problem, standing in front of the globe in an orange suit and a slasher smile.  
他刚刚清醒过来，他们就到了地球仪前。有一个问题，站在地球仪前面，穿着橙色的衣服，露出一丝邪恶的微笑。

“The main gate will be moved to the plains of Megiddo when the Antichrist commands the four horsemen to ride,” Sandalphon stated, happier than Aziraphale had ever seen him. “Until then all travel to Earth from Heaven is closed.”  
“当反基督命令四骑士出征时，主门将被移至梅吉多平原。”桑达尔芬说道，比阿齐拉费尔曾见过的他更加开心。“在那之前，从天堂到地球的所有旅行都将关闭。”

“Stand aside, Sandalphon,” Raphael ordered. Aziraphale and Khizir stood slightly behind him. Unlike Khizir, Sandalphon didn’t recognize Aziraphale at all. Of course, with Raphael in place, Sandalphon had no reason to be as knowledgable about Hell’s Earthly representative as his counterpart in Aziraphale’s timeline.  
“让开，桑达尔冯。”拉斐尔下令。阿齐拉费尔和哈齐尔稍微站在他的后面。与哈齐尔不同，桑达尔冯根本不认识阿齐拉费尔。当然，有了拉斐尔在场，桑达尔冯没有理由像阿齐拉费尔所在时间线中的对应人物那样了解地狱的地球代表。

It made Aziraphale’s head hurt.  
这让阿齐拉费尔头疼不已。

“‘I don’t take orders from you.’” Sandalphon’s hands were clasped in front of him, as dangerous-looking as if he’d been holding a weapon. “Gabriel was very clear that you, most especially, weren’t allowed on the battlefield before it started.”  
“‘我不听你的命令。’”桑达尔冯双手紧握在胸前，看起来像是握着一把危险的武器。“加百列非常明确地说，在战斗开始之前，你尤其不被允许进入战场。”

“According to the Great Plan, I’m supposed to sound the trumpet beginning the battle,” Raphael argued. “Not Gabriel. And while we’re on the topic of things wrong with that sentence, isn’t _Michael_ supposed to be leading the four Horsemen, not the Antichrist?”  
“根据伟大的计划，我应该吹响战斗的号角，”拉斐尔争辩道。“不是加百列。而且顺便说一下，按照那句话的意思，迈克尔不是应该领导四骑士，而不是反基督吗？”

Sandalphon didn’t know what to say to that at first. He finally managed, “if the Antichrist turns over command, Michael will be leading them.”  
桑达尔芬一开始不知道该说什么。最后他勉强说道：“如果反基督交出指挥权，迈克尔将会领导他们。”

“And who said that the timing of Armageddon was no longer my purview, Gabriel or God?”  
“谁说末日的时机不再是我的职责，是加百列还是上帝？”

“Metatron approved the changes,” Sandalphon countered.  
"梅塔特隆批准了这些变动，"桑达尔芬反驳道。

Metatron had approved the changes in Aziraphale’s time because Raphael had Fallen.  
梅塔特隆批准了阿齐拉费尔的时间变动，因为拉斐尔堕落了。

But listening to Raphael, Aziraphale couldn’t help but consider that the demon Crowley, Serpent in Eden, had been the one to tell Aziraphale (and by extension Heaven) that the eleven-year count-down and begun. And like his angelic counterpart, Crowley had also been the one to declare that this Armageddon should be stopped.  
但是听着拉斐尔的话，阿齐拉费尔不禁开始考虑到，恶魔克劳利，伊甸园中的蛇，曾经告诉阿齐拉费尔（以及天堂）十一年的倒计时已经开始。而且和他的天使对应者一样，克劳利也是那个宣布这场末日大战应该被阻止的人。

“And did he actually go up to the First Choir to obtain approval, or just sign off on his own? And why wasn’t I informed my duties had changed?” Raphael asked.  
“他真的去找第一合唱团获得批准了吗，还是自己签字就行了？为什么我没有被告知我的职责发生了变化？”拉斐尔问道。

“It’s not my place to question authority,” Sandalphon demurred.  
“质疑权威不是我的职责，”桑达尔冯谦逊地说道。

Aziraphale had come up with the idea that the Great Plan and the Ineffable Plan were different in some essential way and that stopping Armageddon was part of the latter mostly as a prevarication--  
亚齐拉费尔提出了一个想法，即伟大计划和难以言喻的计划在某种本质上是不同的，而阻止末日的来临则主要是后者的一种搪塞手段

“The only authority that matters in Heaven is God’s,” Raphael’s voice was definitive, brooking no argument. “No one, not Gabriel, not Michael, and not me gets to give orders that run counter to the Almighty. Now, stand aside.”  
“在天堂中，唯一重要的权威是上帝的。”拉斐尔的声音坚定无比，不容置疑。“无论是加百列，还是米迦勒，甚至是我，都不能违背全能者的命令。现在，请让开。”

– but Crowley was equally insistent that it was the truth. Aziraphale had considered his insistence a means of coming to terms with Falling for questioning when Aziraphale had not Fallen for far more definitive defiance.  
\- 但克劳利同样坚称这是真相。阿齐拉费尔曾认为他的坚持是为了应对自己对堕落的质疑，因为相比于更为明确的反抗，阿齐拉费尔并没有堕落。

But between Azazel getting thrown down when Raphael hadn’t and this entire conversation-- Aziraphale now knew what humans meant by “the hair on the back of one’s neck standing up.”  
但是在拉斐尔还没有被扔下来的时候，以及整个对话中——亚撒谢尔现在知道人类所说的“后颈发麻”是什么意思了。

“No,” Sandalphon refused. “I was ordered to keep you from Earth. Unlike you, I follow orders.”  
“不行。”桑达尔芬拒绝道。“我被命令阻止你前往地球。与你不同，我遵循命令。”

“Those orders are wrong,” Raphael began. He was interrupted by Khizir stabbing Sandalphon through the chin, the point of her dagger sticking up out of the top of Sandalphon’s bald skull.  
“那些命令是错的。”拉斐尔开始说道。他被哈齐尔打断了，哈齐尔用匕首刺穿了桑达尔冯的下巴，匕首的尖端从桑达尔冯光头的顶部伸了出来。

Aziraphale let out a sound somewhere between a scream and a gag and covered his mouth. Khizir pulled the dagger out with a wet squelch. Sandalphon’s body dropped.  
亚齐拉费尔发出了一声介于尖叫和呕吐之间的声音，捂住了嘴巴。哈齐尔湿漉漉地拔出了匕首。桑达尔芬的尸体倒下了。

Best not to think about it. Really, very much, most definitely best not to think about it. Not now. Singularities. Temporal paradoxes. Universe flying apart or maybe imploding. Much, much more important things to deal with at the moment.  
最好不要想这个。真的，非常，绝对最好不要想这个。现在不是时候。奇点。时间悖论。宇宙飞散或者可能坍缩。此刻有更重要的事情要处理。

“Sandalphon will be fine once time resets and we don’t have time to argue with him.” Khizir wiped the silvery ichor off her blade on Sandalphon’s suit.  
“时间重置后，Sandalphon会没事的，我们没时间和他争论。” Khizir用布擦拭掉她的刀上的银色粘液，弄脏了Sandalphon的衣服。

Raphael made a series of nonsense sounds before settling on, “right.” It was the first time he really sounded like Crowley. Raphael grabbed Aziraphale’s upper arm and touched the part of the globe that corresponded to Megiddo.  
拉斐尔发出一连串的无意义的声音，最后停在了“对”的声音上。这是他第一次真正像克劳利那样的声音。拉斐尔抓住了亚齐拉费尔的上臂，触摸了与米吉多相对应的地球上的那一部分。

They appeared in the middle of an army base that looked eerily like Tadfield, save the arid terrain outside the fence. Adam, a giant red-eyed Irish wolfhound (the Hellhound, obviously), and Gabriel were standing in front of the four Horsemen. The seven of them were staring in mute surprise at their heavenly interlopers.  
他们出现在一个看起来酷似塔德菲尔德的军事基地中，只是外面的干旱地带与之不同。亚当，一只巨大的红眼爱尔兰猎犬（显然是地狱猎犬），和加百列站在四骑士面前。他们七个人惊讶地目瞪口呆地注视着这些天上的闯入者。

“I am out of here with that shit,” Aziraphale heard a male voice say. He turned around to see the chain link gate of the main entrance open. The human voice was one of the two guards, who hopped on his motorbike and rode out. The guard from the other tower had apparently decided his companion had the right of it, because he and his motorbike followed close behind.  
“我操，我走了。”阿齐拉费尔听到一个男声说道。他转过身去，看到主入口处的铁链门打开了。那个人的声音是两名警卫中的一个，他跳上摩托车驶了出去。另一个塔楼的警卫显然认为他的同伴是对的，因为他也骑着摩托车紧随其后。

Anathema swung onto her bicycle and rode in through the open gate.  
安娜塞玛骑着自行车穿过敞开的大门进入了。

“Thanks!” she yelled, waving as she rode by. “Good luck!”  
“谢谢！”她大声喊道，一边骑过一边挥手。“祝你好运！”

“You, too!” Aziraphale called back politely.  
“你也一样！”亚齐拉费尔礼貌地回答道。

“You better be here because you had a change of heart,” Gabriel said to Raphael.  
"你最好是因为你改变了心意才来这里的，" 加百列对拉斐尔说道。

Raphael summoned his staff, gold wrapped with a snake. He teleported forward, hooking his staff under Demonsbane’s throat and pulling his arms tight, pinning the back of the Hellhound’s head to his stomach. Then he shot skyward, wings unfurling, taking the Hellhound with him. The bubbling craters that would signal Azazel’s and Crowley’s arrival were nowhere to be seen.  
拉斐尔召唤了他的法杖，金色包裹着一条蛇。他瞬间传送到前方，将法杖钩在恶魔斩杀者的喉咙下，用力拉紧他的手臂，将地狱猎犬的后脑勺固定在他的肚子上。然后他展开翅膀，带着地狱猎犬一起冲向天空。标志着阿撒泽尔和克劳利到来的冒泡坑洞不见踪影。

“Actually,” Aziraphale said clearly as he stepped forward, because changing minds was his part of the plan, “we’re here to change yours. This-- The entire universe, angels and all, will be destroyed if you don’t stop what you are doing at once.”  
“实际上，”阿齐拉费尔清晰地说道，他迈出一步，因为改变思想是他计划中的一部分，“我们来这里是为了改变你的想法。如果你不立即停止你正在做的事情，整个宇宙，包括天使在内，都将被摧毁。”

Gabriel blinked. Like Khizir, he clearly thought Aziraphale was Azazel, but unlike Khizir, there was no joy at the impossible coming true.  
加布里埃尔眨了眨眼睛。就像哈齐尔一样，他显然认为阿兹拉菲尔是阿撒扎勒，但与哈齐尔不同的是，他对不可能成真并没有任何喜悦之情。

“I don’t know how the Hell Raphael pulled this off, and I don’t care,” he stated. “Adam.”  
“我不知道拉斐尔到底是怎么做到的，我也不在乎。”他说道。“亚当。”

Adam snapped his fingers.  
亚当咔嗒一声弹了下指。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Humans had many inventions that Raphael was fond of – alcohol, his 1926 Bentley, and cinema being the top three – but the one which had made his life easiest was the typewriter. He no longer had to painstakingly mix bone paint, draw an enochian mandala on his floor, carefully arrange and light candles, have conversation after conversation with the glowing light on his ceiling or the subordinate descending from the portal, and then scrape candle wax and paint off his floor each day. Instead, Raphael had been able to engrave the mandala once apiece on two Remington 2s, send one upstairs, and then simply alternate typing with whoever was manning the other typewriter. The upstairs typewriter never degraded – there was no entropy in Heaven – and a simple miracle cleaned each paper sheet after it was filled. Another kept the Earthside typewriter in good repair. There were still in-person appointments, of course, but they were spaced out enough that the angels in question could simply use the main entrance.  
人类有许多发明让拉斐尔非常喜欢——酒精、他的1926年宾利和电影是其中最受他喜爱的三个——但让他生活最轻松的发明是打字机。他不再需要费力地调配骨灰颜料，画出恶魔符文图案在地板上，小心地摆放和点燃蜡烛，与天花板上的光明或从传送门降临的下级进行一次又一次的对话，然后每天清理地板上的蜡烛和颜料。相反，拉斐尔只需要在两台瑞明顿2号打字机上刻印一次符文图案，将其中一台送到楼上，然后与另一台打字机的操作者轮流打字即可。楼上的打字机永远不会退化——天堂没有熵——每张纸在填满后都会通过一个简单的奇迹清洁干净。另一个奇迹保持地球上的打字机处于良好状态。当然，还是会有面对面的约会，但它们之间的间隔足够长，使得相关的天使可以直接使用主入口。

Over the centuries, Raphael had given Azazel no end of grief for not updating his wardrobe in a timely fashion. Azazel had paid Raphael back with interest over not updating the Remington 2 with more modern typewriters nor a computer. Carving the mandala by hand into metal was enough of a hassle that Raphael took the ribbing.  
几个世纪以来，拉斐尔一直因为阿撒泽尔没有及时更新他的衣橱而给他带来了无尽的烦恼。阿撒泽尔则通过不更新雷明顿2型打字机或者使用电脑来报复拉斐尔。手工雕刻曼陀罗图案到金属上已经够麻烦的了，所以拉斐尔忍受了这些嘲笑。

It also had other advantages: when Azazel banged into his office without knocking, Heaven had neither eyes nor ears on it.  
它还有其他的优点：当阿撒泽尔没有敲门就闯进他的办公室时，天堂既没有眼睛也没有耳朵盯着它。

“Azazel? What the Hell? Do you have any idea how danger--”  
“阿撒谢尔？这是什么鬼？你有没有想过有多危险--”

The end of his sentence was interrupted by Azazel grabbing him by the lapels and slamming him against the wall between the ficus and the schefflera. Azazel let go of his suit with one hand and buried it in Raphael’s hair. That wasn’t unusual per se, Raphael had finally given up on the entire concept of “short hair” because Azazel kept miracling it long--  
他的话还没说完，阿撒泽尔就抓住他的衣领，狠狠地将他撞到了位于榕树和鹅掌楸之间的墙壁上。阿撒泽尔一只手松开他的衣服，另一只手深入拉斐尔的头发中。这并不算是什么奇怪的事情，拉斐尔已经放弃了“短发”的概念，因为阿撒泽尔总是用神奇的力量让它变长——

Azazel pressed his mouth against Raphael’s.  
阿撒谢尔把嘴唇贴在拉斐尔的嘴上。

Oh. Kissing. _Oh._ 哦。亲吻。哦。

It was far more imperious than Raphael had expected, pressure interspersed with biting, but still good enough the angel’s eyes slid closed. He could feel it everywhere, a tingling contrast with the pressure of Azazel pinning him to the wall.  
它比拉斐尔预期的更加傲慢，压力交替着刺痛，但足够好，使天使的眼睛闭上了。他能感觉到它无处不在，与阿撒泽尔将他按在墙上的压力形成鲜明的对比。

Azazel let go. 阿撒谢尔放手。

“I,” Raphael panted, tilting his head up. Azazel made a frustrated noise and pressed his mouth to Raphael’s throat, continuing with the biting and adding sucking to the repertoire. Some part of Raphael was vaguely embarrassed by how quickly the demon was arousing him. His knees felt like he had a few more joints than there should be. “I thought-- kissing was against the rules.”  
“我，”拉斐尔喘着气，抬起头。阿撒泽尔发出一声沮丧的声音，将嘴唇贴在拉斐尔的喉咙上，继续咬嚼并加入吮吸的动作。拉斐尔的某个部分对恶魔如此迅速地勾起他的欲望感到有些尴尬。他的膝盖感觉好像比正常多了几个关节。“我以为——接吻是违规的。”

“Hang the rules,” Azazel growled into Raphael’s neck “You need to Fall.”  
“不要管规矩了，”阿撒泽尔咆哮着说道，他的声音在拉斐尔的脖子旁边回荡，“你需要堕落。”

His arousal response halted instantly. “Wait, what?” Reality warped and he tumbled backwards, naked, onto his own bed.  
他的兴奋反应立刻停止了。"等等，什么？" 现实扭曲，他赤裸着向后摔倒在自己的床上。

“Make an effort,” Azazel ordered, “and I’ll pick the opposite.”  
“努力一下，”阿撒泽尔命令道，“我会选择相反的。”

Raphael pushed himself back, most decidedly not making an effort, and pulled the duvet up to cover the smooth skin between his legs for good measure. Not that he thought sex with Azazel _would_ be anything the Almighty would object to, at least under non-coercive circumstances.  
拉斐尔向后退了一下，毫不费力地，然后拉起被子，为了保险起见，遮住了他双腿之间的光滑肌肤。他并不认为与阿撒泽尔发生性关系会引起全能者的反对，至少在非强迫的情况下。

“You need to Fall,” Azazel repeated, something desperate in his voice that had nothing to do with passion. “This is the fastest way to get there, but if you want to try striking Gabriel in the face first, I’m not averse--”  
“你需要堕落，”阿撒泽尔重复道，他的声音中带着一种绝望，与激情无关。“这是最快的到达方式，但如果你想先试着打击加百列的脸，我也不反对--”

“What are you talking about?” Raphael demanded so forcefully the windows rattled with the bass. Raphael cleared his throat. A snap of his fingers and he was back in his office-hours suit.  
“你在说什么？”拉斐尔强硬地要求，声音震得窗户都在颤动。拉斐尔清了清嗓子。他用手指一弹，瞬间又穿上了办公室的正装。

“We’ve only got eleven years till the end. If you’re an archangel when Armageddon starts, Hell won’t just kill you. They’ll make it take centuries. But,” Azazel’s voice turned beseeching, and he slid onto the bed, “I _did_ convert seven angels. I’m no Duke or Prince, but I’m not entirely without reputation. If you’re a demon, my demon, no one would dare to touch you. You’d be entirely safe. Well, from Hell at least. And they’d hardly expect anything supervisory from a raw recruit. You could do as you liked, when you liked, and the consequences would fall on you and you alone.”  
“我们只剩下十一年了。如果你在末日开始时是一个大天使，地狱不仅会杀了你，还会让你受尽折磨数个世纪。但是，”阿撒泽尔的声音变得恳求起来，他滑到床上说道，“我确实转化了七个天使。我虽然不是公爵或王子，但也并非毫无声望。如果你是我的恶魔，没有人敢触碰你。你将完全安全。至少，对地狱而言如此。而他们也不会对一个新兵有太多的监督要求。你可以随心所欲，无拘无束，后果将只由你自己承担。”

Raphael would be lying if he said there wasn’t part of him that wanted to close his eyes and let Azazel have his way.  
如果拉斐尔说他没有一部分想闭上眼睛让阿撒泽尔为所欲为的话，那他就是在撒谎。

Raphael rolled off the bed to stand, to move, to--  
拉斐尔从床上滚下来站起来，动起来，然后..

He knew he was slated for kicking off the battle of Armageddon, sounding the trumpet and all that. He had always imagined that would involve Metatron relaying the Word and then carrying out those instructions. It was possible that this was it instead: getting the information from Azazel and warning Heaven. Except--  
他知道自己注定要引发亚玛各顿之战，吹响号角之类的事情。他一直以为这将涉及梅塔特隆传达神谕并执行那些指示。但现在可能是这样的：从阿撒泽尔那里获取信息并警告天堂。除非——

For humans and their eighty-year lifespans, eleven years was a laughably short time to prepare something of that magnitude. For angels, with eternal lifespans, it was inconceivably short. Especially with Raphael doing double-duty here on Earth. More of his duties would have to be given to Khizir and she’d have to be trained to them; there would be at least one angel in midheaven sounding the warning and another angelic presence on Earth marking allied humans (a significant angelic presence if they had only eleven years to audit all of humanity); someone would have to resurrect the two prophets under the altar and there hadn’t even been deliberations on the selection. Preparing for Armageddon was a significant logistical output for more departments than just Uriel’s manufacturing and Michael’s strategy and drills.  
对于人类和他们八十年的寿命来说，十一年的时间根本不足以准备如此庞大的事情。对于拥有永恒寿命的天使来说，这简直是难以想象的短暂。尤其是拉斐尔在地球上承担双重任务。他的一些职责将不得不交给哈齐尔，并且她需要接受相应的培训；至少会有一个天使在天堂中发出警告，另一个天使会在地球上标记盟友人类（如果他们只有十一年的时间来审计整个人类，那么这将是一个重要的天使存在）；还需要有人将坛下的两位先知复活，但甚至还没有对选人进行讨论。为了准备末日战争，不仅乌列尔的制造部门和迈克尔的战略和演习部门需要做出重大的后勤投入。

Even if all the work was piled on Gabriel’s people, Raphael’s department would have to cover Gabriel’s duty roster to pick up the slack. It would require an adjustment to every billet in the department. He should have been informed by Metatron, or at least Michael.  
即使所有的工作都堆在加百列的人身上，拉斐尔的部门也必须承担起加百列的职责表，以弥补不足。这将需要对部门中的每个职位进行调整。他本应该由梅塔特隆或至少是迈克尔通知。

Unless-- 除非--

Unless what, Raphael had no idea.  
除非什么，拉斐尔毫无头绪。

“Are you certain it was the Antichrist you saw?” Raphael demanded, halting and turning to Azazel.  
“你确定你看到的是反基督吗？”拉斐尔停下来转向阿撒泽尔问道。

“What do you mean, am I certain? Of course I’m certain.” Azazel’s voice was disdainful. “I mean, he didn’t have ‘hoofiwoofkins’ or anything, but two Dukes of Hell and a Prince verified his identity.”  
“你说什么，我确定吗？当然我确定。”阿撒泽尔的声音充满了不屑。“我的意思是，他没有‘hoofiwoofkins’之类的东西，但是两位地狱公爵和一位王子都确认了他的身份。”

“How?” “怎么样？”

“In person and through the radio. Why does that--”  
亲自和通过广播。为什么那样--

“No, no.” Raphael waved his hand. “How is he the Son of Satan? To get a mortal human body through to Hell you’d need an angel. How did Hell pull it off on its own?”  
“不，不。”拉斐尔挥了挥手。“他怎么可能是撒旦之子？要让一个凡人的身体进入地狱，你需要一个天使。地狱自己怎么做到的？”

Azazel blinked. “Are you telling me this is the first you’ve heard of this?”  
阿撒谢尔眨了眨眼睛。“你是在告诉我这是你第一次听说这件事吗？”

“Yeah,” Raphael said, holding his hands out to the sides. “Would’ve told you, otherwise.” He hadn’t really gotten to the “what to do about Azazel at Armageddon” part of the plan yet. Finding out there was a hard deadline attached would certainly have moved it up on the priority list.  
“是的，”拉斐尔伸出双手，说道。“不然我早就告诉你了。”他还没有真正讨论“在末日之战中如何对付阿撒泽尔”的计划。如果知道有一个紧迫的截止日期，肯定会将此事提到优先考虑的名单上。

“But you’re an _archangel_,” Azazel protested.  
"但你是一个大天使，"亚撒谏道。

“Yeah!” Raphael repeated. “Which means--” He’d said to Khizir that if he had Azazel, it was possible Hell had a man in Heaven. He’d meant it as a lie, but apparently he’d been right. “Hell cannot start Armageddon unilaterally.”  
“是的！”拉斐尔重复道。“这意味着——”他曾告诉哈齐尔，如果他拥有阿撒泽尔，那么地狱可能在天堂中有一个人。他本来是说谎的，但显然他是对的。“地狱不能单方面发动末日审判。”

“Hell does not bow to the whims of the Almighty.” Azazel’s voice as positively haughty. He even squared his shoulders and lifted his jaw like a royal.  
地狱不会向全能者的心血来潮屈服。”阿撒泽尔的声音充满傲慢。他甚至挺直了肩膀，昂起下巴，像一位王室成员一样。

“It isn’t about that, hellfire.” Raphael’s hands moved, sketching his understanding into the air. “Listen, there are ten million each of angel and demon. Well, minus your seven, but a seven-man advantage isn’t going to change anything. If we’re going at it on our own, it’s going to be a stalemate. It’ll just go on bloody year after bloody year, with humans caught in the middle until there’s none of them left. We have to stop this!”  
“不是这个问题，见鬼。”拉斐尔的手动了起来，将他的理解勾勒在空中。“听着，天使和恶魔各有一千万。当然，减去你们七个，但七个人的优势不会改变什么。如果我们各自为战，只会陷入僵局。这场战斗将会持续血腥的年复一年，人类将被卷入其中，直到他们全部灭亡。我们必须停止这一切！”

“I _can’t_!” 我不行！

“You must!” "你必须！"

Azazel scrambled off the bed, his black eyes wild. “I can’t, and neither can you! Isn’t this the divine plan, six thousand years and it all goes up in smoke?”  
阿撒谢尔从床上匆忙下来，他的黑眼睛狂野地闪烁着。“我不能，你也不能！这不是神圣的计划吗？六千年的努力都化为乌有了？”

Raphael pressed forward, unrelenting. “Six thousand years from what, exactly? From the creation of the Earth? Adam? Eve? Does anyone know for sure? And while we’re on that topic, is it six thousand years our time or six thousand years the Almighty’s time? Thousand years is a day for God, so that’d put us, what? Two billion of our years, a million or so over. Almost at the end of the sun’s lifespan at that point. Sun will turn red, massive earthquakes, the oceans will boil, Moon’ll probably explode, meteors crashing down-- any of this sound familiar?”  
拉斐尔毫不留情地向前推进。“从什么时候开始的六千年呢？从地球的创造？亚当？夏娃？有人确切知道吗？而且顺便说一下，这六千年是我们的时间还是全能者的时间？上帝看一千年如同一天，那我们算起来是多少呢？大约二十亿年，再加上一百万年左右。差不多到了太阳寿命的尽头。太阳会变红，发生巨大地震，海洋会沸腾，月亮可能会爆炸，陨石会坠落——这些听起来熟悉吗？”

Azazel was still backing away. “You can’t possibly be suggesting Armageddon will be some sort of-- naturally occurring celestial phenomena.”  
阿撒泽尔仍在后退。“你不可能在暗示末日将是某种自然发生的天文现象。”

“I don’t know,” Raphael admitted. He held up his hand. “I only know two things about the end times. One, only the Almighty knows the day and the hour. Two, I’m the messenger for it. And as that messenger, I am telling you, someone has grabbed the Great Plan and made a wrong turn at Albuquerque.”  
“我不知道。”拉斐尔承认道。他举起手来。“关于末日，我只知道两件事。第一，只有全能者知道末日的日期和时间。第二，我是它的使者。作为这个使者，我告诉你，有人拿走了伟大的计划，并在阿尔布开基尔错了个弯。”

“I don’t know what that means,” Azazel said. Raphael grabbed the demon’s wrists to keep him from backing out the door.  
“我不知道那是什么意思。”阿撒泽尔说道。拉斐尔抓住恶魔的手腕，阻止他往后退。

“You know enough. If you won’t do it for humanity, then do it for yourself. There won’t be old bookshops, sushi, gravlax with dill sauce, small antique shops, _Daily Telegraph_ crosswords, interesting little restaurants where they know you. No Albert Hall, and,” Raphael paused, scraping the bottom of the barrel of Azazel’s interests, “no Regency silver snuffboxes. Not if my lot and yours get humanity killed by firing off early.”  
你知道得够多了。如果你不为了人类而做，那就为了你自己而做吧。将不再有旧书店、寿司、腌鲑鱼配莳萝酱、小型古董店、《每日电讯报》的填字游戏、那些熟悉你的有趣小餐馆。也不会有阿尔伯特音乐厅，还有...”拉斐尔停顿了一下，挖掘出了阿撒泽尔兴趣的底线，“没有摄政时期的银烟盒。如果我们这一群人和你们这一群人因为过早开火而让人类灭亡的话，这些都将不存在。”

Azazel made a wretched noise and pulled his wrists free of Raphael’s grip. Raphael’s apartment had similarities to Heaven – sleek lines, plenty of open spaces, easy to clean and kept clean – just as Azazel’s place was cluttered and barely-contained chaos. There was plenty of room for Azazel to fret.  
阿撒泽尔发出了一声可怜的噪音，挣脱了拉斐尔的控制。拉斐尔的公寓与天堂有相似之处——简洁的线条，宽敞的空间，易于清洁并保持整洁——而阿撒泽尔的地方则杂乱无章，几乎无法控制。阿撒泽尔有足够的空间来烦恼。

“Even if I did want to help you, and I don’t, what is there to do? The Antichrist is already _born_. It’s too late. He can warp reality at will. We can refuse all we like, it won’t matter. As soon as he says it’s time, it’s time.”  
即使我想帮你，但事实上我并不想，可是有什么可以做呢？反基督已经诞生了，为时已晚。他可以随心所欲地扭曲现实。我们可以拒绝，但那毫无意义。只要他说是时候，那就是时候了。

Raphael didn’t need to breathe but he held his breath anyway. He needed to think, he needed a plan--  
拉斐尔不需要呼吸，但他还是屏住了呼吸。他需要思考，他需要一个计划--

“What if he doesn’t?” he blurted.  
“如果他不愿意呢？”他脱口而出。

“He’s the Son of Satan, have you completely-- I don’t know why I’m talking to you.” Azazel turned to leave again, and Raphael caught him.  
他是撒旦之子，你完全--我不知道为什么我在和你说话。阿撒泽尔再次转身要离开，但拉斐尔拦住了他。

“It’s not genetic,” Raphael babbled as much as argued. “It can’t be. Angels and demons were created the same. If it was all genes, or what passes for genes with us, we’d all have Fallen or all stayed holy. We have a _kind_ of free will. Not as much as humans, but we have the right to choose. And this Antichrist is half-human, so he’s going to have even more choice than we do. If he’s a kid he’s still moldable. We just have to make sure we mold him the right way – to call this off.”  
“这不是遗传的。”拉斐尔边说边争辩道。“不可能是遗传的。天使和恶魔是同样被创造的。如果一切都是基因，或者对我们来说是基因的东西，我们要么都堕落，要么都保持圣洁。我们有一种自由意志。虽然不如人类那么多，但我们有选择的权利。而这个反基督是半人半魔，所以他的选择余地会更大。如果他还是个孩子，他还是可以被塑造的。我们只需要确保我们以正确的方式来塑造他，来取消这一切。”

“You’re entirely certain this would work?” Azazel asked.  
“你完全确定这会起作用吗？”阿撒泽尔问道。

“On my professional responsibility as the archangel in charge of young people, yes,” Raphael confirmed solemnly. He released Azazel’s arm. “This entire thing is in my wheelhouse and you know it, hellfire.”  
作为负责年轻人的大天使，我在我的职责范围内确认，是的，”拉斐尔庄重地确认道。他松开了阿撒泽尔的手臂。“整件事情都在我的掌控范围内，你知道的，地狱之火。”

Azazel made another wretched noise, but this one was laced with frustration. “You are-- entirely too stubborn when you believe you are right.”  
阿撒谢尔发出了另一个可怜的声音，但这次带着沮丧。“你太固执了，当你认为自己是对的时候。”

“I am right and you know it. If you were in my rubbish any deeper, you’d be nailing ninety-five reasons Heaven is wrong to their door. You can’t back out now.”  
我是对的，你也知道。如果你再深陷于我的垃圾中，你会给天堂的门上钉上九十五个理由，证明他们是错的。现在你不能退缩了。

Azazel was very many things, but stupid wasn’t one of them.  
阿撒谢尔是许多事情，但愚蠢不是其中之一。

“He was _yours_?! Hastur gave me a _medal_, not a commendation, a _medal_ and I had to, to, to prevaricate my way through an acceptance speech when I didn’t even know who Luther was!”  
他是你的？！哈斯特给了我一枚勋章，不是表彰，是一枚勋章，我不得不在接受演讲中支支吾吾，因为我甚至不知道路德是谁！

Raphael felt a smile curl his mouth against his will. “I didn’t think Hell gave out medals for trying to bring humans ‘round to a less materialistic form of worship.”  
拉斐尔感到一丝微笑不由自主地浮现在他的嘴角上。“我没想到地狱会颁发奖章给那些试图让人类转向一种更少物质主义的崇拜方式的人。”

“You sowed dissent in the Church,” Azazel’s voice was still wretched, but the frustration had upgraded to a sort of fond exasperation. Forgiveness was on the horizon.  
“你在教会中播下了不和谐的种子。”阿撒泽尔的声音依然痛苦，但挫折感升级为一种深情的厌烦。宽恕已经在望。

“Church needed a little dissent. Now are you in or not?”  
教会需要一点异议。你现在加入还是不加入？

Azazel sighed, his round shoulders slumping in defeat. “Fine. I suppose you’ll be telling Heaven you’re thwarting my evil attempts to bring the Antichrist round to Hell’s way of thinking?”  
阿撒谢尔叹了口气，他圆滚滚的肩膀无力地耷拉下来。“好吧，我猜你会告诉天堂，说你正在阻止我将邪恶的企图带领反基督者走向地狱的思维方式？”

Raphael pulled back his sleeve. There were two pale scars on each arm, one circling his wrist and the other farther down his forearm. He only revealed the top scar, but Azazel knew the lower scar was there.  
拉斐尔拉起袖子。他的每只手臂上都有两道苍白的疤痕，一道环绕着他的手腕，另一道则更靠下，位于前臂上。他只露出了上面的疤痕，但阿撒泽尔知道下面的疤痕也在那里。

In 1933, before the opening of Dachau, Gabriel and Michael had chained Raphael to his old office in Heaven “for his own good.” They’d said they were worried he’d actively resist the Nazis and end up Fallen as a result. They had sent lesser angels down to Earth in Raphael’s place with instructions not to say a word to Azazel. Azazel had concluded Heaven had killed or incarcerated his archangel. To teach them the depth of their mistake, Azazel had went right back to manipulating his adversaries into Falling. Losing four angels in twelve years had certainly lent weight to Khizir’s protest that only Raf was immune to Azazel’s mental terrorism.  
1933年，在达豪集中营开放之前，加百列和迈克尔将拉斐尔锁在了他在天堂的旧办公室里，他们说这是为了他自己好。他们担心他会积极抵抗纳粹，并最终堕落。他们派遣了较低级的天使代替拉斐尔来到地球，并告诉他们不要对阿撒泽尔说一句话。阿撒泽尔得出结论，天堂已经杀死或监禁了他的大天使。为了教训他们犯下的错误，阿撒泽尔立即开始操纵他的对手堕落。在十二年内失去了四个天使，这无疑证明了哈齐尔的抗议，只有拉斐尔对阿撒泽尔的心理恐怖免疫。

Raphael couldn’t end up chained to his office again. This was too important.  
拉斐尔不能再次被困在办公室里。这太重要了。

“I’m not telling Heaven a thing,” Raphael said. Normally he would seal this with a handshake, but Azazel had unintentionally discovered a more pleasant method was safe. Raphael stepped forward to grasp both his demon’s hands. He tilted his head and pressed his mouth to Azazel’s. This kiss was soft, sweet, like he’d imagined it would be. It warmed him all the way to his extremities.  
“我什么都不告诉天堂。”拉斐尔说道。通常情况下，他会用握手来确认这一点，但是阿撒泽尔无意中发现了一种更愉快的方式是安全的。拉斐尔向前迈出一步，握住了他的恶魔的双手。他微微倾斜头，将嘴唇贴在阿撒泽尔的嘴上。这个吻是柔软而甜蜜的，就像他想象中的那样。它温暖了他的全身，直到四肢百骸。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Adam didn’t have dreams. Well, he did, of course, but not the kind in movies or that kids talked about in school. He didn’t dream of going naked to school or spiders or circuses or flying.  
亚当没有梦想。嗯，当然，他有梦想，但不是电影里的那种，也不是孩子们在学校里谈论的那种。他不梦见上学赤身裸体，也不梦见蜘蛛、马戏团或飞行。

He dreamed of the Archangel Gabriel, for as long as he could remember. Sometimes he dreamed from Gabriel’s perspective, like memories: the Rebellion in Heaven, the wickedness of Sodom, of the Nephilim – beings with an angel’s power and a human’s savagery, who had ruled Man like demi-gods until the Flood washed them all away. Other times he dreamed of the future: of fighting by Gabriel’s side, of destroying the demons, of proving that Order and Discipline were to be preferred over unchecked independence, of the death of mankind that would result. Other times, he dreamed in the present: lessons in Enochian and angelic magic, in harnessing his powers, of the importance of his task and the insignificance of Man.  
他一直梦见大天使加百列，就像他能记得的那样。有时他从加百列的视角梦见，就像回忆一样：天堂的叛乱，索多玛的邪恶，巨人后裔——拥有天使力量和人类野蛮性的存在，曾像半神一样统治着人类，直到洪水将他们全部冲走。其他时候，他梦见未来：与加百列并肩作战，摧毁恶魔，证明秩序和纪律胜过无限自由，以及由此带来的人类灭亡。还有时候，他在梦中经历现在：学习以诺语和天使魔法，驾驭自己的力量，了解自己任务的重要性以及人类的微不足道。

His parents didn’t understand, of course. Like the British against Joan of Arc, they had persecuted him – diagnoses of madness instead of accusations of witchcraft, pills and therapists instead of tortures and inquisitors. Just as Gabriel (the real Gabriel, not the piano teacher he pretended to be around Adam’s parents) had said. And like Joan of Arc, Adam had emerged from that persecution whole of purpose and faith. The Son of Satan had become a saint, and this dog before him was proof.  
他的父母当然不理解。就像英国人对待贞德一样，他们迫害了他——诊断为疯狂而不是指控为巫术，用药物和治疗师代替折磨和审判官。就像加布里埃尔（真正的加布里埃尔，而不是他在亚当父母面前假装的钢琴老师）所说的那样。而且像贞德一样，亚当从那场迫害中走出来，心怀目标和信仰。撒旦之子已经成为了圣人，而眼前的这只狗就是证明。

Gabriel had prophesied that Hell would send him a guardian, a monstrous dog to protect him and birth his powers into fullness. And here the Hellhound was, glowing red eyes and savage teeth. Waiting to be named.  
加百列曾预言地狱会派遣一只守护者给他，一只怪兽般的狗，来保护他并使他的力量充分展现。而现在地狱猎犬就在这里，红色的眼睛和凶猛的牙齿。等待着被命名。

“Demonsbane,” Adam said. The dog shifted, changing into a great wolfhound, though the wolves this hound would hunt weren’t mere animals.  
“恶魔之灭”，亚当说道。狗转身变成了一只巨大的猎狼犬，尽管这只猎犬要追捕的狼并非普通的动物。

As the Hellhound shifted, so did he, the underpinnings of reality wakening in his consciousness. Joan had picked Charles out of a crowd. He could make Charles live again.  
当地狱犬移动时，他也在移动，现实的基础在他的意识中苏醒。琼从人群中挑选出了查尔斯。他可以让查尔斯再次活过来。

Guided by the Archangel Gabriel, not Saint Michael, and with the armies of Heaven instead of the French, he would bring about a restoration for all, not just France.  
在大天使加百列的引领下，而不是圣米迦勒，以天堂的军队而不是法国人，他将带来全面的恢复，不仅仅是法国。

Demonsbane howled. 恶魔咆哮着。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

The Antichrist snapped his fingers on Gabriel’s orders and Aziraphale _died_. No blood, no trauma, just glassy eyes and his corporation dropping to the ground like Sandalphon’s had.  
反基督在加百列的命令下，轻轻一弹手指，亚齐拉费尔就死了。没有血，没有创伤，只有呆滞的眼神，他的身体像桑达尔芬一样倒在地上。

Khizir took a deep breath. It looked like she was up. The Horsemen were watching the scene mutely, waiting for the Antichrist’s command, and the Antichrist was waiting for Gabriel’s.  
哈齐尔深吸了一口气。看起来她醒了。骑士们默默地观察着场景，等待着反基督的命令，而反基督则在等待加百列的指示。

“Gabriel, sir,” Khizir said, stepping forward as unthreateningly as she could. Her voice only trembled a bit on the I. “I understand that you want things settled with Hell, I do. We all do. Whether God is fit to rule Heaven is a very important question, but playing with time isn’t the way to prove your point. If the paradox isn’t closed, it’ll force time into a loop that will destroy everything the Almighty has ever created. You have to help us stop this.”  
“Gabriel, 先生，” Khizir 尽量以不威胁的方式向前迈步，她的声音只在“I”上微微颤抖。“我明白您想要与地狱解决问题，我明白。我们都明白。上帝是否适合统治天堂是一个非常重要的问题，但玩弄时间并不是证明您观点的方式。如果这个悖论没有被解决，它将迫使时间陷入一个循环，摧毁上帝曾经创造的一切。您必须帮助我们阻止这一切。”

“Go back to Heaven, Khizir, this doesn’t concern you,” Gabriel said.  
“回到天堂去吧，哈齐尔，这与你无关。”加百列说道。

“As one of the people living in creation, yes, sir, it does,” Khizir argued. She stepped forward another precious step. She had no idea what she’d do when she got to Gabriel and his half-human child-weapon. “Starting Armageddon early, manipulating the Antichrist into siding with Heaven, changing time – we’re _Heaven_. We’re not supposed to cheat, and if we win by acting like Hell: are we any different? What does it matter if we win the war if we lose everything that we are in the process?”  
作为生活在创世之中的人之一，是的，先生，确实如此，”Khizir争辩道。她又迈出了一步宝贵的步伐。当她走到加百列和他那个半人类的孩子武器面前时，她不知道自己该怎么办。“提前引发末日，操纵反基督使其站在天堂一边，改变时间——这就是我们天堂的所作所为。我们不应该作弊，如果我们通过像地狱一样行事来取胜：我们还有什么不同？如果我们在战争中取胜却失去了我们的一切，那又有什么意义呢？”

“That’s a neat trick,” Gabriel said grimly. “It’s your mouth moving, but Raphael’s voice is coming out.”  
“这真是个巧妙的把戏，”加百列阴沉地说道。“你的嘴巴在动，但是拉斐尔的声音却传出来了。”

“Because she’s right,” Raphael said, dropping down onto the tarmac. The Hellhound was nowhere to be seen. There wasn’t even blood on his suit. “I’ll never consent to helping you meddle with time. If even one of the other archangels dies in the fighting, you won’t be able to send the note back to tell yourself to change things. Time will rewrite itself over and over again until everyone and everything dies. We may have had this exact conversation already. We wouldn’t remember--”  
“因为她是对的。”拉斐尔说着，落在了停机坪上。地狱犬已经不见了踪影，他的衣服上甚至没有一滴血迹。“我绝不会同意你干涉时间的计划。如果其他大天使中有一个在战斗中死去，你就无法将便条送回过去，告诉自己改变事情。时间会一次又一次地重写自己，直到每个人和每件事都死去。也许我们已经进行过这个对话了，只是我们不会记得——”

“Aziraphale!” It was Raphael’s voice, but coarsened and desperate.  
“阿齐拉费尔！”这是拉斐尔的声音，但变得粗糙而绝望。

“GIVE THE COMMAND,” Death intoned, “AND I WILL END THEIR INTERFERENCE FOR GOOD.”  
"下达命令吧，"死神低沉地说道，"我会彻底终结他们的干扰。"

The other Raphael was dressed like a failed rockstar in leather with Victorian glasses and a ridiculous haircut. The ground beneath him was fading back from red to black – the demon version of himself Raf had told her about. Azazel stood next to him, drawing his sword, a sword he shouldn’t have, the holy blade corrupted into night-black steel edged in frost. If the demon-Raphael saw any of them, he gave no indication. He made straight for what was left of Aziraphale, checking the corpse for life and pleading brokenly for the answer to be different. Gabriel’s expression was one of horror.  
另一个拉斐尔穿着失败的摇滚明星风格的皮衣，戴着维多利亚式眼镜和荒谬的发型。他脚下的地面从红色渐渐变成黑色 - 这是拉斐尔告诉她的恶魔版本。阿撒泽尔站在他旁边，拔出剑来，一把他本不该有的剑，圣剑被腐化成夜黑色的钢刃，边缘冰冷。如果恶魔拉斐尔看到他们中的任何一个，他没有给出任何迹象。他径直走向剩下的阿齐拉费尔，检查尸体是否还有生命，并哀求着答案能有所不同。加百列的表情充满了恐惧。

The Antichrist nodded. 反基督点了点头。

Time was again reset, and Gabriel again sent back his note, bringing the total number of re-writes to four.  
时间再次被重置，加百列再次发送了他的便条，这使得重新写的次数总共达到了四次。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Plan A had tanked on every possible level. Three o’clock had come and passed with no Hellhound. Azazel had confirmed with Hell that the dog had been released, so it wasn’t that the fault was in the delivery. They simply had the wrong boy. Even Azazel’s “entertainment” had been rubbish, though granted, that part of Plan A failing was a surprise only to Azazel. “Fun.” Rubbish. Azazel would have been better off with proper magic.  
计划A在各个层面上都失败了。三点钟过去了，没有地狱猎犬出现。阿撒泽尔已经确认地狱犬已经释放了，所以问题不在于交付上出了差错。他们只是找错了人。即使是阿撒泽尔的“娱乐”也是垃圾，尽管可以承认，计划A失败的这一部分只有阿撒泽尔感到意外。“有趣。”垃圾。阿撒泽尔最好还是用适当的魔法。

Warlock had to be a decoy. Azazel was incandescent with fury over the insult that Hell would dare to use him as a patsy, like some common imp with no service record. Raphael was more concerned with why Hell thought Azazel was the one to use to throw Heaven off the track. If they suspected--  
术士必须充当诱饵。阿撒泽尔对地狱竟然敢将他当作替罪羊感到愤怒不已，就像一个没有任何服务记录的普通小鬼一样。拉斐尔更关心的是为什么地狱认为阿撒泽尔是用来迷惑天堂的最佳人选。如果他们怀疑的话--

If they suspected, Azazel was in danger because of Raphael.  
如果他们怀疑，阿撒泽尔因为拉斐尔而处于危险之中。

Not that it would matter for long with the Antichrist out of pocket. They had been mentoring the wrong child for eleven years, and who knew what the actual boy would choose.  
现在反基督已经失踪，这些都已经不重要了。他们错误地指导了一个孩子十一年，而谁知道真正的男孩会做出什么选择。

If the Antichrist wouldn’t be calling this mistaken Armageddon to a halt, then Heaven had to.  
如果反基督不停止这场错误的末日战争，那么天堂就必须出手了。

Plan B didn’t have any better prospects than Plan A, and God knew Raphael had no ideas how Plan C (find the actual Antichrist and convince _him_ to call off Armageddon) was ever going to get off the ground.  
B计划并没有比A计划更好的前景，而且天知道拉斐尔根本不知道C计划（找到真正的反基督并说服他取消末日审判）如何能够成功展开。

Outside the main complex, Heaven was bustling. Uriel’s people had been churning out weapons as fast as they could make them for the past eleven years, starting just after Raphael had found out. Back channel communication had been confirmed, which had made secrecy all the more imperative. Michael’s people were leading those from the three other departments in last-minute drills. Raphael’s people were healers and observers. Active combat wasn’t their role beyond basic self-defense. Almost his entire section had been converted to hospital facilities, and the surveillance coverage of Earth had been doubled. Khizir hated it, so vehemently so that he’d had to tell her the truth about his mentoring of Warlock to keep her from personally evicting Uriel’s renovation crews.  
在主要的建筑外，天堂一片繁忙。乌列尔的人民在过去的十一年里一直在全力制造武器，从拉斐尔发现之后就开始了。秘密的背渠道通信已经得到确认，这使得保密变得更加重要。迈克尔的人民正在带领其他三个部门的人进行最后一刻的演练。拉斐尔的人民是治疗师和观察员，除了基本的自卫之外，他们并不参与实际战斗。他的整个部门几乎都被改建成了医院设施，并且对地球的监控覆盖范围已经扩大了一倍。卡齐尔非常讨厌这一切，以至于他不得不告诉她关于他指导战术师的真相，以免她亲自驱逐乌列尔的装修队伍。

Raphael found Gabriel in his office. His desk was piled high with Michael’s maps and plans. He looked like Azazel after eating chilled prinsesstarta.  
拉斐尔在办公室里找到了加百列。他的办公桌上堆满了迈克尔的地图和计划。他看起来像是吃了冷冻公主蛋糕的阿撒泽尔。

“Raphael,” Gabriel said brightly, with a thousand-dollar smile. He stood with his arms out, doubtless more out of respect for Raphael’s place in the hierarchy than Raphael himself. “You’re back, good. I hope you’ve been practicing your Reveille.”  
“拉斐尔，”加百利兴高采烈地说道，脸上洋溢着灿烂的笑容。他伸出双臂，毫无疑问更多是出于对拉斐尔在等级体系中地位的尊重，而非对拉斐尔本人。“你回来了，太好了。希望你一直在练习你的晨钟。”

“No,” Raphael said. Gabriel’s smile dulled.  
“不，”拉斐尔说道。加百列的微笑黯淡了下来。

“Well, I’m sure it’s like swinging a sword. You never really forget.”  
嗯，我相信这就像挥舞一把剑一样。你永远不会真正忘记。

“Never was one for blades, you know that.” Raphael was the only archangel without a bladed weapon – a quarterstaff, wrapped in a serpent. More defensive than offensive, very nearly ornamental. Raphael slid the office door closed behind him. If Gabriel was trying to save face, he’d be utterly intractable.  
“从来不喜欢刀剑，你知道的。”拉斐尔是唯一一个没有刀剑武器的大天使——他使用的是一根缠着蛇的长棍。这把武器更多的是用于防御，几乎可以说是装饰性的。拉斐尔关上办公室的门。如果加百列想要保全面子，他会变得非常固执。

“Could you not?” Gabriel’s shallow friendliness disappeared. “Whatever it is you’re about to do, or say, or-- One thing. One thing without you being difficult, is that too much to ask?”  
“你能不能不这样？”加布里埃尔浅薄的友好消失了。“无论你要做什么，或者说什么，或者——只有一件事。只有一件事，你能不那么难以相处吗？这样太过分了吗？”

“Yeah,” Raphael agreed. “You need to call this off.”  
“是的，”拉斐尔同意道。“你需要取消这个计划。”

“For the love of--” “为了爱的--”

“What? God?” Raphael demanded. He talked over Gabriel’s irritated affirmative. “Because I don’t see a whole lot of divine participation in this. Just you and the others.” _And Hell_, Raphael did not say, because until he knew who to silence he didn’t dare tell anyone other than Khizir that Azazel had informed.  
“什么？上帝？”拉斐尔要求。他打断了加百列烦躁的肯定回答。“因为我在这里看不到多少神圣的参与。只有你和其他人。”至于地狱，拉斐尔没有说，因为在他知道该如何保持沉默之前，他不敢告诉除了哈齐尔以外的任何人，阿撒泽尔已经通知了他。

“Metatron has approved things every step of the way,” Gabriel said.  
“加百列说，梅塔特隆在每一步都批准了事情。”

“And did he actually inquire up top before signing off? If he did, where are his pets?”  
他在签字之前真的打听过吗？如果他打听过，他的宠物在哪里？

“I don’t have time for this. Just show up to the party, shut your stupid mouth, and blow your trumpet. It’s all you have to do.” Gabriel sat back down in his chair and pulled a map from the pile.  
“我没时间搞这些。就去参加派对，闭上你那愚蠢的嘴巴，吹吹你的喇叭。这就是你要做的。”加布里埃尔重新坐回椅子上，从一堆东西中拿出一张地图。

“Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jonah, Elijah, Elisha, Zedekiah, Zephaniah, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah,” Raphael named them off as he approached Gabriel’s desk, “Jesus, Peter, Paul. Every time, every single judgment event, Metatron had some human pet running around telling anyone who would listen and everyone who wouldn’t. Every single time. For this one there are supposed to be a _minimum_ of two, raised from the dead in some way and backed by an angel in midheaven. Where are they and their angel? Where’s the angel – or angels, since you haven’t even started yet – marking the allied humans for salvation?”  
挪亚、亚伯拉罕、摩西、约拿、以利亚、以利沙、西底家、西番雅、以赛亚、以西结、耶利米，拉斐尔一边走向加百列的办公桌，一边念着名字，“耶稣、彼得、保罗。每一次，每一次审判事件，梅塔特隆总有一些人类宠物四处奔走，告诉任何愿意听的人和不愿意听的人。每一次都是如此。根据规定，这一次至少应该有两个人，以某种方式从死者中复活，并得到天使在天空中的支持。他们和他们的天使在哪里？那个天使——或者说天使们，因为你们甚至还没有开始——在哪里为联合的人类标记救赎？”

“The Almighty has not seen fit to declare a significant angelic presence on Earth,” Gabriel said tightly.  
"全能者并未认为在地球上宣告有重要的天使存在是必要的，" 加百列紧绷地说道。

“Why not?” 为什么不呢？

“It’s not my place or yours to question the Almighty,” Gabriel said tightly.  
“质疑全能者不是我们的职责，无论是我还是你。”加百列紧绷地说道。

“Seemed to work for the Bereans. Noble-minded, I think was the term used.”  
似乎对比利亚人起了作用。我想他们被称为高尚的心灵。

Gabriel’s smile was utterly without warmth and he didn’t look up from his page.  
加布里埃尔的微笑完全没有温暖，他也没有抬头看他的书页。

“Don’t you dare quote some mortal human mouthpiece to me. I’m the Archangel fucking Gabriel.”  
“你敢引用一些凡人的嘴脸对我说教吗？我可是大天使加百列。”

Raphael placed both hands on Gabriel’s desk and leaned over it. “‘Let God be found true, though every angel be found a liar.’ Well, he didn’t say angel, but: it’s in the spirit of the thing.” It was the same prophet Raphael had paraphrased before, and Gabriel knew it.  
拉斐尔双手放在加百列的桌子上，俯身靠近。“‘上帝必然真实，即使每个天使都是个说谎者。’嗯，他没有说天使，但是：这是精神上的意思。”这是拉斐尔之前改述过的同一位先知，加百列心知肚明。

The other archangel looked up. His eyes were bright purple, his jaw set, mouth in a thin line.  
另一位大天使抬起头来。他的眼睛闪亮的紫色，下颚紧绷，嘴唇紧闭。

“Get out of my office.”  
滚出我的办公室。

“Not until you call this off. This isn’t the right time.”  
直到你取消这个计划之前，现在不是合适的时候。

“The Anti-christ has been born, and the horsemen are being summoned. It’s time.”  
“反基督已经诞生，四骑士正在被召唤。是时候了。”

“Oh yes, the parts Heaven and Hell are responsible for are ticking along nicely. It’s the parts God’s supposed to be doing but isn’t that are worrying me. Because this? Looks a lot like you care more about going forward with _your_ interpretation of how God’s will should be done and proving yourself right than about what God’s will actually _is_.”  
哦，是的，天堂和地狱的那些部分都在顺利运转。让我担心的是，上帝应该负责的那些部分，他却没有去做。因为这看起来更像是你更关心按照你对上帝旨意的解释去前进，证明自己是对的，而不是真正关心上帝的旨意是什么。

Gabriel moved faster than Raphael had ever seen, papers flying everywhere. The side of Raphael’s face went numb and then hot, his ears ringing. His back hit the wall hard enough he heard the glass window splinter. Gabriel had him by the lapels.  
加布里埃尔的动作比拉斐尔以往见过的任何人都快，纸张四处飞扬。拉斐尔的脸颊一阵麻木，然后变得火辣，耳朵嗡嗡作响。他的背部猛烈撞击到墙上，足够强烈以至于他听到了玻璃窗的碎裂声。加布里埃尔紧紧抓住他的衣领。

“Pride,” Raphael lengthened the vowels for emphasis even though pain was radiating outward in spikes from his spine and his face ached. He could taste ichor in his mouth. “Wrath. You keep this up, you’re going to Fall.”  
“骄傲，”拉斐尔强调地拉长了元音，尽管他的脊椎传来刺痛，脸上也隐隐作痛。他口中尝到了血浆的味道。“愤怒。你要是继续这样下去，你会堕落的。”

“The only one in this room who should be Fallen is you,” Gabriel said coldly.  
“这个房间里唯一应该堕落的人就是你。”加百列冷冷地说道。

“Go ahead.” Raphael smiled even though it made the pain in his lip worse. He felt oddly giddy, almost weightless – the arrow loosed from the bow. He had never felt more certain about anything in his long, long life. “See if it takes.”  
“继续吧。”拉斐尔微笑着，尽管这让他嘴唇上的疼痛更加剧烈。他感到奇怪的兴奋，几乎是无重感 - 箭从弓上射出。在他漫长的生命中，他从未对任何事情如此确定过。“看看它是否成功。”

Gabriel’s door opened. Raphael was shoved so hard he was nearly thrown. He took the fall as a roll, hard stone tile under his palms and knees. His hair had come loose and hung around his face.  
加百列的门打开了。拉斐尔被猛力推开，几乎被摔倒。他以一个滚动的方式接受了这一摔倒，手掌和膝盖着地的坚硬石砖。他的头发散乱地垂在脸上。

Gabriel’s door slammed shut. So much for Plan B.  
加布里埃尔的门砰地一声关上了。计划B也泡汤了。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

“Cigarettes. Now.”  香烟。现在。

There were many, many ways that Crowley had been greeted by Ligur over the centuries, but this one was new.  
多年来，Ligur以各种方式迎接克劳利，但这次是全新的。

Hastur was making a noise somewhere between a screech and utter disbelief.  
哈斯特尔发出了一声介于尖叫和完全不信的噪音。

“No, he did it, the son of a bitch actually did it, now _pay up_,” Ligur continued. He held his hand out and made a grabby gesture. Azazel wore the same expression Aziraphale wore when he’d maneuvered Crowley into something the demon wasn’t completely sold on.  
“不，他做到了，这个混蛋居然做到了，现在付钱吧。”利古尔继续说道。他伸出手来，并做了一个抓取的手势。阿撒泽尔的表情和阿齐拉费尔在将克劳利卷入一些他并不完全认同的事情时的表情一样。

“Never bet against me, my dear, never,” Azazel said to Hastur, taking Crowley by the arm and leading him by the dukes. “Now if you’ll excuse me, he’s fresh out of grace. Little top-up with Hellfire and he’ll be right as rain, you understand….”  
“亲爱的，永远不要对我下赌注，永远不要。”阿撒泽尔对哈斯图尔说着，一边拉着克劳利的胳膊，一边带着他走开。“现在请原谅我，他已经没有了恩典。用地狱之火稍作补充，他就会恢复如初，你明白吗……”

Hastur was too busy being impressed that Azazel had landed a crippling blow on Heaven five minutes before the battle had even started to respond. Ligur was too busy seizing the chance to be in charge of the cigarette box himself, instead of having them doled out one-by-one.  
Hastur对于Azazel在战斗开始前五分钟就对天堂造成了致命打击感到非常惊讶，以至于无法回应。Ligur则趁机抓住机会自己掌管香烟盒，而不是一个一个地分发。

Crowley hadn’t been in Hell before the last Armageddon. It was complete chaos, people shoving by and shouting at each other, the air filled with the clang of weapons and various attempts at psyching themselves up. Raphael hadn’t been wrong about angelic stock being built for a purpose, and the unused but still very present administrative part of Crowley’s brain bristled at how uncoordinated it all was. Hell had been so focused on becoming stronger and more vicious that they’d spent no time on becoming better _organized_. But then, these were the same lot who hadn’t sealed the hospital before the most important birth in millennia.  
克劳利在最后的末日之前从未去过地狱。那里一片混乱，人们争相推挤、互相喊叫，空气中充满了武器的撞击声和各种试图激励自己的声音。拉斐尔对天使的库存建设并没有错，克劳利脑海中未使用但仍然存在的行政部分对于这一切的不协调感到不满。地狱一直专注于变得更强大和更凶残，却没有花时间提高组织能力。但这些人连在千年来最重要的诞生之前都没有封住医院，也是同一批人。

They stopped at the first gout of Hellfire they saw between the main entrance and the secondary door. Crowley stepped inside. Hellfire was the only good part about Hell, blissful heat that soaked into every ounce of muscle. Crowley tilted his head back, letting the fresh heat bank the pitiful flame in his gut and letting it burn through his veins. He spread his hands, letting it pour into him, warm, warm, warm--  
他们停在主入口和次要门之间看到的第一道地狱之火前。克劳利走了进去。地狱之火是地狱中唯一美好的部分，它的炽热让每一寸肌肉都感到幸福。克劳利仰起头，让新鲜的热量铺满他肚子里可怜的火焰，并让它燃烧穿过他的血脉。他伸开双手，让热量涌入他的身体，温暖，温暖，温暖--

The flame was gone, expended. Azazel was staring at him with his mouth slightly open.  
火焰熄灭了，消耗殆尽。阿撒泽尔睁大眼睛盯着他。

“What?” Crowley demanded.  
“什么？”克劳利要求道。

“That was an _entire font of Hellfire_.”  
那是一整个地狱之火的源泉。

Crowley stepped out. “Are you really going to have a go at me for gluttony? Seriously?”  
克劳利走了出来。“你真的要因为暴食而对我发飙吗？真的吗？”

“That’s not--” Azazel sighed with impatience as they started walking toward one of the secondary exits. “With that kind of spell capacity you could accomplish enough to be made a Duke. Prince, if you played your cards right and something happened to occur to one of the others.”  
“那不是——”阿撒泽尔不耐烦地叹了口气，他们开始朝其中一个次要出口走去。“凭借那种法术能力，你足以做出足够的成就，被封为公爵。如果你打好牌，而其他人发生了什么事情，你甚至可以成为王子。”

“I don’t want to play my cards right,” Crowley snapped. Aziraphale as a true believer made a sort of sense – the angel desperately wanted to be Right and Good, and getting chucked out of Heaven for no cause would certainly put a hiccup in that. It was also bloody annoying now that they were working for the same company, as it were. “I don’t want to run Hell, I didn’t even want to be part of--” Crowley bit off his words in a sibilant hiss. Hell wasn’t the place for this conversation. Up until seven months ago, his own side hadn’t been an option. It was Heaven or Hell, and God didn’t want him. He’d made it work.  
“我不想玩得太聪明。”克劳利咬牙切齿地说道。作为一个真正的信徒，亚齐拉费尔的行为有点合理——天使迫切地想要正确和善良，而无故被赶出天堂肯定会对此造成干扰。现在他们还在同一家公司工作，这真是让人烦透了。 “我不想管理地狱，我甚至不想参与——”克劳利咬紧了嘴唇，发出一声嘶嘶的声音。地狱不是这个谈话的地方。在七个月前，他自己的一方根本不是一个选择。只有天堂和地狱，而上帝并不要他。他已经设法应付过来了。

Then he’d had everything he did want, plants and movies and people to talk to. No to-do list to work through. No bosses to appease who made the exact same mistakes as Heaven, right down to not listening. He’d had a happy angel who loved him, demon and all, a happy angel in his bed, even. Then bloody Gabriel--  
然后他拥有了他想要的一切，植物、电影和可以交谈的人。没有待办事项需要完成。没有需要讨好的老板，他们犯了和天堂一样的错误，甚至连听都不听。他有一个爱他的快乐天使，包括恶魔，一个快乐的天使在他的床上。然后该死的加百列--

There was no one at the secondary exit, a battered and rotting wooden door. Everyone was massing up for Dagon’s inspirational speech.  
二号出口没有人，只有一扇破旧腐朽的木门。所有人都聚集在一起，等待达贡激励人心的演讲。

“Listen,” Azazel said. “This isn’t going to work.”  
“听着，”阿撒泽尔说道。“这行不通。”

Unbelievable. 难以置信。

“We’re not killing an eleven year-old right out of the gate,” Crowley argued.  
“我们不会一开始就杀掉一个十一岁的孩子，”克劳利争辩道。

“Oh, don’t give me that. I understand, I do. They get to you, with their stubbornness and pretty speeches, more pained by suffering than you ever remember the Almighty being and willing to use any method to stop it. Even doing good under a demon’s numbers so Heaven won’t see. Pretty soon you’re doing things you know you shouldn’t, taking foolish risks that will get you an eternity in the darkest pit if you’re caught, just to make them happy. Keep them safe.” Azazel blinked and glanced down briefly before returning to holding Crowley’s gaze, his manipulation cutting far too close to real honesty.  
"哦，别跟我扯这些。我明白，真的。他们会影响你，用他们的固执和漂亮的演讲，比你记得的全能者更加痛苦，并愿意采取任何方法来阻止它。甚至在恶魔的统治下做善事，以免被天堂发现。很快，你会做一些你知道不应该做的事情，冒险愚蠢的风险，如果被抓到，将会让你永远陷入最黑暗的深渊，只为了让他们开心。保护他们的安全。”亚撒谛眨了眨眼，短暂地低头，然后又回到了与克劳利的对视，他的操纵技巧太过接近真实的诚实。

“They wade through the worst in humanity dispensing their blessings and asking people to be kinder to each other. But you and I know how little effort creating that worst takes. Most of the time we don’t have to do anything at all.  
他们深入人性最糟糕的地方，施予祝福，并呼吁人们彼此更加友善。但你和我都知道，创造那种最糟糕的事情需要的努力是微不足道的。大多数时候，我们根本不需要做任何事情。

“You heard the officer in Tadfield,” Azazel continued, “Making golems out of mud and enochian spellcraft in his room, a dog named Demonsbane. He’s been groomed by Gabriel for this his entire life. Your Angel isn’t going to get anywhere against that. He _hasn’t_, if we’ve done this before. We need to do what we _wouldn’t_ have done before, or this all goes poof, your Aziraphale included.”  
“你听到了塔德菲尔德的警官，”阿撒泽尔继续说道，“他在房间里用泥土制造了一个傀儡，并使用了以诺语咒法，还有一只名叫恶魔杀手的狗。他一直被加百列培养着，为此付出了他整个生命。你的天使在面对这一切时无法取得任何进展。如果我们之前没有做过这件事，他也不会。我们需要做一些以前不会做的事情，否则一切都会消失，包括你的亚撒泽尔。”

Crowley opened is mouth to argue that that sort of thinking could just as easily be what they’d done before, that Azazel’s plan had just as much chances of having been a failure as Raphael’s--  
克劳利张开嘴想要争辩，认为这种思维方式可能与他们之前所做的一样，阿撒泽尔的计划同样有可能是个失败，就像拉斐尔的计划一样--

– except-- \- 除了 -

\--did it really have the same chances? Was it _just_ as likely he’d agree with Azazel, or was it more likely he’d dig in his heels? Aziraphale _was_ stubborn and he _did_ get his way most of the time, Azazel was right about that, as much as Crowley hated to admit it. Crowley had to really insist, usually more than once, for the angel to back down – even in matters of life and death. Talking to the boy was what Aziraphale wanted to do, even if Raphael had given voice to the plan.  
\-真的有同样的机会吗？他同意阿撒泽尔的可能性和他坚持己见的可能性一样大吗？阿齐拉费尔固执而且大多数时候都能按自己的方式行事，阿撒泽尔说得没错，克劳利不愿承认。克劳利通常需要坚持不懈，甚至多次要求，才能让天使让步——即使是关乎生死的事情。和那个男孩交谈是阿齐拉费尔想要做的事情，即使拉斐尔已经提出了这个计划。

His hesitance must have shown on his face, because Azazel doubled down in the softest, most beseeching voice.  
他的犹豫一定在他的脸上表现出来了，因为阿撒泽尔用最柔软、最恳求的声音再次坚持下去。

“You won’t even have to do the dirty work. I’ll take care of everything. You just have to distract him long enough for me to get close.” His face – upturned nose, soft mouth beneath his puffy-white-cloud hair – was the very picture of wide-eyed pouting. The black eyes didn’t hamper him at all.  
“你甚至不需要做那些肮脏的工作。我会处理一切。你只需要分散他的注意力，让我有足够的时间接近他。”他的脸上，翘起的鼻子，蓬松如云的头发下面柔软的嘴巴，完全符合着撅嘴大眼的形象。那双黑眼睛一点也没有妨碍他。

“All right,” Crowley capitulated. If he was to be a distraction, they needed to get the Hellhound out of the way. They’d run into Azazel and Raphael on the way to Tadfield. Hell hadn’t discovered the switched baby by then. Which meant Hastur and Ligur shouldn’t have come for Azazel at all. “Did Raphael by any chance give you any holy water ages ago?”  
"好吧，" 克劳利屈服了。如果他要成为一个干扰，他们需要把地狱猎犬赶走。他们在去塔德菲尔德的路上遇到了阿撒泽尔和拉斐尔。地狱在那时还没有发现被调换的婴儿。这意味着哈斯特和利格尔根本不应该为了阿撒泽尔而来。"拉斐尔有没有给你很久以前的圣水？"

Azazel blinked. “You’re a demon, why would you-- You really are impossible. Yes, he did.”  
阿撒谢尔眨了眨眼睛。“你是个恶魔，你为什么会……你真是不可理喻。是的，他做了。”

“Where is it?” 在哪里？

“In the fire safe in my basement,” Azazel said primly, “but we don’t have time to go back for it.”  
“在我地下室的防火柜里，”阿撒泽尔端庄地说道，“但我们没时间回去拿它了。”

“Just describe it. Container, what the safe looks like, where your place is.” Without Heaven’s asceticism to appease, Azazel wouldn’t have needed a bookshop as a cover for owning books. He’d just own them, a bold display of Covetousness that Hell would applaud. Azazel provided the requested information with skepticism, but enough that Crowley was able to build a picture in his head. Space was curved, and Hell was a little deeper inside that curve. This would have been a lot harder in Heaven.  
“只是描述一下。容器，保险柜长什么样子，你的地方在哪里。”如果没有天堂的苦修来安抚，亚撒谢尔就不需要一个书店作为拥有书籍的掩护。他只会拥有它们，这是对贪婪的大胆展示，地狱会为此鼓掌。亚撒谢尔怀着怀疑的心情提供了所需的信息，但足够让克劳利在脑海中构建出一个画面。空间弯曲，地狱在这个弯曲的内部更深一些。在天堂中这将会更加困难。

It wasn’t exactly a wormhole, but it was a little push there, a pinch there, and--  
虽然不完全是一个虫洞，但在那里稍微推一下，在那里轻轻一捏，然后——

The metal canteen appeared in Crowley’s hand. Azazel stepped backward even though the lid was rusted shut. There hadn’t been gloves or tongs in the safe, damn it all to-- well.  
金属水壶出现在克劳利的手中。阿撒泽尔向后退了一步，尽管盖子已经生锈无法打开。保险箱里没有手套或钳子，该死的。

Crowley held his breath. Cracking the lid wasn’t a problem for demonic strength, but he could _not_ spill.  
克劳利屏住呼吸。对于恶魔的力量来说，打开盖子并不是问题，但他不能溅出来。

That would take care of the Hellhound.  
那会解决地狱猎犬的问题。

“Distraction, distraction,” Crowley repeated, thinking aloud. What would distract an all-powerful entity capable of warping reality, an enemy intent on destroying the world and everything in it, while his partner and whatever he had for a weapon put together the kill-shot? Oh. He had it.  
“分心，分心。”克劳利喃喃自语。什么能够分散一个能够扭曲现实、意图摧毁世界和其中一切的全能实体的注意力，同时他的搭档和他所拥有的武器准备着致命一击？哦，他有办法了。

The thought made him smile. Humans really were the most brilliant.  
这个想法让他微笑了起来。人类真是最聪明的。

“What?” Azazel asked. “什么？” Azazel 问道。

“Dance-off to save the universe,” Crowley explained. “It’ll work, trust me. Seen it before.”  
“为了拯救宇宙而进行的舞蹈对决，”克劳利解释道。“相信我，这会奏效。我以前见过。”

“Did they remove part of your brain when you Fell?” Azazel demanded.  
“你摔倒的时候，他们有没有切除你的脑部？”阿撒泽尔要求道。

“The line is, ‘I’m going to die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy.’” Crowley opened the door and stepped through.  
“台词是：‘我将在银河系中最大的白痴们包围下死去。’” 克劳利打开门，走了进去。

It was wonderfully warm compared to the cold damp of Hell, even if it was still colder than Crowley preferred. The Meggido base looked eerily similar to Tadfield, right down to the guards at the gate not letting Book Girl inside. Gabriel’s presence with Adam was new, but not unexpected. Adam looked different, too, like a proper angel, in a slate-gray suit and professional haircut. War was wielding a primitive knife made of some kind of jaw-bone instead of a sword.  
相比于地狱的寒冷潮湿，这里温暖得令人愉快，尽管对克劳利来说仍然比他喜欢的要冷。梅吉多基地看起来与塔德菲尔德非常相似，连门口的卫兵也不让书女进去，这一点令人毛骨悚然。加百列和亚当在一起并不出乎意料。亚当看起来也不同了，像一个合格的天使，穿着石板灰色的西装，发型整齐。战争手持一把原始的刀，是用某种颚骨制成的，而不是剑。

The Hellhound – wearing an Irish Wolfhound skin – jumped at him immediately. Crowley held his breath, dumped the holy water, and leaped away. He used a wingbeat to carry him up and back from the spray. The Hellhound yelped, crying like a real dog as it melted.  
地狱猎犬——穿着爱尔兰狼犬的皮毛——立刻扑向他。克劳利屏住呼吸，倒掉圣水，然后跳开。他用翅膀的拍打力量将自己带离喷溅的水花。地狱猎犬发出尖叫，像一只真正的狗一样融化了。

Crowley landed and snapped his fingers to open the gate and hypnotize the guards.  
克劳利降落并咔嗒一声打开了大门，催眠了守卫。

“I don’t believe it,” Gabriel snarled simultaneously. “Six _thousand years_ of your mouth and your attitude and your sloppiness, and you Fall anyway.” His halberd appeared out of the aether, lightning crackling around it.  
“我不相信！”加百列咆哮着说道。“你这六千年来的嘴脸、态度和懒散，最终还是堕落了。”他的战戟从虚空中显现，周围闪电纷飞。

Shit. Fuck. Shit. He hadn’t thought about Gabriel not knowing there were two of them.  
糟糕。操。糟糕。他没想到加布里埃尔不知道有两个他们。

Crowley ran to the side, any side, just away, zig-zagging as lighting struck behind him. Gabriel was there, suddenly, and the halberd’s shaft caught him in the ribs. Crowley let the momentum take him, rolling with it, and the blade sliced hot fire from knee to ankle. Crowley scrambled, lurching up from a crawl to something somewhere between a hobble and a run.  
克劳利朝一侧跑去，任何一侧都可以，只要远离，他像闪电一样蜿蜒前进，身后传来雷鸣。加百列突然出现在那里，戟杆击中了他的肋骨。克劳利顺势滚动起来，让动力带着他滚动，刀刃从膝盖到脚踝划过，激起炽热的火焰。克劳利拼命爬起来，从爬行变成了一种蹒跚而行的状态。

The halberd caught him in the back, hard enough to numb him from the legs down, and pain enough to white out his vision.  
戟刺中他的背部，足够强烈以至于让他的双腿麻木，疼痛之剧烈甚至让他的视线变得模糊。

The deathblow didn’t come. Metal was ringing on metal in the air, and Aziraphale was babbling at him. Crowley looked up.  
致命一击没有到来。金属在空中相互碰撞，阿齐拉费尔对他喋喋不休。克劳利抬起头。

Raphael was fighting with Gabriel and-- Khizir. (He remembered their names, every one, not one of his people had Fallen but him, and wasn’t that an accomplishment?) Raphael wasn’t doing a terribly better job than Crowley had, but he at least had something other than flesh to take the blows with. Khizir’s dagger wasn’t doing much damage to an archangel, but it was enough distraction that Gabriel hadn’t taken Raphael’s head off. Crowley tried to stand. His legs didn’t move, but the pain intensified enough that he couldn’t make any sound in his scream. The sand around him was a dark red.  
拉斐尔正在与加百列和哈齐尔搏斗——（他记得他们的名字，每一个人，除了他，他的人民没有一个堕落，这不是一个成就吗？）拉斐尔的表现并不比克劳利好多少，但至少他有别的东西可以承受攻击，而不仅仅是肉体。哈齐尔的匕首对大天使来说并没有造成太大的伤害，但足以分散加百列的注意力，让他没有砍下拉斐尔的头。克劳利试图站起来，但他的腿没有动，疼痛加剧到他无法发出任何声音来尖叫。他周围的沙子变成了深红色。

Azazel was behind the Antichrist, who was watching one Raphael fighting and the other dying. The sword that wasn’t War’s took Adam square in the chest, the blade coated in blood and protruding from his ribs.  
阿撒泽尔站在反基督身后，他看着拉斐尔战斗，另一个人则在死去。那把不属于战争的剑直接刺入亚当的胸膛，刀刃上沾满了鲜血，从他的肋骨中伸出。

His face barely changed. He stared at the blade for a mute second. Adam snapped his fingers and Azazel died.  
他的脸几乎没有变化。他盯着刀刃看了一会儿。亚当弹了弹手指，阿撒泽尔就死了。

Crowley pulled them out of time. He was light-headed, and the sands here were already turning red.  
克劳利将他们从时间中拉了出来。他头晕目眩，这里的沙子已经开始变红了。

Khizir lowered her dagger to stare.  
奇兹尔放低匕首凝视着。

“What? How?” Book Girl turned in a useless circle.  
“什么？怎么回事？”书迷女孩无助地转了个圈。

“Holy fire, angel, before I bleed out.”  
圣火，天使，在我失血之前。

He could smell his own flesh searing, burnt steak and hot scales. He almost lost control of time, but he didn’t dare drop in yet. He knew what it felt like to outlive Aziraphale. With his voice crippled, his screaming hadn’t accomplished anything.  
他能闻到自己的肉烧焦的味道，烤牛排和热鳞片的气味。他几乎失去了对时间的控制，但他不敢立即放下。他知道活过亚齐拉费尔是什么感觉。喉咙受伤，他的尖叫没有取得任何成果。

“Believe me,” he rasped aloud. “You don’t want to be standing in front of a grieving archangel.”  
“相信我，”他嘶哑地说道。“你可不想站在一个悲痛的大天使面前。”

Two more breaths, and Crowley let go.  
再深呼吸两次，克劳利松开了手。

The base looked like it had been smashed by a giant fist. The buildings were leveled. War, Pollution, and Famine were lying on the ground like shattered dolls. Azazel’s sword lay in pieces on the ground. Gabriel had a broken nose. He was bleeding from his eyes and ears as well, as he pushed himself up off the buckled tarmac.  
基地看起来像是被一个巨大的拳头击碎了。建筑物被夷为平地。战争、污染和饥荒像是破碎的玩偶一样躺在地上。阿撒泽尔的剑碎成了几块。加百列的鼻子也断了。他从眼睛和耳朵流血，艰难地从弯曲的柏油路上爬起来。

Raphael was weeping, bent over Azazel’s body, one shaking hand petting his white hair uselessly.  
拉斐尔哭泣着，俯身在阿撒泽尔的身体上，一只颤抖的手无用地抚摸着他的白发。

Crowley knew better than anyone that Raphael was down for the count. He’d gone to drink in a bar and wait for death, himself.  
克劳利比任何人都更清楚拉斐尔已经被击倒了。他去了酒吧喝酒，等待死亡的降临。

Adam was utterly unharmed.  
亚当毫发无损。

“Two birds, one stone,” Adam said. He raised his hand.  
“一石二鸟。”亚当说道。他举起了手。

Aziraphale. 阿齐拉费尔。

Crowley’s legs wouldn’t work but his wings were fine. One teleport was followed instantly by another.  
克劳利的腿无法动弹，但他的翅膀却完好无损。一个瞬间的传送紧随着另一个。

The humans called it Cygnus X-3.  
人类称之为天鹅座X-3。

To Crowley, it would always be Mariel’s grave.  
对克劳利来说，那将永远是玛丽尔的坟墓。

Crowley couldn’t see him. He knew the angel was there, wings outstretched in a down-beat that would never fall. Adam’s hand was outstretched for a snap that would never come. The time dilation at the event horizon was worse than even the first creative day’s, a nanosecond stretching out into an eternity as they were pulled in. The signal to cast the spell had left one part of his brain, but it would never reach the other. For Mariel, for Adam, it was a horror that would never end.  
克劳利看不见他。他知道天使在那里，展开翅膀，永远不会落下。亚当伸出手去捏一个永远不会到来的快照。事件视界的时间膨胀比第一个创造日还要糟糕，一纳秒被拉伸成永恒，他们被吸引进去。施法的信号已经离开了他的大脑的一部分，但永远不会到达另一部分。对于玛丽尔和亚当来说，这是一个永远不会结束的恐怖。

For Crowley, the thought with no end was knowing that Adam could’t warp reality if he couldn’t think, and that Aziraphale was safe.  
对于克劳利来说，没有尽头的思考是知道如果亚当无法思考，他就无法扭曲现实，而阿齐拉费尔是安全的。

___

Aziraphale could feel his chest heaving from despair.  
亚齐拉费尔感到自己的胸膛因绝望而起伏不定。

Had Crowley teleported with no destination in mind, scattering himself in the aether? Or had he taken Adam somewhere the boy could not survive, reality-warping powers or no?  
克劳利是不是毫无目的地传送自己到虚空中？或者他是把亚当带到了一个无法生存的地方，无论有没有现实扭曲的能力？

If the Antichrist couldn’t survive, neither could Crowley. Either way, he wasn’t coming back. And Adam was dead. Apocalypse averted, but at such a higher cost. And time-- Time was still broken.  
如果反基督无法生存，克劳利也无法生存。无论如何，他都不会回来了。而亚当已经死了。世界末日被避免了，但代价却如此之高。而时间——时间仍然是破碎的。

Gabriel’s face was contorted in horror and anger.  
加布里埃尔的脸上充满了恐惧和愤怒的表情。

Aziraphale picked up a shattered piece of Raphael’s staff and held it like a blade. He stood between the two archangels. Khizir stood beside him with her dagger.  
亚齐拉费尔拾起了拉斐尔法杖的碎片，像握住一把刀一样。他站在两位大天使之间。基兹尔站在他身旁，手持匕首。

“Get out of the way, both of you,” Gabriel said.  
“让开，你们俩都让开。”加布里埃尔说道。

“This is your fault,” Aziraphale said. He could hear his voice shake, he’d never been one for confrontation, but he pressed on. “You-- you altered time and-- It’s going to all fall apart, angels and all, if you don’t fix this. You need to write a note to yourself telling yourself to stop. Please.”  
“这是你的错，”阿齐拉费尔说道。他能听到自己的声音在颤抖，他从来不喜欢对抗，但他还是坚持下去。“你——你改变了时间——一切都会崩溃，包括天使们，除非你修复这个问题。你需要给自己写一张便条，告诉自己停下来。拜托了。”

“Move aside,” Gabriel ordered again. Lightning was crackling around his arms. “I don’t want to kill the two of you.” He didn’t say he didn’t want to kill anyone. Aziraphale knew. Gabriel had wanted to kill him for stopping Armageddon in the correct timeline, and he didn’t have the history with Gabriel that Raphael had.  
“让开，”加百列再次下令。闪电在他的手臂周围闪烁。 “我不想杀了你们两个。”他没有说他不想杀任何人。亚齐拉费尔明白。加百列曾经想要杀他，因为他阻止了末日在正确的时间线上发生，而他与加百列没有像拉斐尔那样的历史。

“Then you’re going to have to go through us,” Khizir said, with really more bravado than Aziraphale thought was strictly necessary.  
“那你就得先过我们这关。”Khizir说道，比阿齐拉费尔认为的更加傲慢。

“Suit yourselves.” The lightning blast hit Khizir square in the chest and rocketed her to the side like a rag doll. Gabriel staggered. But then, he’d been the closest to Raphael, and would have taken the brunt of the scream.  
“随你们便。”闪电一击命中了哈齐尔的胸口，将她像布娃娃一样抛向一边。加百列踉跄了一下。但是，他离拉斐尔最近，本来应该承受尖叫的冲击。

Aziraphale stood his ground. He twisted, letting the shaft of the halberd fall on his shoulders, arm, and sides, but never his sword arm. He could simply wrench the weapon from Gabriel’s grip, he had the physical strength for it, but that was likely to make the archangel default to sorcery. Aziraphale did all right with minor miracles and even the occasional major one, but he didn’t have Crowley’s power or off-the-cuff creativity. Aziraphale used the makeshift sword to deflect the blows when Gabriel struck with the blade of his polearm.  
阿齐拉费尔坚守阵地。他扭动身体，让戟杆的一端落在他的肩膀、手臂和侧身上，但从不碰到他的剑臂。他本可以轻松地从加百列手中夺过武器，他有足够的体力，但那很可能会让大天使诉诸魔法。阿齐拉费尔在小奇迹和偶尔的大奇迹上表现得不错，但他没有克劳利的力量和即兴创造力。阿齐拉费尔用临时的剑来挡开加百列用戟刃打击的攻击。

Aziraphale refused to be drawn away from Raphael. He hoped that the sharp cries Aziraphale let out when the shaft struck true would snap Gabriel out of it, or at least make him see what he was doing was wrong. He tried to explain in between. Nothing seemed to be working.  
亚齐拉费尔拒绝离开拉斐尔身边。他希望亚齐拉费尔尖锐的呼喊声能够让加百列清醒过来，或者至少让他意识到自己的所作所为是错误的。他试图在两者之间解释。但似乎一切都无效。

Khizir’s dagger point appeared between Gabriel’s eyes.  
哈齐尔的匕首尖端出现在加布里埃尔的眼前。

Gabriel reached back to grab the handle-- his chest wide open.  
加布里埃尔伸手后抓住把手——他的胸膛敞开着。

He had no choice. If Gabriel killed Raphael, there would be no one to pull a message outside time, no one to stop the future, and then there’d be no future for anyone.  
他别无选择。如果加百列杀了拉斐尔，就没有人能够传递信息超越时间，也没有人能够阻止未来的发生，那么任何人都将没有未来。

Aziraphale bit his lip, and swung with the arm he’d protected, driving the broken staff as deeply into Gabriel’s chest as he could. An archangel’s weapon, on top of all the previous trauma. Gabriel dropped, and Khizir dropped as well. Most of her body was blackened and burnt. Her eyes were glassy.  
亚齐拉费尔咬着嘴唇，用他保护过的手臂挥动，尽可能深地将断裂的法杖刺入加百列的胸膛。一个大天使的武器，加上之前的创伤。加百列倒下了，哈齐尔也倒下了。她的大部分身体被烧焦和烧伤。她的眼睛呈玻璃状。

The world blurred and his eyes were burning. Aziraphale sobbed. He’d never killed anything before. It was worse than he’d ever imagined.  
世界模糊了，他的眼睛灼烧着。亚齐拉费尔哭泣着。他从未杀过任何东西。这比他想象的还要糟糕。

He pulled Khizir’s dagger from Gabriel’s head. He started sawing through the corpse’s neck. It wasn’t a note, but it would have to do.  
他从加百列的头上拔出了哈齐尔的匕首。他开始锯断尸体的脖子。虽然不是纸条，但这已经足够了。

Khizir’s distress had snapped Raphael out of it. His subordinate was half-laying in his lap and the archangel’s other hand was glowing with golden healing light. Wasting holy power he’d need, if how weak Crowley had been after the first time was any indication.  
哈齐尔的困扰让拉斐尔清醒过来。他的下属半躺在他的腿上，大天使的另一只手闪耀着金色的治愈之光。浪费了他将来可能需要的神圣力量，如果克劳利第一次之后的虚弱是个指标的话。

“No!” Aziraphale pulled his wrist away and shoved the head into his hand. “It won’t matter if history resets itself. We have to save _time_ or she’s dead anyway.”  
“不！”亚齐拉费尔抽回手腕，将头颅塞进自己的手中。“即使历史重置，也无关紧要。我们必须拯救时间，否则她无论如何都会死。”

The light of life was fading from Khizir’s eyes, and Raphael’s were dark with despair. But the archangel bit his lip and nodded.  
生命之光正在Khizir的眼中逐渐消逝，而Raphael的眼中充满了绝望。但大天使咬住嘴唇，点了点头。

“You’re right,” Raphael choked out. “I will. I promise.” Aziraphale heard wings flutter. The archangel and his grisly burden were gone, doubtless to the galactic core.  
“你说得对，”拉斐尔咽了口气，“我会的。我保证。”阿兹拉菲尔听到翅膀的拍动声。大天使和他那可怕的负担已经消失了，毫无疑问是去了银河系的中心。”

Aziraphale could hear Anathema crawling her way out of the shattered main building. It didn’t matter. It wouldn’t. His bookshop was gone, Crowley was dead, Adam was dead, Gabriel was dead at his own hand, and Khizir, who he’d barely met but still grieved on principle. Even he was dead, as Azazel.  
亚齐拉费尔听到安娜蒂玛从破碎的主楼中爬出来。这无关紧要。无所谓。他的书店不复存在，克劳利已经死了，亚当也死了，加百列是他亲手杀死的，而基兹尔，虽然他几乎没见过，但还是因原则而悲痛。甚至他也死了，作为阿撒泽尔。

He covered his face in his hands and keened.  
他用双手捂住脸，放声痛哭。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

The ring of molten star-stuff around the Milky Way’s galactic center was white at the edge of the event horizon. It faded into pink, then purple, and then a dark blue. Other stars were scattered inside the mammoth accretion disk, red giants and supergiants that could swallow Sol whole without so much as a solar flare.  
银河系中心的熔融恒星物质环在事件视界的边缘是白色的。它逐渐变成粉红色，然后紫色，最后是深蓝色。其他星星散布在巨大的吸积盘内，有红巨星和超巨星，它们可以整个吞噬太阳而不会产生太阳耀斑。

Earth was so insignificant, a speck floating around another speck. The life-forms on it were even smaller. Dust on the scales.  
地球如此微不足道，一个漂浮在另一个微粒上的微粒。其上的生命形式更加微小。鳞片上的尘埃。

Gabriel could understand how the Antichrist could lack perspective. Humans were simple, stupid, and entirely too certain of their own importance. Aziraphale and Crowley, on the other hand, should have known better. They had helped build the universe, had seen the awe of Heaven. They should have understood humanity was acceptable collateral damage to answer once and for all the question of how Heaven should be run.  
加百列能理解为什么那个反基督会缺乏洞察力。人类简单、愚蠢，对自己的重要性过于确定。而阿齐拉费尔和克劳利则应该更明白。他们曾帮助建立宇宙，见证了天堂的威严。他们应该明白，为了彻底回答天堂应该如何运行的问题，人类是可以接受的牺牲品。

But they didn’t know better, which presented a problem. The Great Plan’s portents and prophesies had passed. The door was closed. Trying to recreate the extensive timetable that had led to the events of Tadfield, well, it was impossible. Not without direct intervention from God, who seemed disinclined to participate.  
但是他们并不知道更好的办法，这就带来了一个问题。伟大计划的预兆和预言已经过去了。门已经关闭。试图重新创造导致塔德菲尔德事件的广泛时间表，这是不可能的。除非得到上帝的直接干预，但上帝似乎不愿参与。

Gabriel refused to accept that all Heaven and Hell’s work had been thwarted by the worst principality and most incompetent demon ever to disgrace God’s creation.  
加百列拒绝接受这样一个事实：天堂和地狱的一切工作都被最糟糕的统治者和最无能的恶魔所阻挠，这是对上帝创造的最大侮辱。

Gabriel couldn’t pull together a new Great Plan, but there was a chance he could salvage the old one. He couldn’t go back in time himself, of course. It would take four archangels’ worth of power to bend the laws of physics enough to send even a discorporated angel. There were only three archangels left. Sandalphon carried out the duties of an archangel, but his wings were white and he had only two sets of vocal cords. His skill at bringing Raphael’s defunct department into order didn’t give him stronger sorcery.  
加布里埃尔无法制定出一个新的伟大计划，但他有机会挽救旧计划。当然，他自己无法回到过去。即使是一个无形的天使，也需要四位大天使的力量才能足够弯曲物理定律。现在只剩下三位大天使了。桑达尔芬承担了大天使的职责，但他的翅膀是白色的，只有两套声带。他在整顿拉斐尔的废弃部门方面的能力并没有使他的魔法更强大。

The most Gabriel could do was send a note on no more than a half-ounce of paper, a word in the ear of his past self.  
加布里埃尔所能做的最多就是在不超过半盎司的纸上写下一张便条，对他过去的自己耳语一句话。

Gabriel had spent months detailing how everything had gone so wrong, reviewing surveillance files and charting cause and effect until even Sandalphon had been shooting him worried glances.  
加布里埃尔花了几个月的时间详细记录一切是如何出错的，审查监控文件并绘制因果关系图，甚至桑达尔芬也开始担心地朝他投来关切的目光。

It didn’t matter. Gabriel would only have one shot. He had to choose his target carefully.  
无关紧要。加布里埃尔只有一次机会。他必须仔细选择目标。

Aziraphale would misplace his head if it wasn’t attached to his corporation, by his own admission. He had come to Gabriel first about the swapped Antichrist and with his doubts about the war. Neither screamed “the idea man” to Gabriel.  
亚齐拉费尔承认，如果他的头不与他的身体相连，他肯定会把它弄丢。他最先向加百列提起了被交换的反基督和对战争的疑虑。对加百列来说，这两件事都不是“创意人”的表现。

Crowley, on the other hand-- Crowley had been the one to approach Aziraphale in almost every clip of surveillance they had.  
然而，克劳利则完全不同——在他们几乎所有的监控录像中，克劳利都是主动接近阿齐拉费尔的那个人。

The obvious answer was simply to erase Crowley from the narrative.  
显而易见的答案就是将克劳利从故事中抹去。

Not that “simply” was the correct word, per se. Even with his primary vocal cords scarred and his secondary and tertiary cords removed, Crowley was still a potent sorcerer. Gabriel had watched surveillance of the demon strolling across consecrated ground with nothing more than hot-foot, and Michael had sworn that the holy water hadn’t so much as caused him to steam. Separate from the immunity problem, Gabriel had seen Tadfield. One second, Crowley had been on the ground without glasses. Then the next he’d been standing two feet away from his previous position with the brat and Aziraphale next to him, a new pair of glasses on and braced for a fight. Something in that second had given that wretched child the idea to simply switch fathers.  
并不是说“简单”是正确的词，就这样说吧。即使他的主要声带被疤痕覆盖，次要和第三声带被切除，克劳利仍然是一个强大的巫师。加百列曾经观看过恶魔在受祝福的土地上漫步，只是轻轻一脚就过去了，而迈克尔发誓圣水甚至没有让他冒烟。除了免疫问题之外，加百列还见过塔德菲尔德。一秒钟之前，克劳利还没有戴眼镜躺在地上。然后下一秒，他就站在离之前位置两英尺远的地方，旁边是那个淘气鬼和阿齐拉费尔，戴着新的眼镜准备战斗。在那一秒钟里，那个可恶的孩子突然想到了换父亲这个主意。

The molecular movement trick, it had to be. Crowley had expanded it somehow, which made direct confrontation a problem.  
分子运动的诡计，不得不这样。克劳利以某种方式扩展了它，这使得直接对抗成为一个问题。

Gabriel needed to erase Crowley from the narrative without a fight.  
加百列需要在不打斗的情况下将克劳利从故事情节中抹去。

He need to make certain Crowley was never sent to the Earth to go native in the first place.  
他需要确保克劳利从未被派往地球，以免他完全融入其中。

Of course, convincing Hell to do anything was a difficult proposition. Impossible to do with only a note.  
当然，说服地狱做任何事情都是一个困难的提议。仅凭一张便条是不可能的。

But an archangel would never be assigned lowly work planetside. If he could simply keep Crowley from Falling in the first place… It meant his alternative future self would have to deal with Raphael’s chaos-mongering and mood swings, but it would be worth it for Armageddon.  
但是一个大天使永远不会被派到低贱的地方工作。如果他能够简单地阻止克劳利堕落...这意味着他的替代未来自己将不得不应对拉斐尔的混乱和情绪波动，但为了世界末日，这是值得的。

“Are you sure about this, Gabriel?” Sandalphon asked.  
“你确定这样做，加百列吗？”桑达尔芬问道。

Gabriel could feel the galactic center pulling at him. He knew the other three angels could as well. If anything went wrong, they’d know what had happened to Mariel.  
加百列能感受到银河系中心对他的吸引力。他知道其他三个天使也能感受到。如果出了什么问题，他们会知道玛丽尔发生了什么。

“Yes.” "是的。"

Gabriel placed the note in the center of their formation. The angels joined hands.  
加百列把便条放在他们的队形中央。天使们紧紧握住彼此的手。

Meddling in time was forbidden. A temporal paradox could destroy the entire universe if the loop wasn’t closed. Gabriel had left instructions to ensure his alternative future self still set events in motion, but if his alternative self didn’t follow them, or if one of the other angels’ alternative future selves balked or interfered-- The four of them had decided it was a risk worth taking. It wasn’t like they couldn’t just create the universe all over again if they had to. The right way this time.  
干涉时间是被禁止的。如果时间循环没有关闭，时间悖论可能会摧毁整个宇宙。加百列留下了指示，确保他的替代未来自己仍然推动事件的发展，但如果他的替代自己不遵循这些指示，或者其他天使的替代未来自己犹豫不决或干扰——他们四个决定这是一个值得冒险的风险。如果必要的话，他们可以重新创造宇宙。这一次，要走对的路。

The angels sang. The song was ethereal and unnatural, grating on the ears and grinding in the bones. It was slick and snotty in their throats. The light that unfurled from nothingness was a purulent yellow. It circled the note in a shell that would have ignited any mortal who looked upon it. Even though there was no air in space, the shell still reeked of putrefaction somehow.  
天使唱歌了。那首歌声飘渺而不自然，刺耳得让人毛骨悚然。它在他们的喉咙里滑腻而粘稠。从虚无中展开的光线是一种脓黄色。它环绕着音符，形成了一个壳，足以点燃任何凡人。即使在太空中没有空气，这个壳仍然散发着腐败的气息。

Raphael – gold wings, no dark glasses, navy blue suit spattered in blood – appeared out of the aether. In his hands was Gabriel’s severed head, a puncture wound right between its eyes.  
拉斐尔——金色的翅膀，没有黑色眼镜，深蓝色的西装上沾满了鲜血——从虚空中出现。他手中拿着加百列的断头，一道穿刺伤正好在眼睛中间。

Gabriel shrieked. Uriel screamed. Michael blasphemed like a demon. The song stopped. The shell dissipated.  
加百列尖叫了起来。乌列尔尖叫着。迈克尔像恶魔一样亵渎了。歌声停止了。外壳消散了。

Raphael threw the head at Gabriel. Gabriel caught it on instinct and then shoved it towards Uriel.  
拉斐尔把头扔向加百列。加百列本能地接住了它，然后将它推向乌列。

“Shall we make a list of everything you did wrong, or do you just want the highlights?” Raphael demanded.  
“我们要列出你做错的每一件事吗，还是只想听听重点？”拉斐尔要求道。

Uriel pushed the head at Michael, who held both hands up and let it float by him.  
乌里尔将头推向迈克尔，后者举起双手，让头在他身旁漂浮。

“I, uh, think we got it,” Gabriel said, watching his own head get caught in the gravity well and start floating toward the galactic core. His head. His own very dead head.  
“我，呃，我觉得我们明白了。”加布里埃尔说着，看着自己的头被引力井困住，开始朝银河核心漂浮。他的头。他自己的已经死去的头。

“No, I don’t think you do. You nearly destroyed all of time and everything in it, angels included, rather than accept that this isn’t the time for Armageddon. You will, from this point forward, babysit humanity without a fuss until the sun explodes if that’s God’s timetable.”  
“不，我觉得你并不明白。你几乎毁掉了所有的时间和其中的一切，包括天使，只是因为你无法接受现在不是世界末日的时刻。从现在开始，你将无怨无悔地照顾人类，直到太阳爆炸，如果那是上帝的时间表。”

Sandalphon swallowed and lifted his chin. “A severed head doesn’t make you the Word of God.”  
桑达尔芬咽了口水，抬起下巴说道：“一个被斩首的头颅并不能使你成为上帝的话语。”

“Excuse me,” Uriel said. “Can we? Just?” She gestured to herself, Michael, and Gabriel. “Quick conference, just need a minute.” She made beckoning gestures. Sandalphon moved with them, and Uriel held up her hand. “Not you.”  
“不好意思，”Uriel说道。“我们可以吗？就是？”她指了指自己、迈克尔和加百列。“快速开个会，只需要一分钟。”她做了个招手的手势。Sandalphon跟着他们走，Uriel举起了手。“不是你。”

“Just a minute,” Michael said as well, holding up a hand to Sandalphon. Gabriel was outvoted at that point. He let Uriel drag him along, still watching over her shoulder as his head – his _head_ – continued to float against the backdrop of the accretion disk. His severed head.  
“等一下，”迈克尔也说着，举起手示意桑达尔芬等一下。此时加百列的意见被否决了。他任由乌列尔拖着他走，仍然从肩膀上看着，他的头颅——他的头颅——继续漂浮在吸积盘的背景下。他被斩下的头颅。

“Okay, look,” Uriel said quietly. “I know I’m normally all for keeping your head down and sticking to the plan. But that’s _Raphael_, back from the damned and feeling very well, thank you, carrying Gabriel’s head. I think that before we make any decisions, we should send Metatron upstairs for some confirmation. Because if the Almighty personally un-Felled Raphael and we ignore that, we are-- in so much trouble--”  
“好吧，听着，”乌列尔轻声说道。“我知道我通常都支持低调行事，遵循计划。但那是拉斐尔，从地狱回来，感觉非常好，谢谢你，还带着加百列的头。在我们做出任何决定之前，我认为我们应该让梅塔特隆上楼确认一下。因为如果全能亲自使拉斐尔复活，而我们忽视了这一点，我们会陷入麻烦之中。”

“We’re already in trouble,” Michael hissed. “We weren’t supposed to be playing with time in the first place. I’ve watched a few human shows here and there, and they’re pretty certain you can create twins doing this timey-wimey stuff. If we’ve somehow-- created another Raphael, that isn’t a demon-- How are we going to explain this? There’s no way we can keep this a secret.”  
"我们已经惹上麻烦了，"迈克尔咬牙切齿地说道。"我们本来就不应该玩弄时间。我偶尔看过一些人类的节目，他们相当确定通过这种时光旅行的方式可以创造出双胞胎。如果我们不知怎么地创造了另一个不是恶魔的拉斐尔，我们该如何解释呢？我们无法保守这个秘密，根本不可能。"

“We can’t just kill him and hide the body!” Uriel whispered fiercely. “We don’t know if it was us or the Almighty behind this.”  
“我们不能只是杀了他然后把尸体藏起来！”乌里尔愤怒地低声说道。“我们不知道是我们还是全能者背后有什么原因。”

Ohgodohalmightyohfuck. Gabriel could feel his chest constricting with panic. This was such a bad plan. They never should have begun this plan. It had all gone so wrong. There was no way to hide it. They were in so, so, so much trouble.  
哦天哪，上帝啊，该死。加布里埃尔感到胸口因恐慌而收缩。这个计划太糟糕了。他们从来不应该开始这个计划。一切都出了问题。无法掩饰。他们陷入了如此巨大的麻烦中。

“Okay, okay,” Gabriel said. “Here’s-- Look. We come clean. Full transparency. We go straight to the First Choir, and we grovel like no one has ever grovelled before. We apologize, we beg, we cry. No shame. If Raphael is a divine messenger, that’s repentance. If we somehow did this, it’s still repentance, and maybe we all still have jobs tomorrow.”  
“好的，好的，”加百列说。“听着，我们坦白从宽。完全透明。我们直接去找第一合唱团，像从未有人这样卑躬屈膝。我们道歉，乞求，哭泣。毫不羞愧。如果拉斐尔是神的使者，那就是忏悔。如果我们某种方式造成了这一切，那也是忏悔，也许我们明天还能保住工作。”

Michael and Uriel chorused their approval for the plan. The Almighty was big on forgiveness, even if they’d been glossing over that bit with the humans lately. If Gabriel still had a job tomorrow he would have to amend that.  
迈克尔和乌里尔一起赞同这个计划。全能者非常重视宽恕，即使他们最近对人类有些忽略了这一点。如果加百列明天还有工作的话，他将不得不修正这一点。

Michael cleared his throat.  
迈克尔清了清嗓子。

“We’re going to check in with the Almighty now,” he told Raphael. “Just-- follow whenever you’re ready. No rush. Take your time. I’m sure there’s. You’re going to want your department back, obviously, of course, why wouldn’t you, so I’m sure you have preparations to make. Something. Certainly. Sandalphon.” Michael jerked his hand to indicate Sandalphon should follow them. They teleported away.  
“我们现在要与全能者联系一下，”他告诉拉斐尔。“随时跟上就好，不用着急。慢慢来。我确定你会想要重新掌管你的部门，当然，为什么不呢，所以我相信你会有所准备。某种准备。当然。桑达尔芬。”迈克尔用手示意桑达尔芬跟上他们。他们瞬间传送离开了。

Raphael closed his eyes and tilted his head up. Outside time, he had told himself that he’d deliver his message, assure himself of Gabriel’s compliance, and then spread his wings and let the gravitational pull take him. The original plan had been to send Crowley and Aziraphale forward and back. He wasn’t supposed to exist in this time.  
拉斐尔闭上眼睛，抬起头。在时间之外，他告诉自己他会传达他的信息，确保加百列的合作，然后展开翅膀，让地心引力带他离开。最初的计划是让克劳利和阿齐拉费尔来回穿梭。他不应该存在于这个时代。

He didn’t want to exist like this alone.  
他不想一个人这样存在。

But he wasn’t alone, now. Michael had handed him his job back. If he let gravity take him, Sandalphon would keep his department.  
但是现在他不再孤单了。迈克尔把他的工作还给了他。如果他让重力带走他，桑达尔芬将会保留他的部门。

Raphael felt his eyes burn, matching the burn of exhaustion in his limbs. The gravity well pulled the tears sideways off his cheeks and tugged at his hair. Without him to vent to, Khizir might have gotten herself thrown down in this timeline. If she hadn’t, she and Nanael would still be watchers. In either eventuality, Khizir hadn’t been his right hand and Nanael hadn’t been his left. It would all be so different.  
拉斐尔感到眼睛灼烧，与四肢的疲惫感相匹配。重力井将眼泪从他的脸颊上拉向一侧，还牵引着他的头发。如果没有他来倾诉，Khizir可能已经在这个时间线上被扔下了。如果她没有被扔下，她和Nanael仍然会是观察者。无论发生什么情况，Khizir都不是他的右手，Nanael也不是他的左手。一切都会如此不同。

He was still responsible. Just as he’d told Azazel, when Azazel had asked him to run if he was ever caught.  
他仍然负责。就像他告诉阿撒泽尔的那样，当阿撒泽尔要求他在被抓住时逃跑。

He could cut his hair now, if he liked. It would stay short.  
如果他愿意的话，他现在可以剪头发。它会保持短。

He would never cut it again.  
他再也不会做这件事了。

“Oh, come now, my dear. Surely you know that the reward for a job well done is being handed another person’s work to finish.”  
哦，亲爱的，来吧。你肯定知道，做得好的回报就是被交给另一个人的工作要完成。

Raphael opened his eyes. Aziraphale would have been reset along with everything else. He wouldn’t remember. He wouldn’t talk to Raphael that way. The archangel held his breath and turned around.  
拉斐尔睁开了眼睛。阿齐拉费尔应该会和其他一切一起被重置。他不会记得。他不会那样对待拉斐尔说话。大天使屏住呼吸，转过身来。

He could barely see Azazel against the dark of space, black on black, wings and clothes alike.  
他几乎看不见阿撒泽尔在黑暗的太空中，黑色与黑色相映，无论是翅膀还是衣服。

Raphael didn’t remember crossing the distance. Azazel was just in his arms, warm and soft and firm and _real_, grabbing Raphael back just as fiercely. Alive. Thank the Almighty. Alive. Hands in his hair, mouth on his, passionate and joyful and painfully, painfully wonderful.  
拉斐尔不记得穿越这段距离。阿撒泽尔就在他的怀里，温暖、柔软、坚定而真实，紧紧地抓住拉斐尔。活着。感谢全能者。活着。手在他的头发中，嘴唇相接，充满激情、喜悦和痛苦，令人难以置信的美好。

God was surprisingly good at bribery. Raphael would do anything to repay this favor.  
上帝在贿赂方面出奇地擅长。拉斐尔愿意为了回报这个恩惠而做任何事情。

Reality warped around them.  
现实在他们周围扭曲了。

“Fuck! Jesus! Fuck! Balls! What the fuck?!” a man was shouting.  
“靠！天啊！靠！蛋！他妈的是什么东西？！”一个男人大喊道。

Raphael looked up. He recognized the shape of the rooms, the narrow staircase. Azazel had taken them to his house. But of course, it wasn’t his house now. Raphael started laughing. The shouting man’s dinner had been interrupted by a filthy, blood-spattered angel and a ridiculously attractive demon, wings out and well on their way to making out, appearing out of thin air in the middle of his living room.  
拉斐尔抬起头。他认出了房间的形状，狭窄的楼梯。阿撒泽尔把他们带到了他的房子里。但当然，现在这不是他的房子了。拉斐尔开始笑了起来。那个大喊的男人的晚餐被一个肮脏的、满身鲜血的天使和一个令人荒谬地迷人的恶魔打断了，他们展开翅膀，正准备亲吻，突然从空中出现在他的客厅里。

“What the fuck is going on? What is happening?”  
“他妈的发生了什么？发生了什么事？”

Azazel snapped his fingers. The man slumped to the ground, unconscious.  
阿撒谢尔咔嗒一声响指。那个男人倒在地上，昏迷不醒。

Raphael raised his eyebrow expectantly. Azazel made a little moue with his mouth, then relented and snapped his fingers again.  
拉斐尔期待地挑了挑眉毛。阿撒泽尔撅了撅嘴，然后不情愿地再次弹了下手指。

“You will wake up having had a lovely dream about whatever you love best,” Azazel said, “_after_ we’re finished with your dwelling.”  
“当我们完成你的住所后，你将会醒来，做了一个关于你最喜欢的事情的美好梦。”阿撒泽尔说道。

Raphael pressed his mouth back to Azazel’s, smiling so hard his face ached.  
拉斐尔把嘴唇贴在阿撒泽尔的嘴上，笑得脸都疼了。

___

It was _entirely_ Crowley’s fault. Aziraphale was quite clear on that point.  
这完全是克劳利的错。阿齐拉费尔对此非常清楚。

The utterly delicious duck and the equally expensive wine Crowley had purchased to mark seven months since the Apocalypse-that-wasn’t did not change it. The prinsesstarta for dessert didn’t change it. Leaning back on the office couch, Aziraphale’s back pressed to Crowley’s chest with the demon’s chin resting on the crown of his head didn’t change it. Crowley’s his crow-black wings curled around them both like a blanket didn’t change it.  
克劳利购买的美味无比的鸭肉和同样昂贵的葡萄酒，用来庆祝自从那场未发生的启示录以来的七个月，并没有改变这一切。作为甜点的公主蛋糕也没有改变这一切。阿齐拉费尔倚靠在办公室的沙发上，背靠着克劳利的胸膛，恶魔的下巴靠在他头顶上，也没有改变这一切。克劳利那乌鸦般黑色的翅膀像一条毯子般围绕着他们两个，也没有改变这一切。

“I’m an angel,” Aziraphale finished anxiously. “I’m not supposed to be running a bookshop with my lover. You tempted me to greed _and_ lust.”  
“我是一个天使，”阿齐拉费尔焦虑地说完。“我不应该和我的爱人一起经营一家书店。是你引诱我贪婪和欲望。”

“Didn’t have to tempt very hard,” Crowley said. “You’re happy, angel.”  
“不用费太多力气就成功了，”克劳利说道。“你很开心，天使。”

Aziraphale tightened his fingers around Crowley’s. Framing it as a complaint was safer than gratitude. Still, if Crowley wanted an honest admission, Aziraphale wasn’t certain he could refuse over a-- a petty superstition, really.  
亚齐拉费尔紧紧握住克劳利的手。将其表述为抱怨比表达感激更为安全。然而，如果克劳利想要一个真诚的承认，亚齐拉费尔不确定自己能否拒绝，只是因为一种小小的迷信罢了。

“I am happy, may I be forgiven,” Aziraphale said as softly as he could and still be intelligible.  
“我很高兴，愿我得到宽恕。”亚齐拉费尔尽量轻声说道，以确保自己的话能被听清。  
He made himself breathe, even and steady, even though he didn’t want to.  
他强迫自己保持均匀而稳定的呼吸，尽管他并不愿意。

Crowley’s arms and wings tightened around him briefly, then relaxed. But there was no holy fire, no miracle snatching everything out from under him. One second became ten, then fifteen. Aziraphale relaxed, tilting his head back to rest completely on Crowley.  
克劳利的手臂和翅膀紧紧地环绕着他，然后放松下来。但没有神圣的火焰，没有奇迹将一切从他脚下夺走。一秒变成了十秒，然后是十五秒。亚齐拉费尔放松下来，把头完全靠在克劳利身上。

Outside the window, snow began to fall.  
窗外开始飘起了雪花。
