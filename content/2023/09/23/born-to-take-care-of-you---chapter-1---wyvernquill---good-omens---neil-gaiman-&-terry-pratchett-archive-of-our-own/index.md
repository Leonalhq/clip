### Chapter Text

It was a ghastly day.

All the days - a few more than seven so far, and counting - had been some measure of miserable, since God had invented rain early on, and was evidently quite taken with it.

And in the Garden\*, a woman\*\* had taken shelter under the branches of a tree.

\*It need not be specified which Garden, seeing as there had only been one of them at the time.

\*\*Likewise, we need not point out how the woman was young and dark-skinned, with curious brown eyes; after all, there were no old or pale-skinned women with watery green eyes around just yet.

A lizard was sprawled on a nearby branch, munching on something undefined. (The Esteemed Reader that has studied zoology might recognise it as a _pogona vitticeps_ , or bearded dragon.)

"Oh dear. It really is raining cats and dogs, isn't it?" Said a rather melodious voice that would one day lend itself to posh British vowels.

"What?" Answered the woman, whose name, we may divulge, was Eve.

"I said," repeated the lizard, blinking lazily over at her, "that it is raining cats and dogs."

"...I suppose." Eve peered up at the sky. "Mostly water though."

It occurred to her that, perhaps, it was unwise to speak to something that usually did not possess the ability to talk back; however, the Almighty had often addressed them through bushes and the like, so one talking lizard couldn't be so bad.

(Could it?)

The lizard chuckled softly.

"Quite, my dear." He stretched, little horns shifting with his movements, appearing more menacing than they really were. "Very observant of you."

Eve's eyes narrowed. "Are you making fun of me?"

(Despite having been on earth for only a short time span, Eve had already developed a keen sense of Looking Out For Oneself, something that Adam, the big caring lug, still struggled with.)

"Naturally not!" The lizard - as far as lizards could - looked quite affronted.

"Only, you were using the funny voice." Eve pressed. "The same that Mother uses when She's sick of me asking questions, and just wants me to be quiet."

She paused.

"She shouldn't have given me a mouth, if She didn't want me to talk."

The lizard propped his beard-like chin on one clawed paw, smirking. "Quite agree, dear girl. You really _are_ a bright one, who knew."

(Also said in a quite funny voice, but Eve carefully chose to ignore it.)

"I've been trying to embroil _the other one_ in conversation all morning," the lizard continued. "He attempted to hit me with a large stick."

"Yeah, Adam does that," she nodded. He seemed to enjoy waving things about. Eve wasn't quite sure of the appeal yet.

"Do you like him?" Said the lizard suddenly.

"Who?" Eve blinked.

"Adam."

"Oh." Eve blinked again. "Well. He's... alright."\*

\*Just like with waving sticks about, she clearly didn't see the general appeal of _men_ yet.

"Hm." The lizard seemed deeply contemplative.

"But he always does what Mother says, going around the Garden naming all the animals, and… it gets boring." Eve slumped against the bark of the tree, nudging a nearby plant with her foot until the rain collected in its leafs splashed to the ground. "Don't know what we'll do when that's all done."

"...I have an idea." Said the lizard, in the cautious way of one handing over a bomb they know damn well is ticking. "But I don't think She'd approve at all."

"Oh?" Eve blinked, but it was an eager blink now. For all that she'd been talked to in The Funny Voice, she'd never been disapproved of, and it sounded quite smashing, honestly.

"You recall, surely, the Apple Tree the Almighty instructed you never to eat from?"

"The one we're sitting under?"

The lizard blinked upwards.

"Oh. So we are. Precisely that one, yes."

"What about it?"

"Well." The lizard glanced about shiftily. "You didn't hear it from _me_ , of course… but I gather this Tree is, in fact, a Tree of Knowledge, and its fruit will let you Know.\*"

\*In more senses than one, _biblically._

Eve was intrigued.

She had so many things she wanted to understand - about how the world worked, why God had made them, and why she sometimes went tingly in her chest when Adam carried heavy things around for Her with his muscles all on display - and eating a little bit of fruit seemed the only way to understanding, seeing as Mother so categorically refused to explain any of it to her.\*

\*God simply wasn't prepared to give her the "birds and bees" talk, since She'd only just invented both, and wasn't exactly sure on the peculiars Herself just yet.

Eve reached for one of the apples… and paused.

"But… I'll be punished." She said hesitantly.

"My dear girl." The lizard gently patted the back of her rain-wet hand with his little claw-tipped paw. "Some things deserve punishment, and some do not. I am something of an expert on the matter, and I will tell you, if it were _me_ , I would decide you were absolutely blameless."

"But She's not you. Is She?" Eve pointed out very shrewdly.

The lizard was silent for a very long while.

"No." He said softly, after that very, _very_ long while; and there was something dark glimmering in his beady little eyes, a bit as if a fluffy cloud had simply evaporated beneath him, leaving him to plunge down into darkness and sulphur pits with a cry of terrified agony.

"I don't suppose She is."

Eve thought about it, long and hard.

Imagined how the rest of this endless day would go, sitting or walking around the Garden in the rain; and how the one after would be exactly like it, and the one after _that,_ too.

She wished the lizard would say something, but he was quiet again.

"I think," said Eve, reaching up to pluck an Apple from the Tree of Knowledge. "I'll take my chances with Her."

And with that, she took a bite.

And she _Knew._ \*

\*She also found she didn't really like the taste of apples, but that was entirely circumstantial.

The lizard, as much as lizards could, pulled his mouth into a quietly proud smile, gazing up to the  heavens.

"I do believe," he said, and Eve noticed his beady eyes were a bright, clear blue - the same colour as the sky would be, if it weren't overhung with dark clouds - "that the weather is clearing up."

"Hmm." Eve said, and took another bite.

And above them, the sun was indeed tentatively shining.

"Be Not Afraid." The Archangel Raphael spoke, descending from Heaven in all his glory, white robes billowing, and wings spread gloriously, and the Radiance of the Lord shining about him. "I come only to bring aid unto you, Her Children, so that-"

"About time!" Adam snapped.

"-you may- ...huh?" Raphael blinked golden eyes in confusion. "What?"

"I've been praying myself hoarse for hours!" Adam glared. "Now fix her."\*

\*Attitudes such as this would soon cause a change in Heaven's prayer-response policy, but for now, it was still mandatory to answer, at the very least with a semi-compassionate "suck it up".

He pointed to Eve, who was very obviously in terrible pain.

"Ngk," Raphael said, a little thrown. None of this had been in the angel-human encounters manual. "Yeah."

He pulled his actually very impractical wings close to his back, and ducked into the improvised little hut the two lived in.

Peered at Eve.

Cocked his head to the side, absently tugging at one radiant-copper lock of hair.

"Er." Raphael eventually muttered. "I think she's giving birth…?"\*

\*He sounded very unsure about it, not least because, for all that he was a healer of humans, he had flunked out of Heaven's human biology 101 course with a frankly embarrassing halfway grade, and had only read up on the functionalities of his own corporation far enough to learn how to do some very strange things with his tongue.

"She what?" Frowned Adam, who still thought new humans came from spare ribs the Almighty pulled out of your chest.

"You're going to be a father." Raphael took a slightly closer look, and pulled the kind of grimace outsiders often exhibited when so directly confronted with the miracle of life. "In, uh, a few minutes, I guess."

"...oh _God."\*_ Adam said, looking a little scared and a lot queasy.

\*Marking the very first instance of the Lord's Name being taken in vain, though the Esteemed Reader will surely agree it was entirely justified in this case.

Eve screamed.

"Can't you help her?" Adam urged. "Heal her?"

Raphael suddenly took great interest in his golden fingernails.

The crux of the matter was, the Almighty had been _very_ clear about having exiled the humans, and punishing Eve with this whole pregnancy lark, and how Her Great Plan was not to be disobeyed.

Surely, if people were punished so harshly, they deserved it. 

...didn't they?

An angel could get into a lot of trouble for doing the right thing at the wrong time...

"Look." Raphael began helplessly, trying not to look at either of them. "I. I ought not… don't think this is covered by prayer regulations… shouldn't..."

" _Please!_ " Adam grabbed his arm in desperation. "I _love_ her, I can't bear to watch her suffer!"\*

\*This was still before the first death of course, and it never occurred to the poor guy that humans could die at all, much less in childbed.

Raphael had heard only very little of the way humans loved each other, and if this was what it caused, he wasn't sure if he wanted any part of it.

"I'm sorry." He pried Adam's fingers away. "I mustn't."

He paused in the doorway, and discovered that he had something thoroughly impractical for an archangel: a soft heart.

"UNLESS." Raphael said, very loudly. "You've not, perchance, seen anyone wielding a pitchfork recently?"

"A what?" Adam said, because of course pitchforks hadn't been invented yet.\*

\*That task would fall to an enterprising demon who liked the posterior-stabbing potential of lances, but wished to streamline the process into three wounds per poke.

"Reddish skin?" Raphael tried. "Little horns?"

"We have a goat…?"

"Does it talk in dark tongues about sin and temptations?" Raphael pressed, desperate to make this work somehow.

"No." Adam frowned. "It just bleats. What's that got to do with anything?"

Raphael groaned softly.

"Look." He began, rather more patiently than the situation rightly deserved. "Has there been anything, _anything at all,_ that was out of the ordinary or, _in_ _some obscure, far-fetched way,_  sinister? Even a little bit?"

(The way Raphael saw it, Heaven could _hardly_ object if he were thwarting some potential demonic wile, could they?

He would have to act as quickly as possible - and therefore naturally be unable to inquire whether the Great Plan allowed for it - to counteract demonic involvement with the First Birth, of course. One or two preventative miracles on Eve, and maybe his hand slipped into a bit of healing, muscle memory, whoops-a-daisy.

All perfectly reasonable.

Would be a real feather in his wing, too.)

Adam thought.\*

\*This wasn't exactly easy for him. Adam was a sterling guy, certainly, but not exactly the greatest thinker of his age, no matter how little competition there currently was.

"Well…" he began slowly. "There's that talking lizard Eve likes to speak wi-"

"Good enough, I'll take it." Raphael interrupted, pushing past him with an industrial-strength healing miracle already brewing in his Angelic Soul, and making only the smallest mental note to follow up on the unusually chatty reptile population around these parts.

For now, though, he had a child to deliver.

___

Eve, nursing her newborn at her breast, glared.

And glared.

And _glared._

"Would it help," asked the lizard guiltily, "if I said that I think this whole birthing matter is a cruel and unusual punishment for merely letting a friendly neighbourhood reptile talk you into a healthy little snack?"

"No," Eve said through gritted teeth, "it would _not._ "

"Ah." The lizard looked even more guilty. "An apology then?"

Eve's glare intensified.

"...no?"

"Do you know how _painful_ that was!?" Eve snapped.

"Roughly like your angelic essence burning away, and hitting the boiling sulphur pool hard after an eternal Fall?" The lizard suggested.

"Worse _._ "

"Oh dear."

" _Yes._ "

They were silent for a while.

"I really _am_ sorry." Said the lizard earnestly.

"I know." Eve sighed. "It's alright."

More silence.

The baby fussed, and the lizard acquired a look in his eyes that was half the urge to coo, and half surprise that he had such impulses at all.

"Would you like to hold him?" Eve offered.

The lizard met her eyes with a raised brow, which was as tiny and lizard-like as the rest of him, and Eve realised how stupid a question that had been.\*

\*Probably miracle residue making her a hint loopy.

"Sorry. Didn't think-"

"No, no." The lizard interrupted her thoughtfully. "If you would give me a moment or two..."

He seemed to concentrate.

Nothing happened.

"I am working on it." The lizard muttered in a strained voice. "Where is your man\*, by the way?

\*Even if Adam was the only one currently in existence, he was still most certainly _her_ man, whether the clarification was needed or not _._

"He said he'd go milk the goats\* six hours ago." Eve shrugged. "It's alright, he can look after himself."

\*Even though this sounded a lot like the pre-civilisation version of going to the shops to buy cigarettes (and never returning), Adam was indeed merely busy milking the goats, the delay due to pausing continuously to mutter _"we have a son"_ in a dazed-yet-pleased voice over and over.

"I'm sure he can." The lizard muttered, and suddenly was no longer a lizard.

Where there had been a reptile only moments ago, there now sat a man-shaped being, with bright blue eyes and wickedly sharp lizard claws, and draped in a robe of the same sandy tone as the bearded dragon's leathery skin.

It should be noted that the wings extending from his back were substantially better-groomed than Raphael's, and aside from that, very similar in shape.

"Huh." Said Eve, looking him up and down. "I thought you'd be younger, Azirafell."

___

"...Azirafell." Raphael muttered to himself, tapping one nail distractedly against the file. "Also: Baron Fell. Master of Eternal Torments, suspected of Tempting Eve into committing the First Sin. Demonic Aspect: Lizard (Bearded Dragon). Assigned corporation:T372=b, only lightly corrupted in the Fall."

He frowned.

"Baron Fell. What _are_ you doing, messing about with humans and earth?"

___

"For your information, dear girl, I was assigned this." Azirafell huffed, wriggling slightly in the unfamiliar body. "There's not been much freedom of choice, obviously."

"Obviously." Eve echoed, and then held the baby out to him.

Azirafell took him from her arms with a gentleness she wouldn't have expected from someone with two-inch claws on all of his fingers, cradling the little thing in the crook of his arm.

"We were thinking of calling him Cain." Eve informed him.

Azirafell hummed.

"Very modern sound, Cain, really."

Another hum, and a gaze at the baby that was nothing short of besotted.

Eve continued studying him.

"Are you all that… milk-coloured?" She finally asked.

"Hm?" Azirafell blinked.

"Your colleague was the same. It's very odd-looking, you know."

"Colleague?"

"The one who helped me with the birth. He was one of… your people."

Blue eyes narrowed. "Describe him to me."

"Wings like yours," Eve began. "And… he looked a little more like Adam in body, but hair as long as mine. And red."

"His skin?"

"No, his hair."

"Ah."

"And he had a little snake here." Eve touched her finger to the side of her face. "He was quite helpful, in the end. If he ever comes back, I'll ask him if he wants to join you in being one of Cain's godfathers. He isn't a friend of yours, is he?"

Now, at this point, we must clarify something for the Esteemed Reader:

Eve, kept lamentably out of the loop of Heavenly politics by the Almighty, did not actually know to distinguish between angels and demons.

In part, this was because Azirafell was the only demon she had ever met, and with his very similar - just fewer - wings and colouring as Raphael, he didn't exactly strike her as "not-like" him, or the angels she had seen patrolling the Walls of Eden.

Azirafell, firstly, assumed she _was_ aware of the distinction; and, secondly, he was _quite_ sure that Heaven would stick firmly to their policy of non-interference when it came to those Fallen from grace and exiled from the Garden.

Thus, the conclusion he jumped to was perfectly understandable.

"Not yet," Azirafell said, vowing to find out which minor snake demon - because why would an _angel_ defy Heaven by aiding the exiled humans against Her will!? - had assisted Eve, and to promptly befriend him. "But he will be."

He had a feeling they could be the very best of friends, him and that fellow demon.
