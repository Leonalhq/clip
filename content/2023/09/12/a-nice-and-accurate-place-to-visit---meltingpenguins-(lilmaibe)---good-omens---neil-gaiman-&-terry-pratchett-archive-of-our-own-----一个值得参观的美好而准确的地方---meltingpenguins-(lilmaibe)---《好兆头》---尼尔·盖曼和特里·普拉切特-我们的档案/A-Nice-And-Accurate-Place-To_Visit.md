### Chapter Text 章节正文

**Mayfair, London - Two months ago  
伦敦梅费尔区 - 两个月前**

There had been a number of things Crowley and Aziraphale had fretted over these past two years.  
在过去的两年里，克劳利和阿齐拉费尔一直为许多事情而烦恼。

It _should_ have been nice, what with Heaven and Hell leaving them alone, but the prospect of their respective - they both avoided saying former, oddly enough - head offices possibly finding out about their little stunt had put quite a damper on any positive sentiment they might have had.  
本来应该很好的，毕竟天堂和地狱都不再干涉他们，但是一想到他们各自的总部可能会发现他们这个小把戏，就让他们的积极情绪大打折扣。

But neither Crowley nor Aziraphale had any idea what to do about it.  
但是克劳利和阿齐拉费尔都不知道该怎么办。

And maybe that was a good thing.  
也许那是件好事。

Because, had they, for example, been so ascertained in their superiority over their head offices, had they taken too much pride in how they fooled Heaven and Hell, or had they simply deemed the other beings of angel-stock too stupid to catch on, what was about to happen might have gone very sideways for them.  
因为，如果他们对自己在总部的优越性有所确信，如果他们为自己如何愚弄天堂和地狱感到过于自豪，或者他们只是认为其他天使族的生物太愚蠢而无法察觉，那么即将发生的事情可能会对他们产生非常不利的影响。

It was evening, and Crowley had draped himself over his couch, watching some game shows (he had to admit he still felt very proud about their creation, and there was a certain pang of nostalgia when he thought about stuff he had done for Hell), while Aziraphale was busying himself with some crossword puzzle next to him.  
天色已晚，克劳利懒散地躺在沙发上，看着一些游戏节目（他不得不承认，对于这些节目的创造，他仍然感到非常自豪，每当他想起自己为地狱所做的事情时，总会有一种怀旧的心情），而阿齐拉费尔则在他旁边忙着解一道填字游戏。

"A study of animals so specialized it did away with irrelevant letters, six across," the angel murmured at some point.  
天使在某个时刻低声说道：“一项对动物进行的如此专业化的研究，它摒弃了无关的字母，横跨六个格子。”

Crowley turned his head. "What sort of clue is that?"  
克劳利转过头。“这是什么样的线索？”

Aziraphale shrugged. 亚齐拉费尔耸了耸肩。

Crowley was about to respond - even if it was just for the sake of responding - when the doorbell rang.  
当门铃响起时，克劳利正准备回应，即使只是为了回应而已。

The two supernatural beings looked at each other.  
两个超自然的存在相互看着对方。

"Are you expecting anyone, dear?" asked Aziraphale.  
"亲爱的，你在等人吗？"阿齐拉费尔问道。

"No?" tried Crowley, moving himself off the couch and towards the door. "Maybe it's one of the neighbours."  
“不是吗？”克劳利试着从沙发上站起来，朝门口走去。“也许是邻居之一。”

It wasn't. 不是的。

Instead it was someone that made Crowley take off his glasses, blink, go 'Ngk!' and slam the door in their face. Or tried to.  
然而，这次却是有人让克劳利摘下眼镜，眨了眨眼，发出一声“嗯！”然后狠狠地把门关上。或者说是试图这样做。

They caught the door before that.  
他们在那之前抓住了门。

"Crowley." Dagon smiled toothily. "Such a shame to see you in good health."  
"克劳利。"达贡露出了一口尖牙的笑容。“真可惜看到你身体健康。”

"What... do you want?" Crowley began slowly, weighing his chances. Dagon was an amazingly clever demon, but rarely ever ventured topsides. This had to be serious.  
“你……想要什么？”克劳利缓慢地开始说道，权衡着自己的机会。达贡是一个极其聪明的恶魔，但很少涉足地上世界。这一定是件大事。

"Ah, just a few..." 啊，就几个而已...

"I believe we had agreed on you lot leaving us alone." Aziraphale had stepped to Crowley's side, glowering.  
我相信我们已经达成了你们离开我们的共识。”亚齐拉费尔走到克劳利身旁，怒视着对方。

"Exactly the point we're on about," said another voice, and Uriel peeked her head around the door.  
另一个声音说道：“这正是我们关注的重点。”乌列尔探出头来，从门口张望着。

"'Tis really just a formality." Dagon beamed, pulling a grubby manila folder from her satchel.  
“这只是一个形式而已。”Dagon笑容满面，从她的背包里拿出一个脏兮兮的文件夹。

"Formality?" said Crowley.  
"正式吗？" 克劳利说道。

"What do you mean?" finished Aziraphale.  
“你是什么意思？”阿齐拉费尔说完。

"Ah, we just need you," Dagon whacked a finger at Crowley, "to sign something. Bureaucratic procedure, y'understand."  
“啊，我们只需要你，”达贡用手指戳了戳克劳利，“签个文件而已。官僚程序，你懂的。”

"Same issue for you, Aziraphale." Uriel had meanwhile pulled out a pristine folder from her own bag. "Mind if we come in?"  
"阿兹拉菲尔，你也有同样的问题。"乌里尔从自己的包里拿出一个完好无损的文件夹。"我们进来可以吗？"

"Yes," said Aziraphale darkly.  
“是的。”亚齐拉费尔阴沉地说道。

Dagon and Uriel looked at each other, and smiled.  
达贡和乌里尔相互对视，微笑着。

"Shame," said Uriel. "可惜," Uriel 说道。

"Really a shame," added Dagon. "You'd think they'd want t'know 'bout _that_."  
"真是可惜啊，"达贡补充道。"你会觉得他们应该想知道这件事的。"

"Ah, I guess 'Leave us alone' _does_ include 'Don't give us any heads up about significant changes in our lives'. We really just wanted to inform you. Shame, really."  
啊，我猜“让我们一个人呆着”确实包括“不要提前告诉我们生活中的重大变化”。我们只是想通知你而已。真可惜。

"Aye, as much as you'd deserve that nasty surprise you got comin'. But, if y'dun wanna hear it, then we can't do nothing for you," said Dagon, and let go of the door. "Shame 'bout yer car, Crowley."  
“哎呀，你真该得到那个讨厌的惊喜。但是，如果你不想听，我们也没办法帮你了。”达贡说完，松开了门。“克劳利，你的车真可惜。”

"And the book shop," said Uriel, contemplatively.  
"还有那家书店，"乌里尔沉思地说道。

"Oh, and the Ritz of course." Dagon grinned from ear to ear. "But yer right. We said we'd leave y'alone, so yer prob'ly not interested anyways. Be seein' ya."  
"哦，当然还有丽兹酒店。"达贡笑得合不拢嘴。“不过你说得对。我们说过会让你一个人呆着，所以你可能也没兴趣。再见了。”

And she and Uriel turned to go.  
她和乌里尔转身离开。

Crowley slowly closed the door, and looked at Aziraphale.  
克劳利慢慢地关上门，看着阿齐拉费尔。

"We're not going to fall for that," he said.  
他说：“我们不会上当的。”

"Absolutely not. Ridiculous," said Aziraphale.  
“绝对不行。荒谬。”阿齐拉费尔说道。

They nodded at each other, and turned back to the living room.  
他们互相点了点头，然后转身回到客厅。

And back around, pulling the door open.  
然后转身，拉开门。

"What do you mean by that?" hollered Aziraphale. Unnecessarily as it turned out, as Dagon and Uriel were waiting next to the door.  
“你是什么意思？”阿齐拉费尔大声喊道。结果证明这样做并不必要，因为达贡和乌列尔已经站在门旁边等着了。

"No need to shout, Aziraphale," said Uriel, sashaying past him and Crowley, Dagon on her heels. "You will only alarm Crowley's neighbours for no reason."  
“不用大声喊，阿齐拉费尔。”乌列尔说着，优雅地从他和克劳利身边走过，达贡跟在她的后面。“你只会无故惊动克劳利的邻居。”

They sat down on the couch, watching rather smugly as Crowley and Aziraphale stalked stiffly after them.  
他们坐在沙发上，得意地看着克劳利和阿齐拉费尔僵硬地跟在他们后面。

"It's really just a small formality," said Uriel, while Crowley miracled up a second, matching couch for himself and Aziraphale.  
“这只是一个小小的形式上的事情而已。”Uriel说道，而Crowley则神奇地为自己和Aziraphale创造了一张相配的第二张沙发。

"All nice and dandy," complained Crowley. "But what did you mean with 'Shame about all that stuff'?"  
“一切都很好，”克劳利抱怨道。“但是你说的‘可惜那些事情’是什么意思？”

Uriel and Dagon laid down the open folders.  
乌里尔和达贡放下了打开的文件夹。

"Over the past two years both of you have continued using miracles to get through everyday life." Uriel pointed at a list on top of her folder's content. "Emptying tables at the Ritz, clearing park benches, making human customers uncomfortable... A lot of selfish, frivolous miracles, Aziraphale."  
在过去的两年里，你们俩都继续使用奇迹来度过日常生活。乌里尔指着她文件夹上方的一张清单说道：“在丽兹酒店清理餐桌，整理公园长椅，让人类顾客感到不舒服……很多自私、轻浮的奇迹，阿齐拉费尔。”

"Maintaining a car, cleaning up bookshelves, playing music not available on a record on a record player," Dagon picked up the conversation before Crowley or Aziraphale could protest. "Lotsa selfish, but overall too jolly good miracles."  
在克劳利或阿齐拉费尔能够提出抗议之前，达贡接过话题说：“保养汽车，整理书架，用唱片机播放无法在唱片上找到的音乐，这些都是有点自私，但总体来说是非常棒的奇迹。”

Aziraphale sat up straight, folded his hands, and furrowed his brow.  
亚齐拉费尔挺直身子，双手交叉，皱起了眉头。

"With that little show you just put on I doubt this is merely about a missed quota. Especially since we are not in active service," he paused, "or _any_ service at all, anymore."  
刚才你表演的那一出，我怀疑这不仅仅是因为一个未达到的指标。尤其是我们已经不再处于活跃状态，"他停顿了一下，"或者说已经完全不再从事任何工作了。"

Dagon grinned and looked at Uriel.  
达贡咧嘴一笑，看着乌列尔。

"Lookit, he's clever. You're right, Principality. Hit the nail right on the head. That's what we're here about."  
看，他很聪明。你说得对，Principality。一针见血。这就是我们在这里的原因。

"Come again?" asked Aziraphale darkly.  
"再说一遍？"阿齐拉费尔阴沉地问道。

"You're not being in any form of service anymore," said Uriel with a smile so thin you could thread a needle with it. "Yet you have used up significant resources of Heaven. And Hell, respectively." She nodded at Crowley. "You do know there is only a limited amount until it all needs to be replenished."  
"你已经不再提供任何形式的服务了，"Uriel微笑着说道，笑容如此微弱，以至于你可以用它穿过针眼。"然而，你已经消耗了天堂的大量资源。相应地，也消耗了地狱的资源。"她向克劳利点了点头。"你应该知道，这些资源是有限的，最终都需要重新补充。"

"There's more than enough, no matter what we do," snarked Crowley, squirming a little. He had an inkling where this was going, and he couldn't say he liked the scenery on the way there.  
“无论我们做什么，都绰绰有余。”克劳利嘲讽地说着，微微扭动着身体。他对接下来的情况有点心知肚明，但他不能说他喜欢前进的路上的风景。

"Certainly," confirmed Uriel. "But you know as well that it is all tied to a bureaucratic process, meaning each time you do a miracle to get your toast the right kind of toasted instead of just fiddling with the toaster's setting..."  
"当然，" Uriel 确认道。"但你也知道这一切都与官僚程序有关，这意味着每次你为了让你的吐司烤得恰到好处而不仅仅是调整烤面包机的设置时，都需要进行一次奇迹般的操作..."

"The knob comes off when I try that," Aziraphale protested.  
“我试了一下，把把手拧下来了。”亚齐拉费尔抗议道。

"And y'dun go an' miracle that fixed?" jeered Dagon. Aziraphale went bright pink.  
"你竟然还能神奇地修好了？" 达贡讥笑道。亚齐拉费尔脸红了起来。

"In any case," said Uriel, "Heaven and Hell have decided that this situation won't do. Thus you will be cut off the respective resources."  
乌里尔说：“无论如何，天堂和地狱都决定这种情况不可行。因此，你将被剥夺相应的资源。”

Aziraphale and Crowley stared at each other. Then Crowley let out a howl.  
亚齐拉费尔和克劳利相互凝视着。然后克劳利发出一声嚎叫。

"I knew it!" he wailed. "I knew you were going for that." He sank deeper into the pillows.  
"我就知道！"他哀嚎道。"我就知道你会这样做。"他深深地陷入了枕头中。

Aziraphale, meanwhile, shook his head.  
而与此同时，阿齐拉费尔摇了摇头。

"This won't do." 这样不行。

"And, pray tell, why not, Aziraphale?" asked Uriel, leaning forward. "Because it's not fair? Was mocking Heaven fair?"  
“那么，阿齐拉费尔，为什么不呢？”乌列尔向前倾身问道。“因为这不公平吗？嘲笑天堂公平吗？”

"Was takin' away the only bit o' hope Hell had left fair?" added Dagon, leaning back.  
达贡倚在椅背上，补充道：“这是夺走了地狱最后一丝希望吗？”

"Or is it because it's unpreceded?" Uriel continued. "So is stopping Armageddon, no matter how you try to excuse it, or what reasons you might have had."  
"还是因为这是前所未有的呢？"乌里尔继续说道。"所以，无论你如何辩解，或者你可能有什么理由，阻止末日的到来都是必要的。"

Aziraphale pinched the bridge of his nose.  
亚齐拉费尔捏了捏鼻梁。

"There is no getting out of it, is there?" he asked, reluctantly. Crowley jumped up.  
他勉强地问道：“这事情没法逃避了，对吧？”克劳利跳了起来。

"No... no no no. There has to be catch." He whacked his finger at the two visitors. "You people would not be here just to tell us about this. Spill it."  
"不...不不不。肯定有陷阱。"他用手指戳着两位访客说道："你们不会只是为了告诉我们这个而来的。说出来吧。"

Dagon flashed him a grin and sat back up as well, while Uriel moved the first page in Heaven's folder to the side.  
达贡露出了一个笑容，也重新坐直了，而乌列尔则将天堂文件夹的第一页移到了一边。

"You're more clever than you let on. Indeed, we came here to give you a choice. You can sign this," she tapped a finger on the first document, "continue being left alone by Heaven and Hell, going about your lives in peace until the Apocalypse happens, but you will be doing so without any miracles."  
你比你表现出来的聪明多了。确实，我们来这里是为了给你一个选择。你可以签署这份文件，"她用手指敲击着第一份文件，"继续被天堂和地狱放任不管，安享平静的生活直到世界末日的到来，但是你将没有任何奇迹可言。

"Also, no new bodies should y'manage to get discorporated," Dagon added, and shoved Hell's folder with another document to Crowley. "Or you can sign _that_, an' return to active field agent service."  
"此外，不应该有新的身体被解体，"达贡补充道，并将地狱的文件夹连同另一份文件推给克劳利。"要么你签字，然后回到现役特工岗位。"

Now Crowley pinched the bridge of his nose.  
现在克劳利捏了捏鼻梁。

"Excuse us for a second," he said, and dragged Aziraphale with him into the bedroom.  
"不好意思，稍等一下，" 他说着，然后把阿齐拉费尔拖进了卧室。

"I can't believe this," Crowley lamented. "Are they for real?"  
"我简直不敢相信," 克劳利叹息道。"他们是认真的吗?"

"They look very real to me, and..."  
在我看来，它们看起来非常真实，而且...

Crowley gave his angel a long, cool look.  
克劳利给了他的天使一个冷冷的目光。

"You know that's a figure of speech, angel, and I know that you know."  
你知道那是个修辞方式，亲爱的，而且我知道你知道。

Aziraphale sighed. 亚齐拉费尔叹了口气。

"I'm sorry, dear. This is just..." With a heavy sigh he sat down on the bed.  
"亲爱的，对不起。这只是..."他沉重地叹了口气，坐在床上。

"Yeah, I know," said Crowley, sitting down next to him. "What are we gonna do now?"  
“是的，我知道。”克劳利说着，坐在他旁边。“现在我们该怎么办？”

They sat in silence for a while, each of them waiting for the other to say how ridiculous this was, and how there had to be a way out.  
他们默默地坐了一会儿，每个人都在等待着对方说出这是多么荒谬，以及必须有一种解脱的办法。

"Do you think they know about our little exploit?" Aziraphale asked instead. Crowley harrumphed.  
“你觉得他们知道我们的小把戏吗？”亚齐拉费尔反问道。克劳利哼了一声。

"Would we still be here then? Naw, we're good about that."  
我们还会在这里吗？不，我们对此很满意。

Aziraphale nodded grimly.  
亚齐拉费尔默默点头。

"You know, Crowley," he began slowly, causing Crowley to lean forward to look at him just as slowly.  
你知道，克劳利，"他慢慢地开始说道，导致克劳利也慢慢地向前倾身看着他。

"Angel, don't say it," he went. "I know what you are going to say, I had the same thought, and as long as neither of us says it out lou-"  
"天使，别说了，"他说道。"我知道你要说什么，我也有同样的想法，只要我们两个都不说出来-"

"We are both not too happy with this situation after all, aren't we?"  
我们毕竟都对这种情况不太满意，是吧？

"Oh for Somebody's sake!" Crowley muttered, slumping back onto the bed.  
"哎呀，为了某人的缘故！" 克劳利嘟囔着，无力地倒在床上。

"I'm right, am I not?"  
我是对的，不是吗？

"Obviously. Yeah, yeah, alright. The whole thing took the bite out of things, I admit to that. And I kinda _do_ miss some things."  
显然。是的，是的，好吧。整件事情让人有些失去了兴致，我承认。而且我有点想念一些东西。

"So... do I." "那么...我也是。"

"And hey, at least we can be honest about each other, right?"  
"嘿，至少我们可以对彼此坦诚相待，对吧？"

Aziraphale smiled softly and gave Crowley's hand a squeeze.  
亚齐拉费尔轻轻地微笑着，握紧了克劳利的手。

"Shall we go then?" 那我们就走吧？

Crowley nodded and got up.  
克劳利点了点头，站了起来。

"Better than the alternative. I mean, I have a flat full of plants just waiting to strangle me."  
比起其他选择来说还是好一些。我的意思是，我家里堆满了等着勒死我的植物。

"Maybe you _should_ start treating them better."  
也许你应该开始更好地对待他们。

"Aziraphale... I don't need more proof that getting back into active service's the better choice."  
亚齐拉费尔...我不需要更多证据来证明重新投入到积极服务中是更好的选择。

That was two months ago.  
那是两个月前。

Since then things had slowly settled. There had been one or two small appointments for each of them, a bit of report writing here, a bit of catching up with some quota there.  
从那时起，事情慢慢地稳定下来了。他们每个人都有一两个小任务，这里写一份报告，那里完成一些指标。

Only the possibility that Heaven or Hell (or both) caught on to what had happened at the trials remained a - dwindling - source of worry.  
只剩下天堂或地狱（或两者皆有）察觉到审判中发生的事情的可能性，成为了一个日益减少的担忧源泉。

But overall it was far more relaxed than Crowley and Aziraphale had expected.  
但总体来说，这比克劳利和阿齐拉费尔预期的要轻松得多。

Far, far more relaxed.  
更加轻松自在。

**Mayfair, London - Now  
伦敦梅费尔区 - 现在**

Crowley was reclining in the bath, with the radio noodling out some opera. He was so at peace with things that it took him more than one moment to register when the singer suddenly addressed him directly.  
克劳利正在浴缸里悠闲地躺着，收音机里传出一些歌剧的曲调。他如此安心，以至于花了一段时间才意识到歌手突然直接对他说话。

CROWLEY! 克劳利！

Crowley did a double take, splashing water everywhere, blessing in several tongues as he hit his leg against the faucet.  
克劳利猛地一愣，水四溅，他撞到水龙头时用几种语言祝福着自己的腿。

"Yes?" Then it fully sank in that Hell was contacting him like this for the first time since he was back on their payroll. "Yes, Lord?" he quickly corrected himself. Better safe than sorry.  
"什么事？" 然后他完全意识到，自从他重新回到他们的薪水单上以来，地狱第一次这样联系他。 "是的，主人？" 他迅速纠正了自己。 安全第一。

WE SEE YOU ARE ENJOYING YOURSELF, CROWLEY. MUST BE NICE TO BE CERTAIN THE BATH ONE'S IN IS BUT A BATH.  
看来你玩得很开心，克劳利。能够确定自己所处的浴缸只是个浴缸，一定很不错。

Crowley paled and blessed silently as he sank into the water. They _had_ caught on.  
克劳利苍白地沉入水中，默默祈祷着。他们已经察觉到了。

_Bugger 该死_

WE HAVE A TASK FOR YOU, CROWLEY.  
克劳利，我们有一个任务给你。

"A... task?" That wasn't what he had expected upon Hell learning about their little stunt. He had expected instant annihilation. Granted a _task_, compared to an appointment, probably meant annihilation in small, painful doses.  
"一个...任务？" 这不是他在地狱得知他们的小把戏后所期待的。他原以为会立即被消灭。虽然相比于约定，被分配一个任务可能意味着分批、痛苦的消灭。

Yeah, that sounded about right.  
是的，听起来差不多。

INDEED. IT IS A CHANCE TO PROVE YOURSELF WORTHY OF A CONTINUED EXISTENCE AFTER WHAT YOU DID. USE IT WISELY. HERE ARE YOUR INSTRUCTIONS.  
确实。这是一个机会，证明你值得继续存在，尽管你所做的事情。明智地利用它。这是你的指示。

Crowley groaned. Still with the pouring knowledge into his brain. Couldn't they just send him a textmessage? They knew how to do that by now, didn’t they? He pondered the new information.  
克劳利呻吟着。他的大脑仍然被知识灌输着。他们难道不能给他发个短信吗？他们现在应该知道怎么做了，不是吗？他思考着这些新的信息。

"Umm, Lord?" "嗯，大人？"

YES? 是的？

"I... think something went wrong? I only got a time from you, but nothing..."  
我...觉得出了点问题？我只收到了一个时间，但什么都没有...

AND YOU'D BETTER BE NOT BE LATE.  
你最好不要迟到。

Crowley sighed softly and submerged himself.  
克劳利轻轻地叹了口气，然后沉入水中。

UNDERSTOOD? 明白了吗？

He came back up again.  
他又回来了。

"Understood, Lord." 明白，主人。

AND CROWLEY? 克劳利呢？

"Yes?" "是吗？"

DO NOT SPEAK TO THE ANGEL OF THIS, OR THE DARK COUNCIL MIGHT RECONSIDER THEIR DECISION. AND YOU DO NOT WANT THEM TO DO THAT, DO YOU?  
不要和天使谈论这个，否则黑暗议会可能会重新考虑他们的决定。而你不想他们这样做，对吗？

"...No, Lord." "不，主啊。"

GOOD. 好的。

Crowley turned off the radio before the singer had come back fully.  
克劳利在歌手完全回来之前关掉了收音机。

Shit, shit, _shit_! He should have known things wouldn't stay so relaxed. That wasn't what he had meant by him missing some things.  
该死，该死，该死！他应该知道事情不会一直这么轻松。这不是他所说的错过一些东西的意思。

He submerged himself again, brooding and pondering. 'Do not speak to the angel' they had said.  
他再次沉浸其中，沉思默想着。他们曾说过：“不要与天使说话。”

If they felt like making that extra clear, Crowley thought gloomily, there wasn't much of a choice.  
克劳利沮丧地想，如果他们觉得有必要再明确一下，那就没有太多选择了。

He came back up, dark hair clinging to his face.  
他重新站了起来，黑发贴在脸上。

Well, Hell had only forbid him from talking about this task with Aziraphale, not from just talking to the angel.  
嗯，地狱只是禁止他与阿齐拉费尔谈论这个任务，而并非禁止他与天使交谈。

~⧖~

It had been a good plan.  
这是一个很好的计划。

It would have been even better had it accounted for Aziraphale being in a sour mood when Crowley arrived at the book shop.  
如果它考虑到了克劳利抵达书店时阿齐拉费尔心情不好的话，那就更好了。

"You have quite the _nerve_, my dear," the angel began as he stopped Crowley at the door. He glowered a little. "Leaving me standing like that."  
“亲爱的，你真是胆子不小。”天使在门口拦住克劳利，开始说道。他有些不悦地瞪了一眼，“竟然让我站在那里。”

Crowley cocked his head. "Pardon?"  
克劳利歪了歪头。“请再说一遍？”

Aziraphale tried to glower more intensely, pursing his lips into a pout. "Oh, you know what I'm talking about."  
亚齐拉费尔努力地愤怒地瞪着眼睛，嘴唇紧抿成一个噘嘴。“哦，你知道我在说什么。”

Crowley cocked his head further, now tilting his entire upper body. "I swear to Go- Sa-...," he pulled himself together, "I swear on the Bentley I don't."  
克劳利进一步歪了一下头，现在连上半身都倾斜了。"我发誓，我发-...，"他振作起来，"我发誓以本特利为证，我没有。"

Aziraphale crossed his arms and gave him a scrutinizing glare.  
亚齐拉费尔双臂交叉，投以一道审视的目光。

"This won't do, Crowley."  
这样不行，克劳利。

"What?" Crowley frowned softly. "Look, can I at least come in _for a moment_ to learn what I supposedly did?"  
“什么？”克劳利微微皱眉。“听着，我能不能至少进来一会儿，了解一下我到底做了什么？”

The angel pondered this, shifting his weight from one foot to the other.  
天使沉思着，将重心从一只脚移到另一只脚上。

"Oh, alright," he finally said and stepped aside.  
"哦，好吧，" 他最终说道，然后让开了。

Good. At least it wasn't a grudge Aziraphale was holding. Crowley ventured that the angel had reserved all energy an angel could pour into holding a serious grudge for unruly customers and people who tagged authors in mean-spirited reviews.  
好的。至少亚齐拉费尔没有怀恨在心。克劳利猜测，天使所保留的所有能量，都用来对付那些不守规矩的顾客和在恶意评论中标记作者的人。

Aziraphale did not bid him to sit down.  
亚齐拉费尔没有让他坐下。

"Listen, Crowley, I'd like to make this quick, as I have important business to attend."  
听着，克劳利，我想尽快解决这件事，因为我有重要的事务要处理。

"Oh?" "哦？"

With a heavy sigh the angel shook his head, wringing his hands.  
天使沉重地叹了口气，摇了摇头，握紧了双手。

"It's nothing of note, but I'd rather get it over with." He sighed again. "Oh, I'm sorry to be in such a mood over this and you. This has my feathers ruffled, I can tell you."  
这没什么值得注意的，但我宁愿把它解决掉。他又叹了口气。“哦，对不起，因为这件事和你我心情不好。我可以告诉你，这让我心烦意乱。”

"Apology accepted. And I still don't know what I supposedly did."  
道歉已接受。而且我仍然不知道我所谓的错误是什么。

"You pretty much ran off when I saw you at the market earlier. I thought it would have been nice to talk a little, we haven't spoken since we haven't seen each other for some weeks, what with my appointment to Denmark and all... Anyway. As I called out to you, you just ducked into the crowd and were gone."  
我在市场上看到你的时候，你差不多就跑掉了。我本以为能聊聊天会很好，毕竟我们已经好几个星期没见面了，还有我去丹麦的事情...不管怎样，当我喊你的时候，你就突然消失在人群中了。

Crowley blinked. 克劳利眨了眨眼睛。

Then he took off his sunglasses, and blinked again, this time with the intended effect.  
然后他摘下了墨镜，再次眨了眨眼睛，这次达到了预期的效果。

"What?" 什么？

"Don't '_What_' me, my dear boy. I know you well enough to pick you out of any crowd. A change of wardrobe won't change that."  
别跟我说“什么”，亲爱的孩子。我对你了解得足够多，无论在人群中我都能认出你。换个衣服并不能改变这一点。

"Change of..." Crowley shook his head in bafflement. "Aziraphale... What on Earth are you talking about? I haven't left my flat the whole day."  
“变化……”克劳利困惑地摇了摇头。“阿齐拉费尔，你到底在说什么？我整天都没离开过我的公寓。”

### Chapter Text 章节正文

~⧖~

Imagine, if you will, a seemingly endless hall of rows and rows and rows of towering filing cabinets. A soft bluish glow fills the place, the cabinets so high their upper drawers vanish into the shadows.  
请想象一下，一个看似无尽的走廊，里面摆满了一排又一排的高大文件柜。柜子散发着柔和的蓝色光芒，它们如此之高，上面的抽屉都消失在阴影中。

Imagine further, one of the drawers up in the shadows being opened in utmost silence and something being removed.  
进一步想象，阴影中的一个抽屉被无声地打开，然后有东西被取走。

If you think this spells Trouble, you are correct.  
如果你认为这会带来麻烦，那你是正确的。

~⧖~

To say Crowley was worried was quite an understatement. The whole affair with this _task_ was bad enough on its own. And Aziraphale's frazzlement wasn't helping.  
说克劳利担心简直是个轻描淡写。这项任务本身已经够糟糕的了，而阿齐拉费尔的困惑更是雪上加霜。

Oh, he _did_ reckon that the angel might have gotten his wings in a twist because he received his own set of orders from his side. Maybe. Crowley would not have been surprised. Not that he would have gotten any chance to tell Aziraphale about it.  
哦，他确实认为天使可能因为收到了自己那边的命令而感到困惑。也许吧。克劳利并不会感到惊讶。不过他也没有机会告诉亚齐拉费尔。

The angel had shooed him out of the shop - apologizing profusely- just after the revelation that Crowley had stayed in his flat the whole day.   
天使把他赶出了店铺，一边不停地道歉，就在得知克劳利整天都待在他的公寓里之后。

But the prospect of any order from Above throwing Aziraphale off so much he mistook a random stranger for Crowley...  
但是一旦来自上方的任何命令让亚齐拉费尔如此困惑，以至于他把一个陌生人误认为克劳利的可能性...

It did not make Crowley look forward to his own appointment. Not that he had been looking forward to it before.  
这并没有让克劳利期待自己的约会。虽然在此之前他也没有期待过。

Then again, all of this required, of course, that Aziraphale had indeed received a _task_ from Heaven. Crowley knew Aziraphale would have hinted that something was amiss. Just as Crowley had planned to do.  
然而，所有这一切都需要前提是，亚齐拉费尔确实从天堂接到了任务。克劳利知道亚齐拉费尔会暗示有些不对劲。就像克劳利计划要做的那样。

And as Aziraphale hadn't done anything in that regard, Crowley opted for option B:  
由于阿齐拉费尔没有采取任何行动，克劳利选择了B选项：

Aziraphale was doing something deeply embarrassing.\*  
亚齐拉费尔正在做一件非常尴尬的事情。

\*(Like a couple of weeks back when he had apparently insisted on a rather large package about to be handed to the shop next door being his, even had gotten the police involved, just for it to turn out to have been a delivery for the shop next door indeed. Crowley had only learned about it when the actual package was brought in by one of the folks from next door few days later.)  
就像几周前他坚持说一个即将交给隔壁店铺的大包裹是他的一样，甚至还找来了警察，结果证明那确实是隔壁店铺的快递。几天后，克劳利才从隔壁店铺的人那里得知了真正的包裹。

Crowley preferred to hold on to that thought. Imagining the angel's blabbering when he'd finally spill the beans about whatever wild goose chase he'd been on was certainly a much nicer thought than imagining what the _task_ that awaited Crowley now might be.  
克劳利更愿意坚持这个想法。想象天使终于说出他追逐的任何荒唐事情时的唠叨，肯定比想象现在等待着克劳利的任务是什么要好多了。

He checked his watch as he sauntered back into his flat. Whatever Hell had in store for him, they had exactly two more minutes to tell him where he's ought to go.  
他一边闲逛着走回公寓，一边看了看手表。无论地狱为他准备了什么，他们只剩下两分钟的时间告诉他他应该去哪里。

He frowned, and looked around. Something felt odd.  
他皱了皱眉头，四处张望。有些不对劲。

There was an odd demonic presence... present.  
有一个奇怪的恶魔存在...存在着。

They wouldn't go for an ambush, would they?  
他们不会选择伏击，对吧？

In his own home. 在他自己的家里。

Oh, who was he kidding? They would.  
哦，他在自欺欺人吗？他们会的。

But would they wait till the given time?  
但是他们会等到规定的时间吗？

No, no they wouldn't.  
不，不，他们不会的。

Crowley didn't relax. Not with that curious presence around. It felt far too familiar, but he couldn't pin down why.  
克劳利没有放松。因为那种好奇的存在在周围。它感觉太过熟悉，但他无法确定原因。

Concentrate, Crowley told himself. Had anything changed? Was anything off? He closed the door and edged forward.  
集中注意力，克劳利告诉自己。有什么变化吗？有什么不对劲的地方吗？他关上门，小心翼翼地向前走去。

The flat? Shiny. 这个公寓？闪亮。

Bed? Mostly Untouched. 床？大多数情况下都是未被触碰的。

Plants? Green and terrified.  
植物？绿色而恐惧。

Office? ... 办公室？...

Crowley stopped dead in front of the door.  
克劳利在门前突然停住了。

They wouldn't. 他们不会的。

They _couldn't_. 他们不能。

He nudged the door open with his foot nevertheless.  
他还是用脚轻轻推开了门。

And jumped back with an hysteric yelp when a bucket _did_ drop, spilling water all over the floor.  
当一个水桶掉下来，洒了一地的水时，他惊恐地尖叫着跳了回去。

"And where exactly should _I_ get bloody Holy Water from?" a voice called from the office, followed by a brief cackle. "Oh, y'should of seen yer face."  
“我到底从哪里弄那该死的圣水？”办公室里传来一个声音，紧接着是一阵短促的咯咯笑声。“哦，你们应该看到你们的表情。”

_Hastur_. 哈斯特尔。

"Do come in, Crowley. We gots places to be."  
请进，克劳利。我们得赶紧去一些地方。

Oh, this was just perfect, wasn't it?  
哦，这简直太完美了，不是吗？

Crowley got back up from having stumbled back and falling on his behind, dusted off his clothes and peeked into the office.  
克劳利从后退并摔倒在地上后重新站起来，拍了拍衣服，然后偷偷探视了一下办公室。

Hastur had made himself comfortable at the desk, feet up on it, hands folded in his lap.  
哈斯特尔舒服地坐在桌子旁，脚搁在桌上，双手交叉放在膝盖上。

Something about him looked odd, but Crowley didn't have the mind to concentrate on that now.  
他的样子有点奇怪，但克劳利现在没有心思去专注于那个。

"Do get your feet off my desk, will you?" Crowley mustered all the bravado he could in this situation, and entered the office, taking a wide step over the puddle.  
“把你的脚从我的桌子上拿开，好吗？”克劳利在这种情况下尽力展现出所有的勇气，走进了办公室，迈过了一滩水。

Absolutely involuntarily.   
完全是无意的。

Hastur smiled a humorless smile, rose...  
哈斯特微微一笑，没有一丝幽默，站了起来...

And Crowley found himself sprawled across his desk, one arm twisted onto his back, the senior demon's hand on his throat, sharp nails digging into his skin.  
克劳利发现自己横躺在办公桌上，一只手被扭到背后，高级恶魔的手掌压在他的喉咙上，锋利的指甲刺入他的皮肤。

"Jus' so we're clear," Hastur growled, "We're still far from done an’ over with. Not after what you did."  
“就这么说清楚了，”哈斯特咆哮道，“我们还远远没有结束。尤其是在你做了那件事之后。”

Crowley paled. 克劳利脸色苍白。

Demons, unlike angels, can pour near infinite energy into holding grudges. It came with the job.  
恶魔与天使不同，他们能够将无尽的能量投入到怀恨之中。这是他们的职责所在。

Hastur leaned forward, his mouth inches from Crowley's ear.  
哈斯特向前倾身，嘴巴离克劳利的耳朵只有几寸距离。

"I know what you did," he hissed, letting go of Crowley's neck and putting something onto the desk. Crowley looked. And almost laughed.  
“我知道你做了什么。”他嘶声道，松开了克劳利的脖子，然后把东西放在桌子上。克劳利看了一眼，差点笑出声来。

It was a rubber duck.  
那是一只橡皮鸭。

"Had some time to think o’ a thing or two," Hastur whispered.  
“有些时间思考了一两件事情。”哈斯特低声说道。

Crowley groaned, flailing his free arm haplessly at the senior demon. Bless it, he should have been more paranoid and careful.  
克劳利呻吟着，无助地挥舞着他的自由手臂，试图击退那位高级恶魔。真该死，他应该更加多疑和小心。

He expected the worst. 他预料到最糟糕的情况。

He certainly didn't expect Hastur to let go of him and stand back up.  
他肯定没想到哈斯特会放开他并重新站起来。

"Unfortunately the Master made it blessed clear he wants t’see you in one piece... preferably alive."  
很不幸，师傅明确表示他希望看到你完整无缺的出现...最好是活着的。

Crowley rolled over and stared up at Hastur.  
克劳利翻了个身，仰望着哈斯特尔。

Well, hadn’t he just been expecting the worst? Who’d have thought it’d be this bad?  
嗯，他本来就预料到最糟糕的情况了吧？谁能想到会这么糟糕呢？

There was something entirely displeased in Hastur's face, disappointed even. And it wasn't a 'I won't be allowed to finally make you pay' disappointment.  
哈斯特尔的脸上有一种完全不悦的表情，甚至有些失望。而这并不是一种“我终于可以让你付出代价”的失望。

Crowley wasn't certain if that was a good thing.  
克劳利不确定那是否是件好事。

"Bloody snake," Hastur murmured, and frowned. "Come now," he added with an air of finality, snapped his fingers, and with the sound off paper ripping the two demons were gone.  
“该死的蛇。”哈斯图尔嘟囔着，皱了皱眉。“来吧，”他带着决绝的口气补充道，弹了弹手指，伴随着纸撕裂的声音，两个恶魔消失了。

The demonic presence let out an exhausted sigh.  
恶魔的存在发出了一声疲惫的叹息。

~⧖~

It should be noted that what Aziraphale was up to wasn't in any way embarrassing. But he had been asked to keep this secret from Crowley. A '_Just in case'_ thing rather than anything... malicious.  
需要注意的是，阿齐拉费尔所做的事情并不令人尴尬。但他被要求对克劳利保守这个秘密。这只是一种“以防万一”的事情，而不是什么恶意。

He felt, all in all, more guilty about doing a little miracle to have his old computer run the program and so forth needed for what he was going to do. Therefore he vowed to buy an up-to-date computer once this was done and over with.  
总的来说，他对于为了完成自己即将要做的事情而进行一些小小的奇迹般的操作，让他的旧电脑能够运行所需的程序等等，感到更加内疚。因此，他发誓一旦这一切结束，就会购买一台最新的电脑。

If he didn't forget to do so, of course.  
如果他没有忘记的话，当然可以。

And only if it even became necessary.  
只有在必要的情况下才会发生。

Which he doubted. 他对此表示怀疑。

"Hello, Adam," he greeted as the video call connected.  
视频通话连接后，他打招呼道：“嗨，亚当。”

"Hi. Good you could make it," Adam greeted back and smiled.  
嗨，很高兴你能来，亚当回应并微笑着。

Aziraphale sighed. 亚齐拉费尔叹了口气。

"You... are looking well," he said politely, not knowing what else to do. He was really having a video call with The Antichrist. Whatever was the world coming to? And how does one start a casual chat with the Antichrist anyway?  
“你...看起来很好。”他客气地说道，不知道还能做什么。他真的正在与大魔王进行视频通话。这个世界到底怎么了？而且，要怎么和大魔王开始一场随意的聊天呢？

"Thanks, so do you," said Adam, dragging the angel from his thoughts. "I'll be quick. Promised Mum I'd help with them dishes. Any news from Heaven or Hell?"  
"谢谢，你也一样，"亚当说着，将天使从他的思绪中拉了出来。"我会快点的。答应妈妈帮忙洗碗。天堂或地狱有什么消息吗？"

Aziraphale shook his head. "Not yet. But I'd rather refrain from assuming they have nothing in store for us. Have there been any developments on your end?"  
亚齐拉费尔摇了摇头。“还没有。但我宁愿不去假设他们对我们没有任何计划。你那边有什么进展吗？”

Likewise, Adam shook his head. "Nope. Nothing new since that thing I told you about."  
同样，亚当摇了摇头。“嗯，自从我告诉你那件事以后，没有什么新的了。”

That... was concerning. 那个...让人担忧。

Adam had contacted Aziraphale a few days ago, and after about two hours worth of smalltalk, profound apologies and a bit of polite and awkward catching up, Adam had revealed that he had felt an odd ripple in reality that he couldn't make any sense of. And he had asked Aziraphale not to tell Crowley.  
亚当几天前联系了阿齐拉费尔，经过大约两个小时的闲聊、深刻的道歉和一些礼貌而尴尬的交流后，亚当透露他感觉到了现实中的一种奇怪波动，他无法理解。他请求阿齐拉费尔不要告诉克劳利。

They had figured that Crowley had enough to worry about after all that had happened - especially the things Adam had been unable to fix - so burdening him with this mystery wasn't a fair call at all.  
他们认为克劳利已经有足够的烦恼了，尤其是亚当无法解决的问题，所以让他承担这个谜团真的不公平。

Aziraphale had since been getting his wings in a twist trying to make sense of it all. He had hoped that Heaven might fill him in (as much as he dreaded their call), but so far he hadn't received any message.  
亚齐拉费尔一直在为此事而烦恼，他的翅膀也因此而纠结不已。他曾希望天堂能告诉他一切（尽管他对他们的呼叫感到恐惧），但到目前为止，他还没有收到任何消息。

"Anything from Mr. Crowley maybe?" asked Adam in a distinct 'last straw' tone.  
亚当以一种明显的“最后一根稻草”的语气问道：“克劳利先生有什么消息吗？”

"No. Oh, he had been here earlier, but you know him. Had there be any trouble he'd have said something."  
不，哦，他之前来过这里，但你知道他。如果有什么麻烦，他肯定会说的。

Adam nodded thoughtfully.  
亚当若有所思地点了点头。

"You'll keep an eye open?"  
你会留意吗？

"Of course." Aziraphale leaned back in his chair and glowered darkly.  
"当然了。"亚齐拉费尔靠在椅子上，阴沉地怒视着。

"What's wrong?" 怎么了？

"Mhn? Oh, it's nothing. It's just..." He told Adam about Crowley's odd behavior at the market. "He said it wasn't him, though. But I’ve known him for so long now." He frowned. "This isn't like him... Oh, I hope he's alright."  
"嗯？哦，没什么。只是..." 他向亚当讲述了克劳利在市场上的奇怪行为。"他说那不是他，但我和他认识这么久了。" 他皱了皱眉头。"这不像他的作风...哦，希望他没事。"

~⧖~

Crowley could not have been further from _alright_ if he and alright had been on opposite ends of the universe. Granted, maybe if he had been in pain and pieces, but those were really the only two factors. And Crowley had the sinking feeling they might sooner or later be added to the equation.  
克劳利离好得更远，就好像他和好处于宇宙的两端。当然，也许如果他感到痛苦和支离破碎，那可能是唯一的两个因素。克劳利有一种沉重的感觉，他们可能迟早会被加入到这个等式中。

Hastur dragged him along the corridors of Hell, and slowly but steadily Crowley got disoriented.  
哈斯特尔把他拖进地狱的走廊，克劳利渐渐失去了方向感，但却稳步前行。

That was one of the main issues with Hell. When they redecorated, they did it thoroughly. Other people rearranged furniture, Hell rearranged the entire everything.  
那是地狱的主要问题之一。当他们重新装修时，他们彻底地做到了。其他人只是重新摆放家具，而地狱则重新摆放了整个一切。

"Where are we going?" Crowley finally blurted out. Hastur stopped briefly and looked back at him.  
"我们要去哪里？" 克劳利终于脱口而出。哈斯特停下脚步，回过头看着他。

Huh, so that was what had struck Crowley as off. Hastur looked almost fully human.\*\*  
嗯，所以那就是让克劳利感到不对劲的原因。哈斯特看起来几乎完全像人类。

\*\*(Except for the eyes, but Crowley was about as far from being in any position to criticize that as he was from alright)  
（除了眼睛之外，但克劳利与批评眼睛的立场相距甚远，就像他与“好”的距离一样远）

Crowley was getting curious about it. The senior demon barely ever put effort and energy into a fully human-appearing form. Usually he did that only for longer jobs on Earth, or if he went out drinking or working on his Lust quota.  
克劳利对此感到好奇。这位资深恶魔几乎从不费力气去塑造一个完全类似人类的形态。通常情况下，他只会在地球上进行较长时间的工作，或者在外面喝酒或完成欲望任务时才这样做。

But never down here.  
但是永远不要在这里下去。

"Whatcha staring at?" Hastur snarled, and glared down at Crowley in a way that said 'I'll hurt you if you answer, and I'll hurt you if you don't, so spit it out'.  
“你盯着看什么？”哈斯特咆哮着，怒视着克劳利，眼神中透露出“如果你回答我，我会伤害你；如果你不回答，我也会伤害你，所以说出来”。

"Your..." said Crowley, gesturing. "You look much more human."  
克劳利挥手说道：“你看起来更像人类了。”

Hastur rolled his eyes and sneered, and yanked Crowley's arm to drag him deeper into the bowels of Hell.  
哈斯特翻了个白眼，嘲笑着，一把拉住克劳利的胳膊，将他拖入地狱的深处。

"Look what the cat dragged in."  
看看猫拖进来了什么。

Hastur froze as another demon stepped into the hallway. It took Crowley a moment to recognize who it was. Valefar, a Duke of Hell, and maybe the only denizen of Downstairs Hastur hated more than he hated Crowley.  
哈斯特尔在另一个恶魔走进走廊时停住了脚步。克劳利花了一会儿才认出他是谁。瓦勒法尔，地狱的公爵，也许是唯一一个哈斯特尔比克劳利更讨厌的地狱居民。

Valefar looked past Hastur, and grinned at Crowley, showing a lion-fang-lined grin. "Ah, there you are." He took a step forward, and patted Hastur's cheek. "And this time you even managed to run and fetch him. Without losing anyone. Good boy." He cackled.  
瓦勒法尔望过哈斯特尔，冲克劳利露出一丝露齿的笑容。“啊，你在这里啊。”他向前迈出一步，拍了拍哈斯特尔的脸颊。“这次你甚至成功地跑去找他了，而且没有丢失任何人。好孩子。”他发出一阵狂笑。

Crowley braced himself for Hastur lashing out at the other Duke. But it didn't happen.  
克劳利为哈斯特尔对另一位公爵的反击做好了准备。但是这并没有发生。

"Piss off, Valefar," Hastur snarled. "I got a delivery t'make."  
"滚开，瓦勒法尔，"哈斯图尔咆哮道。"我有个快递要送。"

"Oh, so I heard," said Valefar, "That's why I'm here indeed. I'll be taking the Serpent to our Master. And you, boy, can hurry along. You're not needed any longer."  
"哦，我听说了，"瓦勒法尔说道，"这就是我来的原因。我将把这条蛇带给我们的主人。至于你，小子，可以赶紧离开了。你已经不再需要了。"

Hastur snorted. And spat at the other Duke.  
哈斯特尔嗤笑了一声，然后向另一个公爵吐了口水。

"As if I'd fall for _that_. Piss off."  
就像我会上当一样。滚开。

Something ancient flashed behind Valefar's eyes.  
瓦勒法尔的眼中闪过一丝古老的东西。

It was a good thing that Crowley had braced himself already, so rolling back to his feet when Hastur pushed him to the side was child's play. When he looked back at the older demons they were already engaged in a full-blown fight.  
幸好克劳利已经做好了准备，所以当哈斯特将他推到一边时，他轻松地翻身站起来。当他回头看那些年长的恶魔时，他们已经陷入了一场激烈的战斗中。

Which was a major mistake on Valefar's part.  
这是Valefar犯下的一个重大错误。

They were both fast, vicious and dirty cheats, but Valefar wasn't a demon to ever go to Earth unless summoned.  
他们俩都是快速、凶残和卑鄙的骗子，但瓦勒法尔从不会主动去地球，除非被召唤。

Hastur meanwhile had the advantage of having engaged in pub fights on Earth since pubs existed.  
哈斯特尔与此同时拥有一个优势，那就是自从酒吧存在以来，他就一直参与地球上的酒吧斗殴。

Valefar was down and out in less than a minute, a nasty gash on his face.  
瓦勒法尔在不到一分钟的时间里被打得落花流水，脸上留下了一个可怕的伤口。

Hastur pocketed a straight razor with a practiced motion, and kneeled down next to his groaning opponent. "Good luck next time. You'll need it." He kicked Valefar in the ribs for good measure and stalked over to Crowley.  
哈斯特尔熟练地将一把剃刀收入口袋，然后跪在那个呻吟的对手旁边。“下次好运。你会需要的。”他为了确保，踢了一下瓦勒法尔的肋骨，然后朝着克劳利走去。

"Bloody time-wasting bastard," he murmured, and looked Crowley up and down. "And what yer waiting for? Come." A grin spread on Hastur's face. "Ah, an' before I forget it: Belphegor's awake."  
"他妈的浪费时间的混蛋，"他嘟囔着，审视着克劳利。"你还等什么？过来吧。"哈斯图尔的脸上露出了一丝笑容。"啊，还有，别忘了：贝尔菲戈已经醒了。"

_Oh._

_Shit_. 狗屎。

~⧖~

Aziraphale was pacing back and forth in the shop, trying to make sense of what Adam had told him so far, and of what he had experienced himself.  
亚齐拉费尔在店里来回踱步，试图理解亚当告诉他的事情，以及他自己所经历的一切。

There was a ripple in reality and a surge of energy that Adam said felt like his own.  
现实中出现了涟漪，一股能量涌动，亚当说感觉就像是自己的能量。

There was Crowley's odd and evasive behavior.  
克劳利的行为很奇怪而且含糊其辞。

There was of course the general situation on Earth.  
当然，地球上的整体情况是存在的。

There was the sheer fact they'd been, well, tricked back into service.  
他们被重新骗回工作岗位，这是一个不可否认的事实。

There was Gabriel standing a few feet away, looking smug as ever.  
那里站着加布里埃尔，离我几英尺远，一如既往地显得得意洋洋。

...

...

...

Aziraphale let out a yelp and fell backwards over a chair, muttering curses under his breath as he bumped his head against a shelf.  
亚齐拉费尔发出一声尖叫，向后倒在一把椅子上，嘴里咕哝着咒骂，头撞到了书架上。

"Language, Aziraphale," said the Archangel, all too pleased with himself, and Aziraphale scrambled to his feet. He huffed and dusted off his clothes.  
“语言，亚齐拉费尔，”大天使得意洋洋地说道，亚齐拉费尔急忙站起身来。他嘟囔了一声，拍了拍身上的灰尘。

"Oh, with all due respect, Gabriel, but you could have knocked. Or otherwise announced yourself. Common courtesy, you understand."  
哦，请恕我直言，加布里埃尔，你本可以敲门的。或者以其他方式宣布你的到来。这是常规的礼貌，你明白吧。

"You seemed too sunken in thoughts to notice anything," said Gabriel. "I assume you have a moment now? Certainly you do."  
"你似乎陷入了沉思，没有注意到任何事情，"加布里埃尔说道。"我猜你现在有时间了吧？当然你有。"

Aziraphale didn't even get to look bewildered before they were gone in a flash of light.  
亚齐拉费尔甚至来不及感到困惑，他们就在一道闪光中消失了。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

~⧖~

Hell was hardly what humans commonly imagined. At least on the whole. There were bits that fit common beliefs much more closely, like fiery pits and medieval torture chambers.  
地狱并不是人们通常所想象的那样。至少总体而言是这样的。有些地方更符合普遍的信仰，比如火焰熊熊的深渊和中世纪的刑罚室。

But that was less due to it being Hell, but due to these areas being the inner sanctu-... office of Satan himself. The inner offices of _all_ the seven Archdemons that made up the Dark Council reflected which one of the Deadly Sins they oversaw:  
但这并不是因为那是地狱，而是因为这些地方是撒旦本人的内部圣所... 七位构成黑暗议会的大恶魔的内部办公室反映了他们所监督的七宗罪中的哪一宗：

You had your lavish decorated dens of Lust with Asmodeus, the overwhelming hoards of material goods with Mammon, or soaked odds and ends that seemed stolen together from the other Archdemons with Leviathan.\*  
你曾经拥有过与阿斯莫德一起奢华装饰的欲望巢穴，与玛蒙一起拥有无尽的物质财富，或者与利维坦一起拥有那些看似从其他大恶魔那里偷来的零零碎碎的东西。

\*(Some demons familiar with human culture tended to make jokes about Leviathan trying to be 'Part of their World'. They all mysteriously drowned on dry ground.)  
（一些熟悉人类文化的恶魔喜欢拿利维坦试图成为“他们世界的一部分”开玩笑。他们全都神秘地在干地上淹死了。）

And then there was what someone had dubbed the 'Phantasmagoetia'\*\*  
然后就有了一个被某人称为“幻影术士”的东西

\*\* (Demons generally lacked imagination, until it came to physically painful puns)  
（恶魔通常缺乏想象力，直到涉及到身体上的痛苦双关语）

The dwelling of the Archdemon of Sloth, Belphegor, was an unsteady, ever-changing nightmarish (by Hell's standards by all means) amalgamation of... things. The best description of it for humans was probably that it had all the whimsical wrongness of an abandoned fun house, and then some.  
懒惰大魔王贝尔费戈的住所是一个不稳定、不断变化的噩梦般（按照地狱的标准来说）的混合物。对人类来说，最好的描述可能是它具有一个被遗弃的游乐场的怪异不正常感觉，甚至更甚。

Bosch and Bruegel would have called it weird.  
博世和布鲁盖尔会称之为奇怪的。

It was a bit of a Lost & Found for demons that didn't really fit anywhere else. Those that were too meek, too ineffective, too... odd in their ways, yet held too much potential for... something.  
这是一个对于那些不太适合其他地方的恶魔来说有点像是失物招领。那些过于温顺、无效、或者...行为怪异的恶魔，但又具备太多潜力，可以用于...某种目的。

But at the same time Belphegor was considered one of the most dangerous demons in the nine circles. She was quick-witted, had an entirely undemonic creativity and grasp on human technology -in fact, she was in charge of Hell's inventions-, was entirely unpredictable, and always seemed to know a little more than she should.  
但与此同时，贝尔菲戈尔也被认为是九层地狱中最危险的恶魔之一。她聪明机智，拥有完全不同于恶魔的创造力和对人类科技的理解 - 实际上，她负责地狱的发明创造 - 她完全不可预测，似乎总是知道比她应该知道的更多。

Only issue was that as Archdemon of Sloth she was quite a bit of a cloudcuckoolander with a tendency to sleep for extensive periods of time.  
唯一的问题是，作为懒惰的大魔王，她有点天马行空，经常喜欢长时间地睡觉。

But when she was awake...  
但是当她醒来的时候...

There were demons that caught themselves genuinely praying the moment news spread that Belphegor was up and about.  
当消息传开贝尔菲戈尔复活后，有些恶魔竟然真心地开始祈祷。

Crowley had all reasons to consider himself screwed.  
克劳利有充分的理由认为自己完蛋了。

Then again, Belphegor had taken a liking to him.  
然而，贝尔菲戈对他产生了好感。

Scratch that, he was probably _especially_ screwed since Belphegor had taken a liking to him.  
算了，他可能特别倒霉，因为贝尔菲戈对他有好感。

"They... redecorated..." said Crowley as Hastur dragged him down the narrow, sloping passage into Sloth's abode.  
“他们……重新装修了……”克劳利说着，哈斯特将他拖进了通往懒惰之神住所的狭窄而倾斜的通道。

Hastur simply harrumphed, and pushed Crowley down the corridor, "Get movin'."  
哈斯特只是哼了一声，然后把克劳利推到了走廊里，“赶紧走。”

Crowley looked around, immediately regretting the decision. He was a belphegorian demon himself, but he had never gotten used to the Phantasmagoetia.  
克劳利四处张望，立刻后悔起这个决定来。他自己也是一位贝尔菲戈尔恶魔，但他从未习惯过幻象魔法。

The general look and feel of the area wasn't the only thing that was not-wrong-but-not-exactly-right-even-by-Hell's-standards, as were the demons dwelling here. And they were watching him with growing interest.  
这个地区的整体外观和感觉不仅仅是不对，甚至连地狱的标准也无法完全符合，这里居住的恶魔也是如此。他们对他的注意力越来越浓厚。

"News spread fast in this corner o' Hell." Hastur grinned and ducked under a low archway, stepping into a large empty chamber.  
消息在这个地狱角落里传得飞快。哈斯图尔咧嘴一笑，躲过一座低矮的拱门，走进一个宽敞的空荡荡的大厅。

One of those hanging wicker chairs stood on the far end of the chamber, some sort of light filtering through an opening in the ceiling. Crowley had to give Belphegor credit for the illusion of a sky above.  
在室内的远端，有一把悬挂的柳条椅子，透过天花板上的一个开口，有一些光线透过来。克劳利必须承认贝尔菲戈尔在营造一个仿若天空的幻象方面做得很出色。

It was silent, only dust floating in the beams of light, until Hastur took a step forward, dragging Crowley with him, their steps echoing loudly in the empty room, startling some... pigeons -Crowley knew better than to take a closer look at them- into taking flight.  
只有灰尘在光束中飘动，一片寂静。直到哈斯特向前迈出一步，带着克劳利，他们的脚步在空荡的房间里回荡，惊动了一些鸽子——克劳利知道不要过于靠近它们——它们才惊飞起来。

Hastur straightened his posture as they reached the middle of the room, and the wicker chair began to turn. Crowley felt it before it happened. The air around them seemed to waver and distort, and with the sound of piano wire snapping the whole room changed.  
当他们走到房间中央时，哈斯特尔挺直了身子，藤椅开始转动。克劳利在事情发生之前就感觉到了。他们周围的空气似乎在扭曲和变形，伴随着钢琴弦断裂的声音，整个房间发生了变化。

Gone was the bleakness of Hell, replaced by... Crowley sighed heavily. They were standing in a twisted version of Eden, Tree and all.  
地狱的荒凉已经消失不见，取而代之的是……克劳利沉重地叹了口气。他们站在一个扭曲的伊甸园版本中，连树都在那里。

The chair stopped turning, and its inhabitant looked lazily at the two lower demons.  
椅子停止转动，坐在上面的人懒洋洋地看着两个下位恶魔。

Crowley would have given everything to take a nosedive into a tub full of Holy Water _now_ .  
克劳利现在愿意付出一切，跳进一缸圣水里。

~⧖~

At the same time, Aziraphale was sitting down in front of Gabriel's desk. This going to be a heart-to-heart.  
同时，亚齐拉费尔坐在加百列的办公桌前。这将是一次坦诚的交谈。

_Bother_ . 打扰。

"First things first, Aziraphale," said Gabriel sitting down and folding his hands, "We know what you did."  
首先，加百列坐下来，双手交叉，说道：“阿齐拉费尔，我们知道你做了什么。”

"Oh?" Well, that was bad.  
"哦？" 哎呀，那真糟糕。

Gabriel smiled and pushed a letter across the table. "The penultimate correspondence we held with Hell. Go ahead, read it."  
加布里埃尔微笑着将一封信推到桌子上。“这是我们与地狱最后一次通信。去吧，读一读。”

Well, _that_ was worse. 嗯，那真是糟糕透了。

Aziraphale took the writing gingerly, fumbled for his glasses and began reading.  
亚齐拉费尔小心地接过那篇文章，摸索着找到他的眼镜，然后开始阅读。

And was taken aback for a moment. The letter was a mess of crossed out lines, doodles and what looked like tea stains.  
一时间，他感到有些吃惊。这封信上到处都是划掉的线条、涂鸦和看起来像是茶渍的痕迹。

It read thus: 它的内容如下：

_To Ye Celest- \[crossed out\]  
致叶天星- \[划掉\]_

_Dear Hea- \[likewise crossed out\]  
亲爱的Hea- \[同样被划掉\]_

_To the Heavenly \[crossed out with wiggly lines\]  
至天堂_

_Hi_

_I am writing this letter ... I could type this up, couldn't I? I mean, you folks Up There have computers, right? Fax? If not, let me know. It'd be funny. Anyway... I'm writing this letter to inform you of what your field angelnt...  
我写这封信是为了告诉你们你们那边的事务代理...我可以打字，对吧？我是说，你们那边有电脑，对吗？传真机呢？如果没有的话，请告诉我。那会很有趣。无论如何...我写这封信是为了告知你们你们那边的事务代理..._

Aziraphale pinched the bridge of his nose at that, but continued reading.  
亚齐拉费尔听到那句话，捏了捏鼻梁，但还是继续阅读。

_... Aziraphale (was that his name? I think that was his name) ((Is it he? Does said angel take a male form and everything right now?)) and our field agent Crowley (I'd think you'll definitely have that names in your files, but if not for some reason, check for Crawly, Serpent of Eden, or Ke~...  
...阿齐拉费尔（是他的名字吗？我记得是他的名字）（他是吗？那个天使现在是男性形态吗？）和我们的外勤特工克劳利（我想你的档案中肯定有这些名字，但如果不是出于某种原因，请查找克劳利、伊甸园的蛇或者凯~..._

Aziraphale squinted, trying to read the rest. The handwriting here had dissolved... Virtually, into lazy scribbling, and, literally, where tea had drenched through the paper, taking the ink with it. He scanned the letter for the next readable bit.  
亚齐拉费尔皱起眉头，努力阅读剩下的内容。这里的字迹已经模糊不清……几乎变成了懒散的涂鸦，而且字迹还被茶水浸透了纸张，带走了墨水。他扫视着信件，寻找下一个可读的部分。

_...~at one, yes. Anyway, I heard that what happened after they twart \[crossed out\] thward \[likewise\] stopped Armageddon and I wondered how you have not had them face consequences for...  
...~对，就是这样。不管怎样，我听说在他们挫败了世界末日之后发生了什么，我想知道为什么你们没有让他们承担后果..._

Aziraphale paled. The rest of the paragraph detailed what he and Crowley had done down to a T.  
亚齐拉费尔脸色苍白。接下来的段落详细描述了他和克劳利所做的一切。

_...I thought I'd let you know. I mean, I told Satan already, and oh boy he's pissed... okay... Archdemon of Wrath and all, but I mean really \[underlined and circled\] pissed. But I think it's kinda funny and I love their creativity here, so I think each side should deal with their respective agent accordingly.  
...我想告诉你一声。我的意思是，我已经告诉了撒旦，哦天啊，他真的很生气...好吧...愤怒的大恶魔，我是说真的\[在下面划线并圈出\]非常生气。但我觉得这有点有趣，我喜欢他们在这里的创造力，所以我认为双方应该相应地处理他们各自的代理人。_

_I have an idea on the how, should you like to hear it.  
我有一个关于如何的想法，如果你愿意听的话。_

_RSVP.  请回复。_

_Yours falsely  你的虚伪_

_Belphegor, Archdemon of Sloth, The Disputer, Hell's Ambassador to France (Did I give Crowley credit for inventing french? I need to check that.)  
贝尔菲戈，懒惰的大恶魔，争论者，地狱驻法国大使（我是否给了克劳利发明法语的功劳？我需要检查一下。）_

"We do know that this account is truthful," said Gabriel, as Aziraphale pocketed his glasses with shaking hands. "And I must admit it's rather embarrassing that we didn't catch that little malicious miracle of yours earlier."  
“我们确实知道这个说法是真实的，”加百利说道，当阿齐拉费尔颤抖着将眼镜放进口袋时。“我必须承认，我们之前没有察觉到你那个小恶意奇迹，这真是有些尴尬。”

"Pardon?" 请再说一遍？

"The entire exploit of yours concerning those shapeshifting shenanigans were all showing up on your list of miracles. Though seeing you didn't catch on that we knew about it when Uriel mentioned your frivolous use of Heaven's resources either... I presume this little detail slipped everyone's minds." Gabriel smiled in a way that was both amused and one irritating event away from biting Aziraphale's head off. "So, Aziraphale. Is there anything you would like to tell us?"  
你那些变形把戏的全部表演都被列入了你的奇迹清单。尽管看起来你没有意识到我们知道这一点，当乌列尔提到你对天堂资源的轻率使用时...我猜这个小细节大家都忘记了。"加百列微笑着，既有趣又让人恼火，仿佛随时都要咬掉亚齐拉费尔的头。"那么，亚齐拉费尔，有什么你想告诉我们的吗？"

Aziraphale pressed his lips together.  
亚齐拉费尔紧紧咬住嘴唇。

"But before you answer," said Gabriel. "Remember that Heaven receiving that letter, getting confirmation from your files and arranging for further proceedings must be part of the..., ah, what was the term you used again... Ineffable Plan, don't you agree?"  
“在你回答之前，”加百列说道。“请记住，天堂收到那封信，从你的档案中得到确认，并安排进一步的程序，这都必须是那个……啊，你再说一遍那个术语是什么来着……难以言喻的计划的一部分，你同意吗？”

In that moment Aziraphale became dreadfully aware that no language known to Heaven, Hell or humans had a swear appropriate for how he felt.  
就在那一刻，亚齐拉费尔痛苦地意识到，天堂、地狱或人类所知的任何语言都无法表达他内心的愤怒。

"You..." Aziraphale began, not entirely certain where this was heading.  
“你……”亚齐拉费尔开始说道，对于这个对话的发展方向并不完全确定。

"I believe I don't have to remind you," Gabriel continued and got up, moving towards the window, "that technically speaking your punishment for thwarting the Apocalypse is still open."  
"我相信我不需要提醒你，"加百列继续说着站起身，走向窗户，"从技术上讲，你阻止了天启的惩罚仍然未决。"

The response was a gulp. Because, yes, technically... but then again... but also.  
回应是一口气。因为，是的，从技术上讲……但另一方面……同时也是。

"So, you and that demon will be given supervisors from here on," Gabriel interrupted Aziraphale's train of thought by dropping an entire herd of cows onto the track.  
“所以，从现在开始，你和那个恶魔将会被分配监督员。”加百列打断了亚齐拉费尔的思路，将一整群牛扔到了铁轨上。

"Pardon?" 请再说一遍？

"Supervisors, Aziraphale. Heaven and Hell have agreed that, all things considered, you are most suited as field agents. And that it won't do if you foil the Apocalypse again when the time comes. Thus..."  
主管们，阿齐拉费尔。天堂和地狱一致认为，考虑到一切，你们最适合担任外勤特工。而且，当末日来临时，如果你们再次阻止了天启，那是不行的。因此...

Aziraphale hung his head. "I understand."  
亚齐拉费尔低下了头。“我明白。”

"Good." 好的。

"Ehm... This supervisor..."  
嗯... 这个主管...

"Yes?" "是吗？"

"Who are they?" 他们是谁？

"A," Gabriel rubbed his chin as if looking for the right word, "recent arrival. But very eager to play a part in this. You see, it's all working out surprisingly well."  
“啊，”加布里埃尔摩挲着下巴，仿佛在寻找合适的词语，“最近才来的。但非常渴望在这里扮演一定角色。你看，一切都进展得出奇地顺利。”

Aziraphale sighed... and invented a suitable swear under his breath.  
亚齐拉费尔叹了口气...并在心里发明了一个合适的咒骂词。

~⧖~

"Crowley," Belphegor slurred, eyeing him with amusement, "It's been a while, hasn't it? When was the last time we saw each other?"  
“克劳利，”贝尔菲戈含糊地说着，眼神中带着一丝娱乐，“我们已经有一段时间没见了，对吧？上次我们见面是什么时候来着？”

"Emm, thirteenth century, I think, before you went and took a nap," said Crowley, and suddenly made a face as if he had a major epiphany.  
“嗯，十三世纪吧，我想，在你去打个盹之前。”克劳利说着，突然露出一副恍然大悟的表情。

"Yes, I remember. I think we kind of missed each other in the nineteenth century. But I know what you did since then."  
是的，我记得。我觉得我们在19世纪有点错过了彼此。但是我知道你从那时起做了什么。

Belphegor sat up, stretched, and looked at Hastur expectantly.  
贝尔菲戈坐起身来，伸了个懒腰，期待地看着哈斯特尔。

Hastur cleared his throat. "'S Belphegor wot told Hell whatcha got up to. Woke up, took a gander at things an' went 'Yeah, them two swapped bodies an' shite, 'ow didn't y'notice?'." Hastur made a dismissive gesture. "As if it weren't no big deal."  
哈斯特清了清嗓子。"贝尔菲戈告诉地狱你干了什么。醒来后，看了看情况，说'是啊，他们俩换了身体，怎么没注意到呢？'"哈斯特不屑地挥了挥手。"好像没什么大不了的样子。"

"It wasn't," said Belphegor and rose from her seat, wandering over to the two lower demons and going tiptoes to look Hastur in the eyes. "Kudos to Legion, though. He noticed it straight-away. I only confirmed things. And it's really weird how you other people couldn't tell." She bounced on her toes a little and looked at Crowley. "I'd have just cut your head off and dealt with what came out. Quickest way t'go 'bout things." She smiled, kaleidoscope-like eyes shining. "So, ten points to Phantasmagoetia for fantastic flabbergasting flapdoodlery."  
“不是这样的，”贝尔菲戈尔说着从座位上站起来，走到两个较低级的恶魔面前，踮起脚尖与哈斯特对视。“虽然冥冥之中感觉到了，但是要感谢冥冥之中。我只是确认了一下。真奇怪，你们其他人怎么就没发觉呢。”她稍微跳了跳脚尖，看着克劳利。“我本来会直接砍掉你的脑袋，然后处理出来的东西。这是最快的方式。”她微笑着，眼睛闪烁着万花筒般的光芒。“所以，给幻影魔法学院加十分，因为他们的惊人的胡言乱语真是令人震惊。”

Crowley looked bewildered and worried. Hastur looked as if he could do with a drink or three.  
克劳利看起来困惑而担忧。哈斯特看起来好像需要喝上三杯酒。

"You know, Crowley," said Belphegor, picking an apple from the Tree (it was blue), "I think the whole 'punishment fitting the crime' is nonsense. That ironic stuff is something She can do very well without some jealous, wrathful full-of-themselves Archangels throwing hissy-fits and some pseudo-diplomacy." Belphegor took a great bite out of the discoloured fruit and gazed into the distance.  
“你知道吗，克劳利，”贝尔菲戈说着，从树上摘下一个苹果（它是蓝色的），“我觉得整个‘罪有应得’的惩罚是胡扯。那种讽刺的东西，她完全可以自己搞定，不需要一些嫉妒、愤怒、自以为是的大天使们发脾气，还有一些伪外交。”贝尔菲戈大口咬下那个变色的水果，凝视着远方。

Crowley shifted his weight from foot to foot.  
克劳利不停地在脚上转移重心。

And after another five minutes dared to clear his throat. Belphegor looked at him as if she had forgotten he was there. Which she probably had.🔄  ❓

"Ah, 'bout the whole punishment thing," said Hastur as helpfully as he was capable of.  
“啊，关于整个惩罚的事情，”哈斯特尔回答得尽可能有帮助。

"Oh, yes," said Belphegor, plugging the apple back onto the Tree. "Now, we -the Council that is, after Asmodeus returned from America and Leviathan could be arsed to come to the surface- talked about things. And we found something much better than irony."  
“哦，是的。”贝尔菲戈尔说着，将苹果重新插回树上。“现在，我们——即议会，在阿斯莫德斯从美国回来，利维坦愿意浮出水面之后——讨论了一些事情。我们发现了比讽刺更好的东西。”

Belphegor smiled brilliantly, and Crowley stiffened.  
贝尔菲戈尔灿烂地笑了起来，而克劳利僵硬了起来。

"The Council wants you to retrieve a file from The Archives," she said.  
她说：“委员会希望你从档案馆取回一个文件。”

Crowley's posture slumped in surprise and he blinked at the Archdemon. "What... I mean... What, Mistress?"  
克劳利惊讶地垂下了肩膀，眨了眨眼睛看着大恶魔。“什么……我的意思是……什么，女主人？”

Next to him, Hastur shared his bafflement.  
在他旁边，哈斯图尔也感到困惑。

Belphegor shrugged and handed Crowley a slip of parchment.  
贝尔菲戈耸了耸肩，递给克劳利一张羊皮纸条。

It was empty. 它是空的。

Crowley looked at Hastur, who still seemed as clueless, and then back at Belphegor.  
克劳利看着哈斯特尔，他仍然一脸茫然，然后又看向贝尔菲戈。

For a moment he wondered if the Archdemon didn't mix him up with another demon all of a sudden. As Archdemon of Sloth Belphegor was quite prone to being a little scatterbrained.  
有一瞬间，他想知道是否大恶魔突然把他和另一个恶魔搞混了。作为懒惰大恶魔的贝尔菲戈尔相当容易健忘。

Then again, it were the archives. And those were everything one could expect in Hell. And worse, since people down here had taken some cues from humans. Still, he couldn't see how that was _suitable_ punishment. He wondered what the catch was.  
再说，那就是档案馆。而那些就是地狱里所有人能期待的一切。更糟糕的是，因为这里的人们从人类那里学到了一些东西。不过，他无法看出这是怎样一种合适的惩罚。他想知道其中的问题在哪里。

Crowley looked down at the parchment again, just as fiery lines began to appear.  
克劳利再次低头看着羊皮纸，就在此时，火红的线条开始浮现出来。

"That's the file we want you to retrieve," said Belphegor.  
“那就是我们希望你找回的文件。”贝尔菲戈说道。

The lines had completed themselves and it took Crowley a moment to recognize the message.  
那些线条已经完成了，克劳利花了一会儿才认出了信息。

Immediately he dropped the parchment as if it were a holy relic. Turned out the catch was a bit of a pitfall with sticky spikes at the bottom.  
他立刻将羊皮纸放下，仿佛它是一件神圣的遗物。结果发现那个陷阱是一个带有粘性尖刺的陷阱。

"Mistress," Crowley blubbered, "I..."  
“女士，”克劳利哽咽着说道，“我……”

Belphegor smiled from ear to ear. "What's wrong, Crowley? Is a small, simple trip to The Archives asking too much?"  
贝尔菲戈尔笑得合不拢嘴。“怎么了，克劳利？去档案馆这么简单的小旅行有什么问题吗？”

Crowley let out a heavy sigh and picked up the note again. "No, Mistress." He looked gloomily at the writing. It was a file-code, alright. Just not one of Hell's.  
克劳利沉重地叹了口气，再次拿起那张纸条。“不，女士。”他沮丧地看着上面的字迹。没错，这是一个文件代码。只是不是地狱的代码而已。

Hastur leaned over as inconspicuously as his build allowed, and grinned satisfied.  
哈斯特尽可能不引人注意地俯身过去，满意地露出了笑容。

"Good luck, pal. Really doubt ye'll be allowed Upstairs for that now. Or in any case. Have a happy demise."  
祝你好运，伙计。真怀疑你现在能不能被允许上楼。或者无论如何都不行。祝你有一个愉快的离世。

"We expect this done immediately," interrupted Belphegor. "So you two best hurry along."  
“我们希望立即完成这件事情。”贝尔菲戈打断道。“所以你们两个最好赶快去做。”

Hastur's smile faltered, while Crowley's head shot up.  
哈斯特的微笑变得有些迟疑，而克劳利的头抬了起来。

"What?" they croaked in unison.  
"什么？" 他们异口同声地嘶哑着。

"Why am I... This is about Crowley and what he did with Ligur,"  Hastur seethed. "And stoppin' Armageddon and all!..." He drew a sharp breath as he remembered who he was talking to. "Mistress," he added quickly.  
“为什么我会……这是关于克劳利和他与利古尔的事情，”哈斯特咆哮道。“还有阻止世界末日和一切！……”他深吸了一口气，想起自己正在和谁说话。“女士，”他迅速补充道。

"Yes," Belphegor smiled amused. "And about _you_ failing to stop him."  
“是的，”贝尔菲戈笑着，带着一丝嘲弄。“还有关于你未能阻止他的事情。”

"...oh." "...哦。"

Crowley had never seen Hastur look so defeated.  
克劳利从未见过哈斯特尔如此失意。

"I..." Crowley ventured, clinging to a straw, "... assume, going by what you said, the whole diplomatic approach and such is off?"  
“我……”克劳利冒险地说道，抓住一根稻草，“……根据你所说的，我可以假设外交途径和类似的方式都不再适用了？”

Belphegor looked at him blankly, and then nodded to Hastur to answer.  
贝尔菲戈茫然地看着他，然后点头示意哈斯特尔回答。

"Ya," he grumbled. "An' after what you an' yer angel pulled, Up There an' Down Here've upped security measures'n shite. Setting foot into Heaven now kills a demon faster than..." Hastur choked back the comparison, and Crowley knew which he had been going for. Even if he hadn't guessed, the glare Hastur then gave him would have told him. "Just like gettin' down'ere now makes an angel fall even faster if they don't burn first."  
"呀，"他抱怨道。"在你和你的天使搞的那些事之后，上面和下面都加强了安全措施。现在踏入天堂比..."哈斯特压住了比喻的话，克劳利知道他想说什么。即使他没有猜到，哈斯特那时给他的怒视也能告诉他。"就像现在下到这里，天使如果不先烧起来，就会更快地坠落。"

"So, you're sending us Upstairs to... just die painfully?"  
"那么，你们要把我们送上楼去……就这样痛苦地死去吗？"

Belphegor shook her head at Crowley. "We want you to retrieve that file. It's very important."  
贝尔菲戈尔对克劳利摇了摇头。“我们希望你能找回那个文件。它非常重要。”

Crowley drew a sharp breath. But, without moving to cross the distance between them, Belphegor came face to face with him, pressing something into his hand.  
克劳利倒抽了一口气。但是，贝尔菲戈并没有移动去拉近他们之间的距离，而是与他面对面，将某物塞进了他的手中。

Crowley looked down. It was a bracelet. It looked a little like a smartwatch in the shape of an hourglass.  
克劳利低头看了看。那是一只手链。它有点像一个沙漏形状的智能手表。

Belphegor flounced over to Hastur, giving him an identical bracelet, and what looked like a keycard.  
贝尔菲戈大摇大摆地走向哈斯特尔，递给他一条完全相同的手链，以及一张看起来像是门禁卡的东西。

"The card is for the disused express elevator," Belphegor explained. "The thingamabobs will give you one hour of protection from all the blessedness Up There and hide you from their surveillance." She whacked her finger at them. "One hour, once activated. Understood?"  
"这张卡是给废弃的快速电梯用的，"贝尔菲戈解释道。"这些小玩意儿会让你在上面的一切祝福中获得一小时的保护，并且隐藏你免受他们的监视。"她用手指戳了戳它们。"一小时，一旦激活。明白了吗？"

Crowley looked at Hastur, who begrudgingly put the bracelet on.  
克劳利看着哈斯特，哈斯特勉强地戴上了手镯。

"Yes..." he said, and Hastur just grunted in agreement.  
"是的..." 他说道，而哈斯特只是咕哝着表示同意。

"Splendid." Belphegor clapped her hands. "Now. Orias has prepared suitable clothes for you. Off you go."  
"太棒了。"贝尔菲戈鼓掌道。"现在，奥利亚斯已经为你准备了合适的衣服。赶快去吧。"

~⧖~

Entirely elsewhere, yet not too far away, there was a meeting.  
在完全不同的地方，但又不太远的地方，有一次会议。

"So what do you think?" said the first figure, huddling into the corner of the abandoned room they were in.  
“那么你觉得呢？”第一个人影问道，他们挤在他们所在的废弃房间的角落里。

"We're either extremely lucky," said the other, smaller figure, "or extremely screwed."  
另一个身材较小的人说道：“要么我们非常幸运，要么我们非常倒霉。”

"By what standards?" 按照什么标准？

The second figure pondered. "The local ones, I'd say."  
第二个人思考了一下。“我会选择当地的。”

The first figure crossed their arms and nodded wistfully. "I can live with those."  
第一个人双臂交叉，略带遗憾地点了点头。“我可以接受这些。”

~⧖~

White was not Crowley's colour. Especially not white and cream. He had to give Orias and his underlings credit though: They had manufactured a sleek, snazzy suit that might as well have been nicked from Heaven directly. Orias had even managed to make Hastur look good.  
白色不是克劳利的颜色，尤其是白色和奶油色。不过他不得不承认奥利亚斯和他的手下们的功劳：他们制造了一套时尚、漂亮的西装，几乎可以说是直接从天堂偷来的。奥利亚斯甚至成功地让哈斯特尔看起来很帅气。

Even though Crowley wasn't certain what exactly to make of a celestial mobster outfit.  
尽管克劳利对于一个天界黑帮装束到底是什么意思并不确定。

Hastur meanwhile swiped the card through a reader in the elevator, pocketed it as the doors closed and put on a pair of sunglasses.  
同时，哈斯特尔在电梯里刷了一下卡，等门关闭后将卡放入口袋，并戴上了一副太阳镜。

"We look like complete wankers," he said, eyeing their reflection in the mirrored doors. Then he grinned. "Gonna blend in perfectly."  
“我们看起来像是一群彻头彻尾的白痴。”他眼睛盯着镜子门中的倒影说道。然后他咧嘴一笑。“完美地融入进去。”

"We're... really going to do this?" Crowley dared to ask, adjusting his own glasses.  
"我们...真的要这么做吗？" 克劳利不敢相信地问道，调整了一下自己的眼镜。

"Seems so, dunnit?" Hastur stared into space for a moment, before elbowing Crowley into the stomach.  
"是这样的，是吧？" 哈斯图尔盯着虚空片刻，然后用手肘顶了克劳利一下肚子。

"What was that for now?" Crowley coughed once he found his breath again.  
克劳利喘过气来后咳嗽着问道："这是为了什么？"

"Needed that." 需要的。

That was good enough an answer. Crowley brought as much of a distance between himself and Hastur as currently possible, eyeing the senior demon more warily than ever before.  
那个回答已经足够好了。克劳利尽可能地与哈斯特尔保持距离，比以往更加警惕地盯着这位资深恶魔。

He had never seen Hastur as tense as now. Or better, not this kind of tense. Hastur was usually wound up to the point of snapping, but something seemed different. Crowley couldn't name it. It wasn't the usual annoyance, and it wasn't any form of worry about this kamikaze mission either.  
他从未见过哈斯特如此紧张。或者更准确地说，不是这种紧张。哈斯特通常紧绷到快要崩溃的地步，但现在似乎有些不同。克劳利无法形容这种感觉。这不是他平常的烦恼，也不是对这次特殊任务的担忧。

Still Crowley couldn't name it. He just wished he could talk to Aziraphale right now.  
克劳利仍然无法给它取个名字。他只希望现在能和阿齐拉费尔交谈。

"One hour," Hastur suddenly said, as the elevator slowed down. "Count of three," he reached for the bracelet. Crowley scrambled to do the same. "One. Two. Three."  
“一个小时。”哈斯特突然说道，电梯减速下降。“数到三。”他伸手去拿手镯。克劳利急忙跟着做同样的动作。“一，二，三。”

With a menacingly cheerful chime the door opened, and even with his sunglasses Crowley had to squint a little at the bright light, taking in the scene.  
门发出一声威胁性的欢快铃声打开了，即使戴着墨镜，克劳利还是不得不眯起眼睛，看着明亮的光线，观察着场景。

Well, wasn't that just splendid? Heaven had redecorated, too.  
哇，这真是太棒了！天堂也重新装饰了呢。

~⧖~

"This might become an issue," said the older one, watching the cars go by.  
年长的那个人看着车流，说道："这可能会成为一个问题。"

The younger one shrugged, throwing an empty plastic cup over their shoulder into the shrubbery. "'S maybe what we need?" they asked almost hopefully. "You got a ride?"  
年轻的那个耸了耸肩，将一个空的塑料杯扔到了身后的灌木丛中。"也许这就是我们需要的？" 他们几乎带着一丝希望地问道。"你有车吗？"

The older one considered, and looked down at a torn newspaper page reporting on a recent measles outbreak. "And all that due to digital rubbish. You can be proud of yourself, kid," they added, and the younger one smiled a smile that reminded a little of dried battery acid.  
年长的那个人考虑了一下，低头看着一张报道最近麻疹爆发的破旧报纸页面。“这都是因为那些数字垃圾。你可以为自己感到骄傲，孩子，”他们补充道，而年轻的那个人微笑着，那微笑有点像干掉的电池酸。

~⧖~

Aziraphale was dithering, to say the least. Sure, getting a supervisor was better than total personal annihilation. In theory. But if Heaven had agreed to a suggestion like that from _Hell_ ... there had to be a catch.  
阿齐拉费尔犹豫不决，至少可以这么说。当然，找个主管比完全个人毁灭要好。理论上是这样。但是如果天堂同意了来自地狱的建议……肯定有陷阱。

At least he had been given a moment to wander the new lush inner courtyard (Aziraphale had to admit, he liked the greenery and the fountain they put up there) to clear his mind before meeting that new supervisor.  
至少他被给予了一段时间在新的郁郁葱葱的内庭院里漫步（阿齐拉费尔不得不承认，他喜欢那里的绿意和他们建造的喷泉），以便在见到新主管之前清理思绪。

Then again, Aziraphale suspected that this was meant to keep him on edge. They knew he'd come up with some unpleasant scenarios on what to expect. How bad could it be, he mused.  
然而，阿齐拉费尔怀疑这是为了让他保持警惕。他们知道他会想出一些不愉快的情景来预料。他在心里琢磨着，会有多糟糕呢。

The most plausible scenario was that this was meant to drive a wedge between him and Crowley. If they'd constantly have someone watching their every move from now on...  
最有可能的情况是这是为了在他和克劳利之间制造隔阂。如果从现在开始他们会一直有人监视他们的一举一动的话...

Aziraphale shook his head. What should he do? Could he do?  
亚齐拉费尔摇了摇头。他应该做什么？他能做什么？

"G'morning, dear," he greeted as Crowley walked by.  
“早上好，亲爱的。”他在克劳利经过时打招呼。

"G'morning, angel," Crowley greeted back.  
早上好，天使，克劳利回应道。

Then they both froze.  
然后他们俩都呆住了。

Aziraphale spun on his heels and pulled Crowley into the shadow of one of the concrete columns lining the courtyard.  
亚齐拉费尔转身，迅速将克劳利拉入庭院边的混凝土柱子的阴影中。

"Crowley, what are you doing sneaking around in Heaven?... How did you even get in here?" he hissed with growing despair. "You are a _demon_ !"  
克劳利，你在天堂里悄悄溜达什么？...你是怎么进来的？"他嘶声力竭地说道，绝望之情渐渐蔓延开来。“你是个恶魔！”

"And the Patron Saint of Manchester, thank you very much."🔄  ❓

Aziraphale gave him a long, cool look. "No really, what on Earth are you doing here? How? Heaven and Hell upped their security measures after they found out about our little exploit. Kills demons faster than Holy Water..."  
亚齐拉费尔冷冷地盯着他看了一会儿。“真的，你到底在这里做什么？怎么会？天堂和地狱在得知我们的小把戏后加强了安全措施。比圣水还能快速杀死恶魔…”

"And gets angels to Fall or burn even faster, I heard, I heard." Crowley groaned softly, hazarded a glance around and revealed Belphegor's device. "This gives me about an hour up here. Aziraphale, please, they want me to get a file from your Archives. Just point me there and..."  
“听说，听说他甚至能让天使们更快地堕落或燃烧。”克劳利轻声抱怨着，环顾四周，然后展示了贝尔菲戈的装置。“这个能让我在这里多待一个小时。亚齐拉费尔，请告诉我你的档案馆在哪里，他们要我从那里取一个文件，只要指给我方向就行…”

Aziraphale bristled a little. "Crowley, I can't allow that, no matter what. Especially not with the new supervisor around."  
亚齐拉费尔有些不悦地皱了皱眉。“克劳利，无论如何我不能允许那样做。尤其是在新主管到来之后。”

"Supervisor?" "主管？"

"Guess Hell didn't go through with their end of that plan then." Aziraphale wrung his hands. "Listen, as I just said, Heaven knows what we did."  
“看来地狱没有按照他们的计划去做。”亚齐拉费尔焦虑地揉着双手。“听着，就像我刚才说的，天堂知道我们做了什么。”

"So does Hell." 地狱也是如此。

"I'm aware. Guess who told Heaven."  
我知道。猜猜是谁告诉了天堂。

Crowley groaned. 克劳利呻吟了一声。

"Crowley, listen," Aziraphale pleaded, casting a nervous look around. Thankfully there were few other angels in the courtyard (most of them were on the galleries surrounding it). "Hell contacted Heaven not too long ago and..."  
克劳利，听我说，"亚齐拉费尔恳求道，他紧张地四处张望。幸运的是，庭院里几乎没有其他天使（大部分都在周围的走廊上）。"地狱不久前联系了天堂，而且..."

Crowley peeked over the rim of his glasses. "Angel. I have a bit more than half an hour left. Short version, please."  
克劳利从眼镜边缘偷偷瞥了一眼。“天使，我只剩下半个多小时了。请简短地告诉我。”

Aziraphale gave him the short version.  
亚齐拉费尔给了他简短的版本。

"Tsk," Crowley went, "Aren't we a little old for a nanny? Anyway, angel. Archives."  
“啧啧，”克劳利说道，“我们不是有点儿大了，还需要保姆吗？不管怎样，天使，档案室。”

"I can't just point you to Heaven's Archives, Crowley."  
"克劳利，我不能简单地告诉你天堂档案的位置。"

"They want me to retrieve a file."  
他们希望我去取回一个文件。

"'Steal' you mean." "你是说'偷'吗。"

"They can hardly go and just asked for it, now that they cut of all the diplomatic approaches, right?"  
现在他们已经切断了所有的外交途径，所以他们几乎不可能去请求了，对吧？

Aziraphale grumbled. 亚齐拉费尔嘟囔着。

"I look away fer a second, and y'go rattin' us out?" came a snarl from the shadows, and Crowley made an odd sound as Hastur stepped up behind him.  
“我才一转身，你就把我们出卖了？”阴影中传来一声咆哮，哈斯特从克劳利身后走了上来，克劳利发出了一声奇怪的声音。

"Wot, not gonna introduce us?" said Hastur, glaring at both of them (but mostly Aziraphale) over his glasses. "Haven't met officially, 'ave we?"  
“喂，不打算给我们介绍一下吗？”哈斯特咆哮着盯着他们两个（但主要是阿齐拉费尔）的眼镜上。“我们还没有正式见过面，对吧？”

Aziraphale shuffled a little and nervously.  
亚齐拉费尔有些不安地踱步着。

"Look, I wanna survive the next night. Got that, Principality?" said Hastur, crossing his arms. Aziraphale didn't miss the surprise on Crowley's face, but he couldn't sort it. He had an inkling, however, that Crowley was surprised at the senior demon being so... civil.  
“看着，我想活过下一个晚上。明白了吗，亲王？”哈斯特说着，双臂交叉。阿齐拉费尔注意到了克劳利脸上的惊讶，但他无法理清其中的原因。不过，他有点感觉到克劳利对于这位高级恶魔如此…礼貌感到惊讶。

Then again, they were in Heaven, they were on a time limit and... Aziraphale made a distressed sound.  
然而，他们又回到了天堂，他们有时间限制，而……亚齐拉费尔发出了一声苦恼的声音。

"What file do you need?" he said, after looking around again, hoping for the best.  
他环顾四周，再次抱着最好的希望说道："你需要哪个文件？"

Crowley fished a slip of paper from his pocket. "It's a pretty old one, innit?"  
克劳利从口袋里掏出一张纸条。“这是一张相当古老的纸条，不是吗？”

Aziraphale read the note. And nodded. "That's pre-edenic even."  
亚齐拉费尔读了便条，点了点头。“这甚至是伊甸园前的语言。”

"Hah, y'owe me one, Crowley." Hastur grinned.  
哈哈，克劳利，你欠我一个人情。哈斯特笑着说道。

"Look," said Aziraphale, handing the note back, "I'll pretend I didn't see you..."  
“看着吧，”阿齐拉费尔递回纸条，“我会假装没看见你的…”

"Pretend you gave directions to newly-fangled angels," Crowley grinned, flicking a forked tongue at Aziraphale.  
“假装你给新潮的天使们指路。”克劳利咧嘴一笑，对着阿齐拉费尔吐了个叉状的舌头。

"Oh stop that. For this one, you owe me quite a bit, dear. Up three floors, and than straight that way till you're there. Now hurry."  
哦，别再说了。亲爱的，这一次你欠我不少呢。上三层，然后一直往那边走，就到了。现在快点。

"You're an angel, angel."  
你是个天使，天使。

"Shoosh." "嘘。"

Aziraphale wrinkled his nose as Hastur swept a mocking bow before he pulled Crowley along. Then he wrung his hands, hoping that he'd done the right thing.  
亚齐拉费尔皱了皱鼻子，哈斯特尔嘲弄地鞠了一躬，然后拉着克劳利走开。然后他握紧双手，希望自己做对了。

It had to be, he concluded. A file that old... Hell was more than likely just trying to either get Crowley killed or at least very miserable. Can't have that, can we?  
他得出结论，这是必然的。那么老的文件...地狱很有可能只是想要让克劳利丧命，或者至少让他非常痛苦。我们可不能容忍这种事发生，对吧？

The only thing that worried him was Hastur's presence. Why would they...  
唯一让他担心的是哈斯图尔的存在。为什么他们会...

"Aziraphale?" someone called, and Aziraphale jumped in surprise. He turned, looking at the other angel.  
“亚齐拉费尔？”有人喊道，亚齐拉费尔吓了一跳。他转过身，看着另一个天使。

"Yes. Can I help... oh."  
可以。我能帮忙...哦。

The other made a thoroughly unimpressed face. "Y've been told 'bout that whole supervisor thing? That'd be me."  
另一个人露出了一副完全不以为然的表情。“你听说过那个主管的事情吗？那就是我。”

"Oh. Oh my." Aziraphale blinked. He had expected a lot of things, but seeing this angel before him was absolutely baffling.  
哦。哦天哪。亚齐拉费尔眨了眨眼。他预料到了很多事情，但是看到眼前的这个天使实在是令人困惑。

And the chameleon perched on his shoulder certainly wasn't helping.  
而且，栖息在他肩膀上的变色龙确实没有起到任何帮助。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

~⧖~

Crowley was snaking his way through the present crowd, always ducking out of sight the moment he felt someone's eyes on him.\* Hastur, meanwhile, was stalking ahead, looking like...  
克劳利正在人群中蜿蜒穿行，每当感觉到有人盯着他时，他总是迅速躲开视线。与此同时，哈斯特则在前方潜行，看起来像...

Angel of the Apocalypse was definitely not appropriate, but he was definitely in a bad mood.  
末日天使绝对不合适，但他肯定心情糟糕。

As usual. 照常。

\*Which was quite a bit of work, as not all angels were wandering around in a human shape.  
这是相当费力的工作，因为并不是所有的天使都以人类的形态游荡。

But still something about it struck Crowley as off. Hastur was a nasty, bitter and humorless piece of work, but there was a bitterness in his demeanor now that was... off. If Crowley hadn’t known Hastur wasn't capable of either, he'd have called it wistfulness and regret.  
但是克劳利仍然觉得其中有些不对劲。哈斯特尔是个讨厌、刻薄且毫无幽默感的家伙，但他现在的态度中有一种...不对劲的苦涩。如果克劳利不知道哈斯特尔既不具备这两种情感，他会说那是一种留恋和后悔。

And demons had no use for regret to begin with. Crowley knew best.  
而恶魔本来就不需要后悔。克劳利最清楚不过了。

At least making their way to the Archives gave him some time to study Hastur closer.  
至少前往档案馆给了他一些时间更仔细地研究哈斯特尔。

The older demon moved smoother, albeit he seemed to be limping a little. Seems he finally grew into his human form. He did look a little scrawnier, the hair was a bit darker and longer and there was an attempt at slicking it back..  
老妖怪动作更加流畅，尽管他似乎有点跛脚。看起来他终于变成了人形。他看起来有点瘦弱，头发稍微黑一些，也长了一点，还试图把它梳后。

"I like what you did with your hair," Crowley tried to be conversational.  
克劳利试图与人聊天：“我喜欢你做的发型。”

Hastur spun around, towering over him. "Shut yer bloody mouth you insufferable... Archangel!"  
哈斯特转过身来，高大地站在他面前。“闭上你那该死的嘴，你这个讨厌的...大天使！”

"...What?" 「什么？」

Hastur had ducked to the side. "Archangel at twelve o'clock!"  
哈斯特向一侧闪开。“十二点钟方向有大天使！”

"...What?!" Crowley craned his neck and stared ahead baffled.  
“什么？！”克劳利伸长脖子，困惑地望着前方。

"My twelve o'clock!" Hastur hissed and pulled him behind one of the columns. "Hope they didn't spot us."  
"快躲起来！" 哈斯特低声嘶吼着，将他拽到柱子后面。"希望他们没有发现我们。"

Crowley hazarded a glance around the column.  
克劳利冒险地环顾了一下柱子周围。

Oh joyous day. There were Michael and Uriel, absorbed in conversation, coming their way.  
哦，快乐的一天。迈克尔和乌里尔正在沉浸在对话中，朝他们走来。

"Nice spot-check there," Crowley began, but Hastur put a hand over his mouth.  
"不错的突击检查," 克劳利开始说道，但哈斯特尔将手掌捂在他的嘴上。

"Shh..." "嘘..."

Crowley had to admit the way Hastur moved them into the blind spot of the approaching-then-passing Archangels was a work of art.  
克劳利不得不承认哈斯特尔将他们移动到即将经过的大天使的盲点，真是一种艺术的表现。

"Close one," he said, when Hastur finally withdrew his hand.  
“差一点，”他说道，当哈斯特最终收回了他的手。

The response was a stoic nod.  
回应是一次坚毅的点头。

"Now hurry up!" "快点儿！"

"Easier said than done." Crowley frowned, following Hastur onto a narrow, empty gallery a floor up. "You're about 80% leg."  
说起来容易做起来难。克劳利皱了皱眉，跟随哈斯特尔走上了一条狭窄而空荡的楼廊，楼上还有一层。"你大概有80%的腿。"

Hastur gave him a crooked grin that faltered when he checked Belphegor's device. "Bugger, we dun’ve much time left."  
哈斯特给了他一个歪嘴的笑容，但当他检查贝尔菲戈的装置时，笑容变得有些迟疑。“该死，我们没多少时间了。”

"Pray tell, you two, for what?"  
请告诉我，你们两个，为了什么？

Crowley and Hastur stopped dead in their tracks when Michael, accompanied by two other armed angels, stepped into their path, a satisfied smile on her lips. Behind the two demons, Uriel stepped up to block their way back with another pair of angels.  
克劳利和哈斯特突然停下脚步，当迈克尔带着另外两名武装天使出现在他们面前时，她嘴角带着满意的微笑。在这两个恶魔的身后，乌列尔带着另外两名天使挡住了他们的退路。

"Michael," Hastur began with a full-blown fuck-my-life grin, raising his hands (as did Crowley). "Always a pain t'see ya."  
"迈克尔，"哈斯特满脸苦笑地开始说道，举起双手（克劳利也跟着举起了手）。"总是见到你真是个烦人的事。"

Michael reached up and took off his glasses.  
迈克尔伸手把眼镜摘了下来。

"It's you. Ligur's... boyfriend."  
是你。Ligur的...男朋友。

Hastur rolled his eyes. "'S not a term we 'ave in Hell... Still jealous?" He flashed her a triumphant smirk.  
哈斯特尔翻了个白眼。“地狱里没有这个词……还嫉妒吗？”他得意地冲她咧嘴一笑。

Crowley quirked a suspicious brow at that.  
克劳利对此表示怀疑，眉毛微微一挑。

"Be quiet." Michael scrunched up her nose in distaste, before looking at Crowley. "And you. Surprising seeing you two together, after..." Then she shook her head, some absurdly holy light dancing around her hand while the others readied their weapons. "It won't matter. You have broken into Heaven, the truce is off, and as Head of security, I..."  
"安静点。"迈克尔不满地皱起了鼻子，然后看向克劳利。"你们两个在一起，真是令人惊讶，毕竟之前的事情..."然后她摇了摇头，一些荒谬的神圣之光在她的手上跳动，其他人则准备好了武器。"无所谓了。你们闯入了天堂，停战协议作废了，作为安全主管，我..."

Hastur waved her off. "I know, I know." He let out a long, thoughtful sigh. "For the sake o' everything, do I get last words? There's something I need to know."  
哈斯特挥了挥手。"我知道，我知道。"他长长地叹了口气，若有所思地说道："为了一切，我能说最后的话吗？有些事情我需要知道。"

Michael cocked her head, but held a hand up for the others to wait. And frowned darkly. "Speak then."  
迈克尔歪了一下头，但举起手示意其他人等一等。她皱起眉头，阴沉地说道：“说吧。”

"Would y'say that this' the most harebrained thing any demon's ever done?" said Hastur. "An' I mean compared to the Rebellion an'," he jabbed a thumb at Crowley, "stoppin' Armageddon?"  
“你觉得这是恶魔们做过的最蠢的事情吗？”哈斯特问道。“我是说相比起那次叛乱和”，他用拇指指了指克劳利，“阻止了世界末日？”

"That is one ridiculous question," said Michael. "But yes, even compared to that, it might very well be."  
迈克尔说：“这是一个荒谬的问题。”“但是是的，即使与那个相比，它很有可能是。”

Hastur drew a resigned breath. "You might wanna reconsider that."  
哈斯特尔无奈地叹了口气。“你可能想要重新考虑一下。”

And he decked Michael square in the face.  
他直接打了迈克尔的脸。

"Run!" 快跑！

Crowley didn't need to be told twice.  
克劳利不需要被告诉两次。

~⧖~

Dagon was distressed. 达贡感到烦恼。

"But everyone isz accounted for?" Beelzebub asked, leafing through the files presented to her.  
“但是每个人都有人数吗？”贝利泽布问道，翻阅着递给她的文件。

"Yes. Checked them again and again."  
是的。一遍又一遍地检查过了。

"No matter how you turn it?" Beelzebub leaned back and held a file up against the flickering light.  
“无论你怎么转？”贝尔塞巴斯倚在椅背上，将一份文件举到摇曳的灯光下。

"Numbers are the one thing down here that don’t lie," said Dagon defeatedly, picking up a different file.  
“数字是这里唯一不会撒谎的东西。”达贡沮丧地说着，拿起了另一个文件。

"Any chansze the Maszter'sz wayward szon brought back Duke Ligur now?"  
有没有机会让主人那个任性的儿子把利古尔公爵带回来？

Dagon shook her head. "He'd have reported fer duty already."  
达贡摇了摇头。“他早就应该报到了。”

Beelzebub nodded thoughtfully, putting the file down. "Then we do have a szurplusz demon in Hell."  
贝尔塞巴斯若若有所思地点了点头，将文件放下。“那么地狱确实有一只多余的恶魔。”

~⧖~

Adam had been a bit sad when Miss Anathema and Newt had ultimately left Jasmine Cottage. But life had to go on, hadn't it?  
当Miss Anathema和Newt最终离开茉莉小屋时，亚当有点伤感。但生活必须继续，不是吗？

It also meant the news of a stranger coming to Tadfield had been all the more exciting.  
这也意味着陌生人来到塔德菲尔德的消息更加令人兴奋。

"He has a really cool motorbike," said Pepper, dangling her legs from the low wall. "One of those vintage ones."  
"他有一辆超酷的摩托车，"佩珀坐在低矮的墙上晃动着双腿说道，"那种复古的款式。"

"And he really rented Jasmine Cottage?" Adam was eager to make sure.  
"他真的租了茉莉小屋吗？" 亚当迫不及待地想确认一下。

People with vintage motorbikes didn't usually come to Tadfield.  
有古董摩托车的人通常不会来塔德菲尔德。

"Ya," said Pepper, who only knew this before anyone else because it had been her mother to get the newcomer to the doctor's office after the horseshoe above the door fell off and hit him in the head.  
“呀，”佩珀说道，她比其他人更早知道这件事，因为正是她的母亲把这位新来的人送到医生办公室去看病，当时门上的马蹄铁掉下来正好砸在他头上。

Pepper had told the others as much.  
辣椒已经告诉其他人这个消息了。

Adam though about it. "We should go and make sure he's alright."  
亚当考虑了一下。“我们应该去确认他是否安好。”

The others agreed. 其他人同意了。

Just Dog cocked his head rather curiously, as if listening to the odd hum in the air. Then again, so was Adam. Which, to him, was an even bigger reason to see what all this was about.  
Just Dog扭头好奇地看着，仿佛在倾听空气中奇怪的嗡嗡声。亚当也是如此。对他来说，这更加坚定了他想要弄清楚这一切的原因。

~⧖~

"...so, yes. It certainly is unconventional," Gabriel concluded, "but ask yourself, Aziraphale, in light of what _you_ and that Crowley did, is it really as far off?"  
“所以，是的。这确实是不寻常的，”加百利总结道，“但请问你自己，亚齐拉费尔，在你和那个克劳利所做的事情之后，它真的那么离谱吗？”

Aziraphale sighed softly and looked from the Archangel to his new supervisor.  
亚齐拉费尔轻轻叹了口气，从大天使那里看向他的新主管。

"No," he said. He still didn't know if this was better or worse than the originally intended punishment. "It's just, honestly, he..."  
“不，”他说道。他仍然不知道这是比原本打算的惩罚更好还是更糟。“只是，老实说，他……”

"Sorry to interrupt," came an urgent sounding voice form the door. Michael. "But there's a slight..." she let her gaze wander over the present angels. "...problem. Mind if I speak to you in private?"  
“抱歉打扰一下。”门外传来一个紧急的声音，是迈克尔。“有一个小小的……”她的目光在场中的天使们之间游移。“问题。可以私下谈一下吗？”

Gabriel clapped his hands and rose. "Well, we were done here anyway. You two better hurry along. There's work to be done. Off to Earth you go."  
加布里埃尔拍了拍手，站了起来。“好了，我们在这里也做完了。你们俩最好赶紧走吧，还有工作要做。去地球吧。”

He made a dismissive gesture, and Aziraphale and his new supervisor had no choice but to leave.  
他做了一个不屑的手势，阿齐拉费尔和他的新主管别无选择，只能离开。

"Now, what is it?" Gabriel asked.  
"现在，是什么事情？" 加布里埃尔问道。

"Hell doesn't seem inclined to uphold their end of the deal," said Michael, matter-of-factly. "They sent two demons to break into Heaven."  
“地狱似乎不打算遵守他们的承诺，”迈克尔毫不客气地说道。“他们派了两个恶魔闯入天堂。”

Gabriel seemed surprised. "What do you mean?"  
加布里埃尔似乎很惊讶。“你是什么意思？”

Michael looked back at the door. "It's Crowley and Hastur. We caught them sneaking around Heaven."  
迈克尔回头看着门。“是克劳利和哈斯特。我们抓到他们在天堂里潜行。”

"Is that why you are rubbing your jaw like that?"  
你是因为这个才这样揉着下巴吗？

Michael stiffened and gave the other Archangel a brief glare. "Gabriel, this is serious. Hell has found a way to get into Heaven."  
迈克尔僵硬地瞪了另一个大天使一眼。“加百列，这是严重的。地狱找到了进入天堂的方法。”

"Indefinitely?" "无限期？"

"What?" 什么？

"Now, Michael, you are here, while those two are not. Which means whatever protected them wore off and they're gone for good, or..."  
现在，迈克尔，你在这里，而那两个人不在。这意味着保护他们的东西消失了，他们永远离开了，或者……

Michael's lips became a hair-thin line. "They escaped."  
迈克尔的嘴唇变成了一条细如毛发的线。“他们逃走了。”

Gabriel cocked his head all innocently. "Then find out how they got here, get rid of it, and up the security."  
加布里埃尔无辜地歪了一下头。“那就找出他们是怎么来的，把它消灭掉，然后加强安全措施。”

Michael nodded. "Certainly."  
迈克尔点了点头。“当然。”

"Be on your way then."  
那就走吧。

"Yes." "是的。"

Michael turned, when Gabriel cleared his throat.  
当加百列清了清嗓子时，迈克尔转过身来。

"Ah, just one more thing," he columboed her. "They did escaped to _Hell_, correct? You didn't leave them to roam around Heaven, did you?"  
“啊，还有一件事，”他像哥伦波一样问道，“他们确实逃到了地狱，对吧？你没有让他们在天堂四处游荡，是吗？”

It was days like this when Michael could almost understand Aziraphale very, very well.  
就是这样的日子，迈克尔几乎能够非常非常地理解阿齐拉费尔。

~⧖~

"Bless, that was close," Crowley gasped, trying to catch his breath again. At least Hastur wasn't faring any better.  
“天啊，太危险了。”克劳利喘着气，努力恢复呼吸。至少哈斯特也不好过。

They were slumped against one of the uncountable file drawers, finally certain Heaven's security had lost track of them.  
他们瘫坐在无数文件柜之一旁，终于确定天堂的安全人员已经失去了他们的踪迹。

The good news was they had found the Archives.  
好消息是他们找到了档案馆。

The bad news was everything else.  
坏消息是其他一切。

"What now?" Crowley asked. It wasn't as much a question as it was a necessity. When any given action goes against its planned course, people -including angels and demons- tend to get themselves stuck in some sort of mental holding pattern until someone asks _What now?_ .  
“现在怎么办？”克劳利问道。这不仅仅是一个问题，更是一种必要。当任何行动偏离原计划时，人们（包括天使和恶魔）往往会陷入某种心理停滞状态，直到有人问出“现在怎么办？”

It's a safety measure to prevent effectiveness.  
这是一项安全措施，以防止效果。

"Gimme that note." Hastur held out his hand without looking, and yanked the slip of paper from Crowley as it was held out.  
给我那张纸条。哈斯特伸出手，不看也不管，从克劳利手中抢过了那张纸条。

"We've twenty minutes left." He looked at the drawer next to him, and clambered to his feet. "Doan' dawdle on me."  
我们还剩下二十分钟。他看了一眼旁边的抽屉，然后费力地站了起来。“别在我身上磨蹭。”

Crowley followed, scanning the rows and rows of file drawers.  
克劳利跟着走了过去，扫视着一排排的文件柜。

"Ah, bless it," he ultimately muttered, tilting his head back.  
"啊，真是让人感动啊，"他最终喃喃自语，仰头望天。

"Wot?" "什么？"

"I think it's all the way up there," said Crowley, and pointed from the bottom drawer up to the ceiling. "I'll see if there's a ladder."  
“我觉得它就在那边上面。”克劳利说着，指着从底层抽屉一直指向天花板。“我去看看有没有梯子。”

Hastur looked at him blankly and grabbed his arm as Crowley turned to go. "Normally I'd gladly let you go an' do that crap. But as we dun have the time... you can fly, you bastard."  
哈斯特茫然地看着他，当克劳利转身离去时，他抓住了他的胳膊。“通常我会很乐意让你去做那些破事。但是我们没时间了...你可以飞，混蛋。”

"...Oh, yes, right." Crowley shook himself free and spread his wings. "B-R-B." And he took flight, albeit a bit clumsily.  
“哦，是的，没错。”克劳利挣脱了束缚，展开了他的翅膀。“一会儿回来。”然后他飞起来，虽然有点笨拙。

"Be Are... really now?" Hastur grumbled, before checking his device again. They had wasted so much bloody time.  
“真的吗……现在还是这样？”哈斯特嘟囔着，然后再次检查了他的设备。他们浪费了这么多该死的时间。

"It's gone." Crowley swooped down next to him.  
“没了。”克劳利俯身落在他旁边。

"Wot?" "什么？"

"The file, it's not there. Every other file is, just not the one we're..."  
文件，不在那里。其他所有文件都在，就是我们要找的那一个...

Hastur looked as if he was about to bite Crowley's head off.  
哈斯特看起来好像要咬掉克劳利的头。

"Then get the others," he growled.  
"然后把其他人也找来，"他咆哮道。

"Far ahead of you." Crowley smiled and held up two folders. "Did you think I'd look forward to facing the Dark Council empty handed? Those guys are pissed at me."  
“远远领先于你。”克劳利微笑着举起两个文件夹。“你以为我会毫无准备地面对黑暗议会吗？那些家伙对我很生气。”

"Wonder why," said Hastur dryly, and grabbed a folder, stuffing it under his shirt. "Now for the fun part..."  
“好奇怪，”哈斯特干巴巴地说着，然后抓起一个文件夹，塞进了衬衫下。“现在是有趣的部分了……”

Crowley sighed. "Getting back to Hell. Any plan? I mean, Michael's probably not taking too well to you punching her." He paused and cracked his neck a little awkwardly. "And credit where it's due, that was a work of art."  
克劳利叹了口气。“回到地狱的计划呢？我的意思是，迈克尔可能对你打她不太满意。”他停顿了一下，有点尴尬地扭了扭脖子。“不过，要承认你的功劳，那真是一件艺术品。”

Hastur flashed him a pleased grin. "We can always take the ol' way out of Heaven."  
哈斯特露出了满意的笑容。“我们总可以走老路离开天堂。”

"Million light years freestyle diving isn't really a beloved hobby of mine." Crowley squirmed a little.  
百万光年自由潜水并不是我特别喜爱的爱好。克劳利有些不安地扭动了一下。

"Eh, suit yourself." 随你便。

"There they are!" a voice called and Hastur and Crowley whipped around.  
“就在那里！”一个声音喊道，哈斯特尔和克劳利转身看去。

"Ah, shit," said Crowley. Hastur just made a displeased sound and ducked between the shelves.  
“啊，该死。”克劳利说道。哈斯特只是发出了不悦的声音，然后躲进了书架之间。

"Meetcha on the way back down," he called, leaving Crowley standing.  
“下山的路上见吧。”他喊道，留下克劳利站在那里。

For the shortest moment Crowley was baffled. Not so much at Hastur leaving him to fend for himself, but at the prospect of the senior demon genuinely expecting him to get out of there. Not that he had a lot of time to dwell on that. There were angels approaching and it wasn't much of a question if they were rather smiting-happy.  
克劳利短暂的瞬间感到困惑。不是因为哈斯特尔抛下他自己，而是因为高级恶魔真的期望他能够离开那里。不过他没有太多时间思考这个问题。天使们正在接近，他们对于毁灭非常热衷，这已经不是一个问题了。

Crowley looked around. There was a gallery a few levels up, and an archway leading out. Seemed the way out was up.  
克劳利四处张望。几层楼上有一个画廊，还有一座通向外面的拱门。看起来出去的路是向上的。

It should be noted that flying is not like riding a bicycle or wielding a flaming sword. Even if you have a bag-full of additional bones and muscles, it takes continued training to use wings well.  
需要注意的是，飞行并不像骑自行车或挥舞火焰之剑那样简单。即使你有一袋子额外的骨骼和肌肉，也需要持续的训练才能熟练运用翅膀。

Now, under general circumstance, demons would be at an advantage. They are more into theatricals than Heaven\*\*, and being able to spread an impressive set of wings is a windfall to that cause.  
现在，在一般情况下，恶魔会占据优势。他们更喜欢戏剧性的表演，而能展开一双令人印象深刻的翅膀对于这个目的来说是个意外之财。

The issue was that in 6000 years on Earth Crowley had used his wings thrice.\*\*\*  
问题在于克劳利在地球上6000年只使用了他的翅膀三次。\*\*\*

So he might have been a little out of practice.  
所以他可能有点生疏。

Which, however, didn't matter, as the angels decided to follow him on foot.  
然而，这并不重要，因为天使们决定步行跟随他。

"You guys really aren't the sharpest prongs on the pitchfork," he murmured as he realized as much, pulling himself over the railing and unto the gallery.  
“你们真的不是草叉上最锋利的叉齿。”他低声自语着，意识到这一点，他拉着自己越过栏杆，进入了画廊。

\*\* Gabriel and Uriel not withstanding.  
加百列和乌列尔不在此列。

\*\*\* He refused to count the one time during his brief visit to America back in 1966, as that had gone quite a bit sideways.  
他拒绝将1966年他短暂访美期间的那次经历算在内，因为那次经历出了些问题。

Now what? 现在怎么办？

The way ahead seemed clear. Good.  
前方的道路似乎清晰无阻。很好。

Crowley winched his wings back in and started running, bringing up a mental map of what he knew of Heaven's current layout.  
克劳利收回了他的翅膀，开始奔跑，脑海中浮现出他对天堂当前布局的心理地图。

Straight ahead, two left, straight, right, straight.  
直走，左转两次，直走，右转，直走。

And with each corridor he passed through there were more angels on his heels.  
每穿过一个走廊，他身后就有更多的天使。

Bugger. 该死。

Crowley might have wondered how Hastur was faring, had he A) not spotted the senior demon fighting with a bunch of angels down in the courtyard and B) his train of thoughts been interrupted by a baneful beeping.  
克劳利或许会想知道哈斯特尔的近况，如果A) 他没有发现高级恶魔正在庭院与一群天使激战，以及B) 他的思绪没有被一声恶毒的嘟嘟声打断。

Shit. 糟糕。

Crowley stopped at the railing overlooking the courtyard, and stared at the device.  
克劳利停在俯瞰庭院的栏杆旁，凝视着那个装置。

Five more minutes, and counting.  
再给我五分钟，倒计时开始。

Shitshit_shit_ . 糟糕糟糕糟糕。

He had to get down to the courtyard, pronto.  
他必须立刻下到庭院。

Now, the stairs were over there. Nope, too far away, too many angels in the path.  
现在，楼梯在那边。不对，太远了，路径上有太多的天使。

Well, there _was_ one way.  
嗯，有一种方法。

Jump the railing, land in the fountain (it was pretty deep Crowley had observed), clamber out, make a run for it.  
跳过栏杆，落入喷泉中（克劳利观察到它相当深），爬出来，狂奔而去。

Crowley did so. 克劳利这样做了。

Remembering just the fraction of a second too late _what_ a fountain in _Heaven_ would be filled with.  
在那一刹那稍稍晚了一点点才想起天堂的喷泉会装满什么。

_Shit!  糟糕！_

He paled, twisting mid-fall. Now, had the prospect of landing in a fountain full of holy water not overwritten every other thought, he might have thought of spreading his wings and landing _next_ to it.  
他脸色苍白，身体在下落中扭曲。现在，如果不是被落入一池充满神圣水的前景所覆盖，他可能会想到展开翅膀，在它旁边着陆。

But as it were this thought wasn't able to push its way through to the front.  
但是这个想法似乎无法挤进前排。

He pressed his eyes shut and tried to brace himself for the fatal and terminal bath he was heading for.  
他紧闭双眼，试图为即将面临的致命和终极的浴池做好准备。

There was some beautiful, poetic justice in that, wasn't there?  
那真是一种美丽而富有诗意的正义，不是吗？

Funny how _that_ thought managed to elbow its way through.  
真有趣，这个想法竟然设法挤进来了。

What happened then, however, didn't really fit with plunging head-first into a body of Holy Water.  
然而，接下来发生的事情并不符合毫不犹豫地头朝下跳入圣水中的情景。

Crowley opened his eyes again, wincing when he found himself dangling upside-down just inches above the water's surface.  
克劳利再次睁开眼睛，发现自己头朝下悬挂在水面上方仅几英寸处，他不禁皱了皱眉。

Then he looked back up along his body.  
然后他抬头看着自己的身体。

"I hate you so much," Hastur hissed down at him, holding onto Crowley's leg.  
“我非常讨厌你。”哈斯特嘶声嘶气地对着他说道，紧紧抓住克劳利的腿。

Hastur's wings were out, the left one a mangled, flapping mess that barely allowed for flying. He glared down at Crowley, before swinging him to the side, letting himself get pulled along by the momentum.  
哈斯特的翅膀展开，左翅膀破烂不堪，几乎无法飞行。他怒视着克劳利，然后将他甩到一边，让自己被动力带动着前进。

There's that saying about how Evil cannot comprehend Good. Luckily, Good had its problems with comprehending Good, too, right now, on account of Good being done by Evil.  
有一句话说邪恶无法理解善良。幸运的是，善良也有困难理解善良，现在就是因为善良被邪恶所做的缘故。

It left the Heavenly Host dumbfounded long enough for Crowley and Hastur to shove, elbow and push their way back to the elevator back home.  
这让天使们目瞪口呆，足够让克劳利和哈斯特挤过去，推开回家的电梯。

Didn't mean Heaven wasn't on their heels.  
并不是说天堂没有追赶他们。

"C'moncmon_cmon_!" Crowley muttered, pressing the button to close the doors like they do in such scenes in movies.  
"快点快点快点！" 克劳利嘟囔着，按下按钮，就像电影里那样关闭门。

And just like in the movies the doors closed just as some projectile weapon headed their way.  
就像电影中一样，当一些投射武器朝他们飞来时，门突然关闭了。

Crowley wasn't certain what it was, but it kinda looked like a water balloon.  
克劳利不确定那是什么东西，但它有点像一个水球。

As the numbers on the display started going down, he sat back against the wall exhausted, and looked at Hastur.  
当显示屏上的数字开始下降时，他疲惫地靠在墙上，望着哈斯特尔。

"You..." he began, and Hastur grabbed him by his shirt, pulling him nose to nose.  
"你..." 他开始说道，哈斯特一把抓住他的衬衫，将他的鼻子拉到了一起。

"Not. One. Word," he snarled, before slumping back. His wings were still out, at least for a moment. Just long enough for Crowley to realize just how bad the left one's state was.  
“一个字都不许说。”他咆哮着，然后瘫倒回去。他的翅膀还展开着，至少还有一会儿。克劳利意识到左边的翅膀有多糟糕，这个时间足够长了。

With a long, agonized groan Hastur winched them back in.  
哈斯特尔发出一声长而痛苦的呻吟，将他们拉了回来。

"Whatcha looking at?" 你在看什么？

Crowley contemplated if he could be smarmy and point out the 'Not one word' order.  
克劳利思考着是否可以耍滑头，指出“一字不许说”的命令。

Sitting down and looking at what they'd gotten seemed the healthier choice.  
坐下来看看他们得到了什么似乎是更明智的选择。

"Jus' so we're clear," said Hastur, fiddling with the file, "I'm just not keen on facing the Dark Council on me own. Otherwise you'd be celestial gumbo now."  
“就这么说清楚了，”哈斯特儿摆弄着文件说道，“我只是不太愿意独自面对黑暗议会。否则你现在早就成了天界的炖菜了。”

Crowley huffed. "Fair enough."  
克劳利咕哝了一声。“好吧。”

"An' there wasn't enough time t' hang around an' watch you get yer just dessert." Hastur fell silent, studying the files they had. Then he threw them back at Crowley with a howl of despair. "Ledgers," he snarled, twisting dirty fingers into his hair. "They nearly got us killed fer bloody outdated ledgers!"  
“而且没有足够的时间在这里闲逛，看着你得到你应得的惩罚。”哈斯特尔沉默了下来，仔细研究着他们手上的文件。然后他绝望地将它们扔回给克劳利，发出一声嚎叫。“账簿，”他咆哮着，用脏兮兮的手指揪住自己的头发。“为了该死的过时账簿，它们差点害了我们性命！”

Naturally, it was then that the lights overhead started flickering, heralding their descent into Hell's territory.  
自然而然，就在那时，头顶上的灯光开始闪烁，预示着他们即将降临地狱的领域。

~⧖~

"I'm so sorry, my dears, but I think you just missed him," said Miss Magnolia (Miss Mag for short), the woman who had moved into Tadfield a few months ago.  
“非常抱歉，亲爱的们，但我想你们刚刚错过了他，”在几个月前搬到塔德菲尔德的女士玛格诺利亚小姐（简称玛格小姐）说道。

She reminded Adam a bit of Madame Tracy. A pastel version of Madame Tracy that is.  
她让亚当有点想起了特蕾西夫人。不过是特蕾西夫人的柔和版本。

"He's a writer, that one," said Miss Mag, as the Them gathered around her. "Being out here for inspiration, he says." She smiled the kind of smile one smiles when they know they've found a like-minded soul.  
“他是个作家，那个人。”玛格小姐说道，当他们聚集在她周围时。“他说他在这里寻找灵感。”她微笑着，那种当他们知道找到一个志同道合的灵魂时的微笑。

"What's he writing?" asked Adam. They might have missed the mysterious newcomer (who's name apparently was Harry Nicholas), but Miss Mag was always happy to have a little chat with them about the exciting odds and ends that managed to slip by the children.  
"他在写什么？" 亚当问道。他们可能错过了那个神秘的新来者（据说名叫哈里·尼古拉斯），但麦格小姐总是乐意与他们聊一聊那些让孩子们错过的令人兴奋的琐事。

"Oh, mysteries and somesuch. The whole spooky stuff, he says."  
哦，神秘和诸如此类的东西。整个吓人的东西，他说。

The Them listened with growing excitement to what Miss Mag told them about Mr Nicholas.  
他们越听越兴奋地倾听着Mag小姐关于Nicholas先生的讲述。

That he was charming and very clever, but a little on the confrontational side. Spent a lot of time asking questions. But he was a writer, wasn't he? They ought to ask questions.  
他很迷人，非常聪明，但有点好争论。花了很多时间提问。但他是个作家，不是吗？作家应该提问。

Dog meanwhile was sniffing around the garden of Jasmine Cottage.  
狗与此同时在茉莉小屋的花园里嗅来嗅去。

And let out a low whine.  
然后发出低低的呜咽声。

~⧖~

"Don't dilly-dally," the minor demon that picked Crowley and Hastur up from the elevator said, and led them down another winding corridor.  
“别磨磨蹭蹭的。”从电梯里接走克劳利和哈斯特的小恶魔说道，然后带领他们走进另一个弯曲的走廊。

Crowley had no doubt they were taking the long route to wherever they were being led on purpose. The dark, suspicious glance he earned from the demons they passed made his hair stand on end. Now even worse than before.  
克劳利毫不怀疑他们被故意带到了一个远离目的地的绕路上。他从经过的恶魔那里得到的阴暗、可疑的目光让他毛骨悚然。现在比以前更糟糕了。

"You... are not leading us to the Phantasmagoetia," he ventured at some point.  
"你...并没有带领我们去幻影魔法书," 他在某个时候冒险说道。

The minor demon didn't respond. So Crowley did grasp the last straw and looked at Hastur.  
小恶魔没有回应。所以克劳利抓住最后一根稻草，看向哈斯特尔。

"Y'ought to come down here more often," came the response, without Hastur even looking at him. He was staring straight ahead, hands burrowed in his pockets. And he looked as if he was feeling as unwell in his hide as Crowley. Maybe even worse.  
“你应该更经常过来这里。”哈斯特毫不理会他的话，回答道。他直视前方，双手深深插在口袋里。他看起来和克劳利一样不舒服，甚至可能更糟。

Crowley quirked a brow. Then realization hit him.  
克劳利挑了挑眉毛。然后他意识到了。

"Oh... _No_ ." 哦...不好。

"Yes," said Hastur. “是的，”哈斯特说道。

The minor demon led them down a narrow staircase and through a large double-door.  
小恶魔带领他们走下一条狭窄的楼梯，穿过一扇大的双开门。

Into Hell's Council Hall.  
进入地狱议会大厅。

Crowley had to give them credit. It now looked like a minimalistic post-modern take on ancient thea-... He did a small double-take.  
克劳利不得不承认他们的功劳。现在看起来像是对古老神秘主义的极简主义后现代诠释……他微微瞪大了眼睛。

Next to him, Hastur smirked.  
在他旁边，哈斯特得意地笑了笑。

"Ah, forgot you haven't actually been here yet," he said. "Council decided t' move things here," he jabbed a thumb at the window behind them. "Gives people a better view."  
"啊，忘了你还没来过这里呢，"他说道。"议会决定把事情搬到这里来了，"他用拇指指了指他们身后的窗户。"这样人们可以有更好的视野了。"

The minor demon left, and another door slid open.  
小恶魔离开了，另一扇门滑开了。

No matter his actions and demeanor before, Crowley suddenly felt very, very small as the Dark Council entered.  
不管他之前的行为和举止如何，当黑暗议会进入时，克劳利突然感到非常非常渺小。

It had been decades since the Council met publicly, and they hadn't even come together for Crowley's _trial_ .  
自从委员会公开会议以来已经过去了几十年，他们甚至没有为克劳利的审判而聚集在一起。

Yep, this was really not Crowley's day today.  
是的，今天对克劳利来说真的不是个好日子。

"All rise in the presence of the Dark Council!" the usher called, and Crowley watched the Archdemons enter. He couldn't say what was worse. Asmodeus and Belphegor's indifference, Mammon's hateful glare (Ligur had been one of his best underlings to Crowley's knowledge), Leviathan's spitefulness or Beelzebub's glee.  
“黑暗议会在场，众人起立！”传达员喊道，克劳利看着大恶魔们进入。他无法说出哪个更糟。阿斯莫德和贝尔菲戈的冷漠，玛蒙的仇恨目光（据克劳利所知，利古尔曾是他最好的下属），利维坦的恶意或贝利亚尔的欢喜。

"Hey, filling in for the Big Boss again?" said Crowley before he could stop himself.  
“嘿，又替大老板顶班了？”克劳利不禁说出口。

"Silensze!" Beelzebub snarled, sitting down.  
"安静！" 贝尔撒巴咆哮着坐下来。

Crowley snapped his mouth shut.  
克劳利闭上了嘴巴。

"The Dark Counszil isz in session!" Beelzebub called and looked at the two lower demons. "You were taszked with retrieving a file from Heaven's Archives. The counszil congratulatesz you on not dying. Where'sz the file?"  
"黑暗议会正在开会！"贝利泽布大声喊道，目光落在两个下级恶魔身上。"你们被派去从天堂档案馆取回一个文件。议会对你们没有死亡表示祝贺。文件在哪里？"

Crowley and Hastur drew a sharp breath at the same time. For other demons this would have been the moment to rat each other out. But, for some reason, neither Hastur nor Crowley said anything.  
克劳利和哈斯特同时倒抽了一口气。对于其他恶魔来说，这本应是彼此出卖的时刻。但出于某种原因，哈斯特和克劳利都没有说出任何话。

Not that it mattered. 无关紧要。

Asmodeus and Belphegor rose and moved to stand behind Hastur and Crowley, respectively. Crowley knew what was coming, and he hated that more than the knowledge pouring.  
阿斯莫德和贝尔菲戈站起身来，分别站在哈斯图尔和克劳利的身后。克劳利知道接下来会发生什么，他对此比知识的涌入更加厌恶。

He managed a choking gasp as Belphegor put her hand on the side of his face, and then everything went a little fuzzy. Through the fog in his brain he heard himself and Hastur give a detailed account of what happened.  
当贝尔菲戈尔把手放在他脸上时，他勉强喘息了一口气，然后一切都变得有些模糊。在他脑海中的迷雾中，他听到自己和哈斯特详细描述了发生的事情。

He really, really, really hated the puppeteering their respective Archdemons were capable of. A part of his brain reminded him that it was good that Belphegor had not been awake during the _trial_ . He didn't want to imagine what would have happened if... He shuddered, partly because of that, partly because of Belphegor having withdrawn her hand and was now returning to her seat.  
他真的、真的、真的非常讨厌他们各自的大恶魔所能做的操纵傀儡的能力。他脑海中的一部分提醒他，贝尔菲戈在审判期间没有醒来是件好事。他不想想象如果...会发生什么。他不禁打了个寒颤，一部分是因为那个，一部分是因为贝尔菲戈已经抽回了手，现在正返回自己的座位。

Beelzebub, meanwhile, was leafing through the files. "Thisz iszn't what we aszk for, but under the given circumsztanszes..."  
比尔泽布正在翻阅文件。"这不是我们要求的，但在给定的情况下..."

There was a bit of murmuring between the Council, and Beelzebub finally looked back at the lower demons.  
议会之间有些窃窃私语，最后贝尔撒巴回头看着下位恶魔。

"Duke Hastur, you may conszider yourszelf reinstated in rank and reszourcesz."  
哈斯特公爵，你可以认为自己恢复了职位和资源。

Hastur nodded curtly, rubbing his neck.  
哈斯特短暂地点了点头，揉了揉脖子。

Crowley however whipped around. "Wait. You had been _demoted_? Don't tell me I've been your superior this entire time."  
然而，克劳利突然转过身来。“等等。你被降职了？别告诉我这整个时间我一直是你的上级。”

Hastur cocked his head. And smiled like a snake.  
哈斯特尔歪着头，像蛇一样微笑着。

"Ah," he said. "Knew there was something I forgot t'tell ya'bout."  
"啊，"他说道。"知道有件事我忘了告诉你的。"

"However," said Beelzebub after a dreadful pause that was _just_ long enough to _almost_ let Hastur relish in his victory as much as he'd have liked to. "There will be a new asszignment for you."  
然而，贝尔则博在一段可怕的停顿后说道，这段停顿的时间几乎足够让哈斯特尽情享受他的胜利，就像他本想的那样。“不过，你将有一个新的任务。”

Hastur nodded again, albeit a little taken aback. And caught the slip of paper that appeared in midair. Belphegor looked at Crowley.  
哈斯特再次点了点头，虽然有点吃惊。然后接住了在半空中出现的纸条。贝尔菲戈尔看着克劳利。

"As for you. Impressive work. You are free to return to the surface. But, from now on you'll be accompanied by a..." she cast an amused look at Hastur, "Uh... chaperone."  
至于你，干得漂亮。你可以自由返回地面了。但是，从现在开始，你将会有一个……"她笑着看了哈斯特一眼，"嗯……陪同者。"

Both Crowley and Hastur stiffened.  
克劳利和哈斯特尔都变得僵硬起来。

"What?" they blurted out in unison, followed by an equally synchronized glower at the other.  
"什么？" 他们异口同声地喊道，随后又同步地怒视对方。

"It's been decided before this meeting even took place," Asmodeus added, smiling at the duo with the kind and friendly expression of a TV preacher. "Duke Hastur, just let it be said you are not to harm your ward. Are there any complaints you would like to make?"  
“这次会议之前就已经决定了。”阿斯莫德斯笑着对着这对夫妇，带着电视传教士般友善和善良的表情说道，“哈斯图公爵，只要说一下，你不得伤害你的被监护人。你有什么意见要提出吗？”

_Plenty_, Crowley thought bitterly, looking at Hastur, who, by the looks of it, not only shared his sentiments, but was inwardly blessing profusely.  
克劳利心中充满了苦涩，他看着哈斯特尔，后者不仅与他有着相同的感受，而且内心深处还在大量祝福着。

"None," said Hastur then, standing stiff as a plank.  
"没有," 哈斯图尔板着脸说道，站得笔直如木板。

"You may leave then. Your asszignment awaitsz. Do not diszappoint usz."  
你可以离开了。你的任务在等着你。不要让我们失望。

Crowley couldn't get out of the Council Hall fast enough. Blessed Heaven, he should have expected this.  
克劳利急不可耐地离开了议会大厅。天哪，他早该料到这一点了。

Especially after Aziraphale mentioned this supervisor thing.  
特别是在亚齐拉费尔提到这个主管的事情之后。

This wasn't fair. 这不公平。

Oh, who was he kidding? This was Hell, he had stopped the Apocalypse AND killed a higher ranking demon, and all that Jazz. Under these circumstances whatever he had coming with this chaperone business could be counted as 'fair'.  
哦，他在开玩笑吗？这简直是地狱，他已经阻止了天启，还杀了一个更高级的恶魔，还有那些琐事。在这种情况下，他所要面对的陪同任务可以算作是“公平”的。

He straightened his posture and looked back at Hastur, who was leaning against the wall, almost melting into the shadows.  
他挺直了身子，回头看着哈斯特尔，后者靠在墙上，几乎融入了阴影之中。

"Guess we're, err, living together then...?" said Crowley, in his best damage-control tone.  
“猜猜我们，呃，要一起住了吧……？”克劳利用尽最好的修复语气说道。

Hastur looked up from the note he'd been studying, and quirked a brow. "Naw. Not a chance."  
哈斯特从他一直在研究的纸条上抬起头，挑了挑眉毛。“不可能。”

Crowley whistled through his teeth. "_You_ defying orders? I'll be blessed."  
克劳利用牙齿发出了一个口哨声。“你违抗命令？真是让我感到荣幸。”

Hastur grinned, "Careful what you wish for." He handed him the note.  
哈斯特微笑着说：“小心你所期望的。”他递给他一张纸条。

It was an address. 这是一个地址。

Crowley was about to say something about Hastur knowing his flat, when the address wormed its way into his brain.  
克劳利正要说哈斯特尔知道他的公寓的事情，当地址悄悄地钻进他的脑海。

He did a double-take. 他瞪大了眼睛。

"I'm not _your_ chaperone, Crowley," said Hastur, with some undeniable amusement. "Am to keep an eye on that angel of yours."  
“克劳利，我可不是你的监护人，”哈斯图尔笑着说道，“我只是负责照看你那个天使而已。”

"But..." Crowley began, and stopped, not knowing what else to put behind that 'but'.  
“但是……” 克劳利开始说道，然后停了下来，不知道接下来该说什么。

"But what?" _Of course_ Hastur had to ask. Thankfully he also answered his own question. "You heard the council. Am not to harm 'me ward'." He gave Crowley a look that mustered more bitter hate than Hell had to offer. "C'mon, I need something t'eat before we leave."  
“但是什么？”哈斯特尔当然得问。幸运的是，他也回答了自己的问题。“你听到议会的了。我不能伤害‘我的被监护人’。”他给了克劳利一个目光，比地狱所能提供的更多的苦涩和仇恨。“走吧，我们离开之前我需要吃点东西。”

He stalked past Crowley with the same long strides as before.  
他以前那样大步流星地从克劳利身边走过。

Well, food sounded good. 嗯，食物听起来不错。

Crowley followed. 克劳利跟随着。

Then he realized Hastur was heading for _Hell's_ food court.  
然后他意识到哈斯特正朝地狱美食广场走去。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

~⧖~

Miss Mag was by now 41 years old and emitted the aura of a little old lady sleuth. A circumstance she took great pride in and drew a lot of joy from. Mysteries, especially those of the supernatural kind, held a special place in her heart. That was why she had moved to Tadfield. What with all the odds and ends that happened and are happening here, she was certain she'd finally get into an adventure.  
玛格小姐现在已经41岁了，散发着一种老奶奶侦探的氛围。这是她非常自豪并从中获得了很多快乐的事情。神秘事件，尤其是超自然的那种，占据了她心中的特殊位置。这就是为什么她搬到了塔德菲尔德的原因。考虑到这里发生的种种奇怪事情，她相信自己终于能够参与一次冒险了。

Alright, maybe she wasn't _certain_ .  
好吧，也许她不确定。

Miss Mag was never certain about these things.  
麦格小姐对这些事情从来都不确定。

One, because as much as she believed in these things, she knew, deep in her pastel-colored soul, that these kind of things didn't happen to ordinary people. It was frustrating.  
一，因为尽管她对这些事情深信不疑，但她深知在她那柔和色彩的灵魂深处，这种事情并不会发生在普通人身上。这让她感到沮丧。

Two, Miss Mag considered herself an excitement repellant. No matter where she went or which stories she followed everything interesting seemed to have gone out for lunch until she left.  
二，玛格小姐自认为是个令人兴奋的驱逐剂。无论她去哪里或者追随哪个故事，所有有趣的事情似乎都在她离开之前消失了。

She'd been to the middle of nowhere in Africa only for a small war to break out not too long after she left. She'd been to the Middle East only for some archaeological sensation to be discovered shortly after she boarded her plane back home (she even had trouble remembering what it was, but she heard the US ambassador got there, too, once she had left). Lisa, an old colleague, once told her that things had gotten weird just after Mag had left her telemarketer job.  
她曾经去过非洲的一个偏远地方，但她离开后不久就爆发了一场小规模战争。她曾经去过中东，但她回家的飞机刚起飞不久就有人发现了一些考古的重大发现（她甚至记不清具体是什么，但她听说美国大使也是在她离开后才到达那里的）。曾经的同事Lisa告诉她，在Mag离开她的电话销售工作后，事情变得很奇怪。

Excitement avoided Miss Mag it would seem.  
看起来，麦格小姐避免了兴奋。

But Tadfield, she hoped, was too much of what they call a _'weirdness magnet'_ for that to happen.  
但是她希望塔德菲尔德太过于吸引怪事的地方，所以不会发生那种事情。

She had already met Mr Nicholas. A middle-aged, clever, good-looking and reclusive writer coming to a town like Tadfield for inspiration had to be a good start.  
她已经见过尼古拉斯先生了。一个中年、聪明、英俊而隐居的作家来到像塔德菲尔德这样的小镇寻找灵感，这肯定是个好的开始。

And he was charming as all hell, Miss Mag found.\*  
而他简直迷人得不得了，玛格小姐发现的。

\* Naturally, metaphorically speaking. We know there's nothing charming about Hell. Except maybe for that thing Mammon recovered from Leviathan's lair recently. No one knows what it is, but it's absolutely charming.  
自然地，就是比喻而言。我们知道地狱没有什么迷人之处。除了最近魔王从利维坦的巢穴中找到的那个东西。没有人知道它是什么，但它绝对迷人。

Then there were, of course, the Them. She had been warned about the children, but she had found them most endearing. Especially Adam, who seemed eager to know as much about everything peculiar Miss Mag could tell stories about, and Pepper, who always had an open ear for Miss Mag's thoughts on the world in general.  
当然，还有他们。她曾经被警告过这些孩子，但她发现他们非常可爱。尤其是亚当，他似乎渴望了解关于怪异事物的所有信息，而佩珀总是对麦格小姐对世界的思考保持着敞开的耳朵。

And even if Miss Mag hadn't met any interesting person in Tadfield, there was the whole interesting area to explore. There were the woods, of course, and there was the old mansion nearby. Miss Mag had long since been planning to go there. She had heard it had been a convent about a decade back.  
即使在塔德菲尔德，玛格小姐没有遇到任何有趣的人，但整个有趣的地区还是值得探索的。当然，那里有树林，还有附近的古老庄园。玛格小姐早就计划去那里。她听说那里在十年前曾是一个修道院。

Something exciting had to happen soon. It just had to.  
很快就会发生令人兴奋的事情。就是这样。

And this time it would have no way to avoid Miss Mag.  
这一次，它将无法避开麦格小姐。

~⧖~

Hell's Food Court was everything one could expect, and less.  
地狱美食广场是人们所期望的一切，却又不尽如人意。

It was grimy, stinking, and cramped, but some of the chairs matched.  
虽然肮脏、臭气熏天、狭小拥挤，但其中一些椅子还是相配的。

The sides of the large hall were lined with giant cauldrons and charcoal grills, all smoking, sizzling, bubbling and belching steam.  
大厅的两侧摆满了巨大的锅和炭炉，冒着烟，嘶嘶作响，冒着泡沫，喷出蒸汽。

Hastur was currently digging into something that at least looked like fried rice with poached eggs and chunks of bacon. Crowley knew better though.  
哈斯特目前正在挖掘一些看起来像炒饭的东西，上面有水煮蛋和培根块。克劳利知道得更清楚。

"Gone bloody native," Hastur snarled, mouth full. Crowley was sitting opposite to him, elbows rested on the table. "You gotta eat. Much as I'd like t'see you drop dead."  
“变得该死的本土化了。”哈斯特咆哮着，满嘴食物。克劳利坐在他对面，手肘搁在桌子上。“你得吃点东西。尽管我很想看到你死掉。”

Crowley gave him a glower.  
克劳利瞪了他一眼。

"We've been to Heaven," said Hastur, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. "'S much as I've gotta give credit to Lord Belphegor, 'twas still gettin' at me core. An' I dun think yer faring better."  
“我们去过天堂。”哈斯图尔擦了擦嘴巴，用袖子擦了擦。 “虽然我得承认贝尔菲戈尔大人做得很好，但还是触动了我的内心。而且我觉得你的情况也不会好到哪去。”

"Since when do you care?" Crowley snarled back, tugging on his clothes. Granted, Hastur had some sort of point. Crowley had already felt a significant change in his very core just when they changed back into their own clothes. But...  
"你从什么时候开始在乎了？" 克劳利咆哮着回答，一边拽着自己的衣服。诚然，哈斯特有点道理。当他们换回自己的衣服时，克劳利已经感觉到自己的核心发生了重大变化。但是...

"I don't." Hastur let his spoon clang into the empty bowl and got up, wandering over to one of the cauldrons.  
“我不。”哈斯特把勺子砰地放在空碗里，站起身来，漫步到其中一个大锅旁边。

Crowley laid his head on the table with a heavy groan.  
克劳利沉重地呻吟着，将头放在桌子上。

Then he rose, wiped something that looked like moldy silly putty off his cheek and laid back down.  
然后他站起来，擦掉脸颊上看起来像发霉的傻乎乎的塑料泥，然后躺了回去。

They were dead meat, weren't they? He couldn't trust Hastur with Aziraphale (even less than he'd trust any other demon with the angel), and he didn't want to imagine what his own supervisor would be like.  
他们完蛋了，是吧？他不能相信哈斯特尔会对亚齐拉费尔做出什么（甚至比他对其他恶魔对天使的信任还要少），而且他不想去想象自己的上司会是什么样子。

"'Ow d'ye keep messing up simple stuff like this?" Hastur interrupted Crowley’s thoughts as he sat back down.  
“你怎么老是把这种简单的事情搞砸？”哈斯图尔打断了克劳利的思绪，他重新坐了下来。

Crowley looked up blearily. "What?"  
克劳利迷迷糊糊地抬起头。“什么？”

"Delivering the Antichrist, not stoppin' Armageddon, not gettin' caught when sneaking through Heaven. Shouldn't been hard, but you messed up each. How?" said Hastur, slurping away on what was clearly broth with eyeballs. "'S’not exactly mineralogy."  
“交付邪基督，不停止末日，不在偷偷穿越天堂时被抓住。本来不应该难，但你每次都搞砸了。怎么回事？”哈斯特说着，啜饮着显然是有眼球的汤。“这可不是矿物学。”

"_What_?" 什么？

"Could almost pity whatever poor sod Upstairs's forcing to deal with you." Hastur paused, moving the spoon around his mouth like a lollipop. "Who d'ye think you'll get?"  
“几乎可怜那个可怜的家伙，楼上的人强迫他与你打交道。”哈斯图尔停下来，像吃棒棒糖一样在嘴里转动勺子。“你觉得你会得到谁？”

"What?" 什么？

"You keep askin' that." 你老是问这个。

Crowley bristled. "That's because you're not making any sense."  
克劳利愤怒地皱起了眉头。“那是因为你说的话毫无意义。”

"'Ow's wonderin' what angel you'll gets stuck wi' not makin' sense?"  
“瞧瞧你会碰上哪个天使，还不知道他会说些什么呢？”

"That's not what..." Crowley decided to not harp on it. "Dunno," he said instead. "Who's in the biggest trouble with Heaven?"  
“那不是…” 克劳利决定不再纠缠这个问题。“不知道，”他改口说道。“谁和天堂的关系最糟糕？”

"Aziraphale." 阿齐拉费尔。

Well, Hastur wasn't wrong.  
嗯，哈斯特并没有错。

"You _know_ what I mean."  
你知道我在说什么。

Hastur shrugged, popping an eyeball between his molars. "You really ought t'eat."  
哈斯特耸了耸肩，将一只眼球夹在他的磨牙之间。“你真应该吃点东西。”

Crowley drummed his fingers on the table. "I'll eat back home."  
克劳利在桌子上敲着手指。“我会回家吃。”

"Meant to replenish yer essence then, whatever," said Hastur. "Not gonna get into trouble for you chipping that away an' peggin' out." He paused, emptying his bowl. "Oh, an' tell you what. If you some'ow ever end up human through shit like that, yer soul's mine once you bite the dust."  
“既然是为了补充你的精华，随便你了。”哈斯特说道，“我可不会因为你消耗掉它而惹上麻烦，然后死掉。”他停顿了一下，将碗里的东西吃完。“哦，还有，告诉你个事儿。如果你以某种方式变成人类，像那样的话，你的灵魂在你死后就是我的了。”

"You know that's impossible." Crowley glowered again.  
你知道那是不可能的。克劳利再次怒视着。

Hastur shrugged. "Still called dibs."  
哈斯特耸了耸肩。“还是我先说的。”

Crowley, with the speed of a continental drift, lowered his glasses and looked at the senior demon. Three minutes later he had helped himself to some live mice from one of the stalls.  
克劳利慢悠悠地放下眼镜，看着那位高级恶魔。三分钟后，他从一个摊位上拿了几只活老鼠。

"So?" 那又怎样？

Crowley slurped up a tail and cocked his head at Hastur. "_So_?"  
克劳利吮吸了一口尾巴，斜睨着哈斯特尔说道：“怎么样？”

"We good to go then?" He burped briefly, running his sleeve over his mouth.  
我们准备好了吗？他打了个小嗝，用袖子擦了擦嘴巴。

Leaning back inches, Crowley flicked out his tongue, tasting the air. "When was the last time you had a bath. And I mean bath bath."  
克劳利向后倾斜几英寸，伸出舌头舔了舔空气。“你上次洗澡是什么时候？我是说真正的洗澡。”

"August 1928, why d'ye ask?"  
1928年8月，你为什么问这个？

Crowley frowned in defeat. "Whatever else, I..." he drew deep breath. "I'm not gonna let you anywhere near Aziraphale until you have reacqainted yourself with the basics of human hygiene."  
克劳利沮丧地皱起了眉头。“无论如何，我……”他深吸了一口气。“在你重新熟悉人类卫生基本常识之前，我绝不会让你接近亚齐拉费尔。”

"Yah?" Hastur quirked an a- and bemused brow at him. "So, yer flat first?"  
"是吗？" 哈斯特对他挑了挑眉毛，一脸困惑和好奇。 "那么，你是先去你的公寓吗？"

"Unfortunately." 很遗憾。

~⧖~

"I believe I should say 'Make yourself at home'," Aziraphale began, dithering his way through the shop and to the back room, "But I don't know how appropriate that'd be, given..."  
“我相信我应该说‘请随意’，”阿齐拉费尔开始说道，他在店里犹豫不决地走向后面的房间，“但考虑到……我不确定那是否合适。”

The new supervisor waved him off. "Just gimme a drink," he said, slumping down on the sofa with an exhausted sigh. "Can't get a decent drink anywhere."  
新任主管挥了挥手。他说：“给我来杯酒吧。”他疲惫地坐在沙发上，发出一声叹息。“哪里都喝不到好酒。”

"Oh, I'm aware," murmured Aziraphale, picking a bottle of Brandy from the cabinet. "Brandy?"  
“哦，我知道，”阿齐拉费尔低声说着，从橱柜里拿起一瓶白兰地。“白兰地？”

"Won't hurt." 不会伤害。

Aziraphale filled two glasses and put them down on the table between them as he sat down.  
亚齐拉费尔倒满了两杯酒，然后将它们放在他们之间的桌子上，坐了下来。

The other angel downed his drink immediately, wiping his mouth. "I needed that."  
另一个天使立刻喝完了酒，擦了擦嘴巴。“我需要这个。”

"So," Aziraphale tried making polite conversation, "What was your rank again?"  
“那么，”亚齐拉费尔试图进行客套的交谈，“你的军衔是什么来着？”

The other rolled his eyes. "Dominion. Natural supervisor, innit?" he said, flashing Aziraphale a tired smile.  
另一个人翻了个白眼。“主宰。天生的监督者，明白吧？”他说着，向阿齐拉费尔勉强笑了笑。

"Dominion, yes. Well, ah, I understand you asked for this assignment?"  
主权，是的。嗯，啊，我明白你是要求这个任务的吗？

The other blew a raspberry (as did his chameleon). "_Asked_ fer somethin' more excitin' than paper pushing," he said. "Not for... playing nanny for... Ah, forget it."  
另一个人吹了个蔓越莓（他的变色龙也是）。"要求点比填表更刺激的事情，"他说。"不是...当保姆...啊，算了吧。"

"I doubt that that is an option in this situation."  
我怀疑在这种情况下这是一个选择。

"I know." The other kicked off his shoes and reclined on the sofa. "So, we wait now?"  
"我知道。" 另一个人踢掉鞋子，靠在沙发上。"那么，我们现在等待吗？"

"Do we have a choice?" Aziraphale sighed, downing his drink. Then he got up and went for the phone.  
我们有选择吗？阿齐拉费尔叹了口气，喝完了他的饮料。然后他站起身去拿电话。

"Yer callin' the little snake?"  
你在叫那条小蛇吗？

"He has a right to know what..."  
他有权知道...

The other angel got up and took the receiver from Aziraphale. "No. He ain't. But I's got a right to have him be surprised."  
另一个天使站起来，从亚齐拉费尔手中接过话筒。“不，他不在。但我有权让他感到惊讶。”

Aziraphale wrinkled his nose. Then again... "Oh, alright."  
亚齐拉费尔皱了皱鼻子。再想想... "哦，好吧。"

"Good. Now let's finish that bottle."  
好的。现在让我们把那瓶喝完。

~⧖~

Overseeing Hell as Satan's second-in-command was akin to trying to herd cats.  
作为撒旦的副手监督地狱就像是试图赶群猫一样。

Beelzebub couldn't remember who said that once (or what she did with them upon it if anything), but it was an accurate description.  
贝尔芭布无法记起是谁曾经说过这句话（或者她对此做了什么，如果有的话），但这是一个准确的描述。

Right now she'd have preferred herding actual cats, however.  
此刻她更愿意去赶实际的猫，然而。

"Anything?" 什么都可以吗？

Dagon shook her head. 达贡摇了摇头。

Beelzebub looked more done than usual, and leaned against the wall with a frown.  
贝尔塞巴布看起来比平常更加疲惫，皱着眉头靠在墙上。

"It might be time t' get the rest of the Council involved," said Dagon.  
达贡说：“也许是时候让其他委员会成员参与进来了。”

"Do we _have_ to?" Beelzebub groaned.  
"我们必须吗？" 贝尔撒巴嗟叹道。

"It looks urgent. You should." said Belphegor, standing there as if she had been there the entire time.  
贝尔菲戈尔说：“看起来很紧急。你应该去。”她站在那里，仿佛一直都在那里。

Beelzebub and Dagon flinched back.  
别西卜和达贡退缩了一步。

"Lilith's titsz! What did I szay 'bout poppin' up on me like that?"  
"丽莉丝的胸部！我说过什么关于突然冒出来吓我一跳的事情吗？"

"Don't do it?" "不要做吗？"

Beelzebub glowered at the other Archdemon, but ultimately just rolled her eyes.  
贝尔芬格对另一个大恶魔怒视了一眼，但最终只是翻了翻白眼。

"Get us involved in what?" Belphegor bounced on her feet, maybe a little too excitedly.  
"让我们参与什么？" 贝尔菲戈尔兴奋地踮起脚尖，或许有点过于兴奋了。

Beelzebub quirked a brow. "Funny you don't know for onsze," she said.  
贝尔泽布尔皱了皱眉头。“有趣的是，你竟然不知道onsze是什么意思，”她说道。

"So it's not about the surplus demon?"  
那么这不是关于盈余恶魔的问题吗？

Patience was a virtue. So it was out of the question in Hell. And Belphegor was one of those demons that provided excellent training possibilities to never indulge in patience. Beelzebub, however, decided to skip out on training for now.  
耐心是一种美德。所以在地狱里是不可能的。贝尔菲戈尔是那些提供绝佳训练机会以免沉溺于耐心的恶魔之一。然而，贝尔则博决定暂时放弃训练。

"I don't want to know how you know that," she said, "But doesz anyone elsze know?"  
她说：“我不想知道你是怎么知道的，但是还有其他人知道吗？”

"Yes," said Belphegor. “是的，”贝尔菲戈说道。

"Who?" "谁？"

Belphegor pointed at Dagon.  
贝尔菲戈指着达贡。

Beelzebub frowned. "I swear to... I mean aszide from the obviousz."  
贝尔芬格皱了皱眉头。“我发誓……我是说除了显而易见的。”

Belphegor shook her head and picked up a beetle that had crawled from the wilted flowercrown she was wearing. "Oh, lunch!"  
贝尔菲戈尔摇了摇头，捡起了一只从她佩戴的枯萎花冠上爬出来的甲虫。“哦，午餐！”

"Szo?" 嗨，怎么了？

"The surplus demon, whoever it is, ‘cause I know they exist but not who it is, certainly knows," said Belphegor, chewing. "But I know what you mean. Answer's no. Not that I'd know. Well," she pondered and pointed upwards meaningfully. "She prolly knows, but that's it."  
“谁是那个多余的恶魔，我不知道是谁，但我知道他们存在，”贝尔菲戈咀嚼着说道。“但我知道你的意思。答案是否定的。虽然我也不知道。嗯，”她思考了一下，有意义地指了指上方。“她可能知道，但也仅此而已。”

"Yesz, yesz, that'sz an obvious one." Beelzebub sighed deeply, arms akimbo, and turned to Dagon. "Asszemble the Council. Szee that Leviathan isz there and hasn't submerged themself again. I'll speak to the Maszter."  
"是的，是的，这是显而易见的。"贝利泽布深深地叹了口气，双手叉腰，转向达贡说道："召集议会。确保利维坦在场，并且没有再次潜入水中。我将与主人交谈。"

Dagon nodded and headed down the corridor in one direction. Beelzebub went the other.  
达贡点了点头，朝一个方向走下了走廊。贝利泽布则选择了另一个方向。

Belphegor looked around, found herself out of directions, and simply vanished.  
贝尔菲戈尔四处张望，发现自己迷失了方向，然后就消失了。

~⧖~

"At least your human form got rid of a lot of the _Eww_ ," Crowley murmured, fishing for the shampoo.  
克劳利嘀咕着：“至少你的人类形态摆脱了很多恶心的东西。”他摸索着找洗发水。

He was currently kneeling next to his tub, making sure Hastur actually did get clean. Much to their mutual dismay and annoyance.  
他目前正跪在浴缸旁边，确保哈斯特尔真的洗干净了。这让他们彼此感到失望和恼怒。

"Shurrup," Hastur growled, without much enthusiasm.  
"闭嘴，"哈斯特咆哮着，没有太多的热情。

"Can't believe I'm actually washing you like a dog."  
真不敢相信我居然要像洗狗一样给你洗澡。

"Can't believe yer not shuttin' up."  
真不敢相信你一直不停地说个不停。

Crowley rolled his eyes and leaned onto the tub. "I'll be civil. We have to be on the same page here."  
克劳利翻了个白眼，靠在浴缸上。“我会礼貌一点的。我们必须站在同一条战线上。”

Hastur simply submerged himself in response.  
哈斯特尔只是沉浸在自己的回应中。

"I know you can still hear me," said Crowley. "Look, we both agree Hell and Heaven do this shit to punish all of us. You'll probably go and make Aziraphale miserable, and I already hate you extra for that." He sighed. "I don't know if I'll be off better or worse with whatever Heaven will force on me, but..."  
克劳利说：“我知道你还能听到我说的话。听着，我们都同意地狱和天堂都在用这种手段来惩罚我们所有人。你可能会让亚齐拉费尔更加痛苦，我已经因此而对你更加憎恨。”他叹了口气。“我不知道天堂将会强加给我的东西会让我变得更好还是更糟，但是……”

Hastur reached out of the water and put a hand over Crowley's mouth before coming back up. "You talk too much," he said, pulling his hand back and coughing a little. "An’ I can do the whole washin' thing meself."  
Hastur从水中伸出手，捂住了克劳利的嘴巴，然后重新浮出水面。"你说得太多了，"他说着，把手收回来，有些咳嗽了一下。"洗澡的事情我自己能搞定。"

"Maybe. But will you?" 可能。但是你会吗？

Now Hastur shifted and leaned onto the side of the tub, giving Crowley a tired grin. "Fine, fine."  
现在哈斯特尔移动了一下，倚靠在浴缸的一侧，对克劳利露出了疲惫的笑容。“好吧，好吧。”

A bit of scrubbing later, Hastur sat back in the bath again. "Crowley?"  
稍微擦洗了一下，哈斯特尔再次坐回浴缸里。“克劳利？”

Crowley looked up from 'The Book Of Heroic Failures' he was reading. "Yes?"  
克劳利从他正在阅读的《英雄失败录》中抬起头来。“什么事？”

Hastur gazed at him for a moment. And Crowley had to admit to himself, he had never seen the senior demon so focused. And tired.  
哈斯特尔注视着他片刻。克劳利不得不承认，他从未见过这位资深恶魔如此专注。而且疲惫不堪。

"Forget it," said Hastur, and dove to get the soap out of his hair. He lifted his hand out of the water and snapped his fingers, before coming back up. "Good enough fer you?"  
“算了吧。”哈斯特尔说着，俯身去洗掉头上的肥皂。他把手从水里抬出来，咔嗒一声响指，然后重新浮出水面。“够好了吧？”

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"Me clothes." 我的衣服。

Putting the book down, Crowley got up and checked the pile of clothes in the corner. He had planned to chuck them out.  
放下书，克劳利站起身来，检查了角落里的一堆衣服。他原本打算把它们扔掉。

Possibly after setting them on fire first.  
可能是在先点燃它们之后。

Though that would have meant touching them.  
虽然那意味着要触碰到他们。

But now they looked fine. Still far too many layers for Crowley's taste, but Hell could get cold. Especially these days.  
但现在它们看起来不错。对克劳利来说，层数仍然太多，但地狱可能会变冷。尤其是现在这些日子。

He gingerly picked up the shirt and had a look at it. It still looked worn and mangled, but otherwise acceptable. "Yeah, that'll do."  
他小心翼翼地拿起衬衫，仔细看了看。虽然看起来有些破旧和皱巴巴的，但总体还算可以接受。“嗯，这就行了。”

"Then gimme a towel, Fledg-..." Hastur made an undignified noise and bit his lips. "Jus' gimme a towel."  
"那就给我一条毛巾，弗莱德……"哈斯特发出了一声不太体面的声音，咬住了嘴唇。"就给我一条毛巾吧。"

Crowley stood stiff. "What did you just say?"  
克劳利僵硬地站着。“你刚才说什么？”

"Gimme a towel, for Hell's sake," Hastur barked, getting up and out of the bath. Once he was remotely dried off and dressed, he glared at Crowley.  
给我一条毛巾，见鬼的，"哈斯特咆哮着，从浴缸里站起来。等他稍微擦干并穿好衣服后，他怒视着克劳利。

"Now, does this earn yer approval?" he said sarcastically.  
"现在，这样做能得到您的认可吗？"他讽刺地说道。

Crowley harrumphed. "It'll do." He gave a half-hearted but approving nod. "You wait here, I'll ring up Aziraphale."  
克劳利咕哝了一声。“勉强可以。”他略带不情愿地点了点头。“你在这等着，我给阿齐拉费尔打个电话。”

"Could jus' go there, y'know," Hastur called after him.  
“哈斯特尔在他身后喊道：“可以就去那儿，你知道的。”

"No bloody way," Crowley called from the corridor. "I know he knows, but I doubt he knows about you." He slipped into his office and picked up the phone.  
“他妈的不可能！”克劳利在走廊里喊道。“我知道他知道，但我怀疑他知道你的存在。”他走进办公室，拿起电话。

The first time no one picked up. Crowley checked his watch. It was a ridiculous enough hour in the evening for Aziraphale to have the shop open.  
第一次没人接电话。克劳利看了看手表。这个时间对于阿齐拉费尔来说开店实在是太荒谬了。

He waited a minute and tried again. And again Aziraphale didn't pick up.  
他等了一分钟，然后再试了一次。而阿齐拉费尔还是没有接电话。

Crowley let out an annoyed groan and sat down on the desk. Was the angel still stuck in Heaven?  
克劳利不满地哼了一声，坐在桌子上。天使还被困在天堂吗？

Let's hope not. 希望不是这样。

He tried again. 他再次尝试。

At least he tried to try again. But then Hastur was standing in the doorway, tapping his wrist.  
至少他试图再试一次。但是此时哈斯特尔站在门口，敲着他的手腕。

"We'll walk," he said. "I hate your car."  
他说：“我们走路吧，我讨厌你的车。”

Crowley wrinkled his nose dramatically. "Only 'cause you almost got set on fire the last time you were driving with me."  
克劳利夸张地皱了皱鼻子。“只是因为上次你和我一起开车的时候差点被烧着了。”

~⧖~

"Oh, this is truly a work of art," said the woman in red, sipping her coffee. She called herself Ruby these days. She was sitting in a little cafe across a fast food restaurant which had just opened for a Super-Special-Internet-Sensation-Only-Available-For-A-Limited-Time menu item. The brawl that ensued was majestic.  
“哦，这真是一件艺术品。”红衣女子边品味着咖啡边说道。她如今自称为Ruby。她坐在一家小咖啡馆里，对面是一家刚刚开业的快餐店，推出了一款只有在网络上引起超级特别轰动的限时菜单。接下来发生的争吵简直是壮观。

"And all that over something with the nutritional value of a soggy piece of cardboard."  
而这一切都是为了一块营养价值堪比湿纸板的东西。

The man she was meeting with huffed, amused. "Oh, now you insult me," he said. "As if I'd allow for it to get up to that level."  
她要见的那个男人嗤笑了一声，有些好笑地说道：“哦，现在你在侮辱我了，就好像我会允许事情发展到那个程度一样。”

They shared a chuckle. 他们一起笑了起来。

"Now," said the man. He was still going by Sable. "I assume you've heard?"  
“现在，”那个人说道。他仍然使用着Sable这个名字。“我猜你已经听说了吧？”

"About our old friend?" asked Ruby. "Sure."  
"关于我们的老朋友呢？" Ruby 问道。"当然可以。"

"What do you make of that?"  
你对此有何看法？

Ruby shrugged, watching as someone across the street shattered the front door by throwing someone else through it. "Oh, that certainly hurt. And I dunno. Weird to think there'd be five of us."  
Ruby耸了耸肩，看着街对面有人把另一个人扔进前门，将其打碎。“哦，那肯定很疼。我也不知道。想想有五个我们，感觉有点奇怪。”

"Weird to think there'd be two Ends of the World." Sable leaned back, tapping a pencil against his lips in thought.  
"想到世界会有两个尽头，感觉有点奇怪。" Sable 后仰着身子，用铅笔轻轻敲打着嘴唇，陷入沉思。

"What's the matter?" 怎么了？

"I can't say. There is just something off about... the world. For lack of a better phrase," Sable looked at Ruby. "And I don't mean about what happened or didn't happen. Care to accompany me to England?"  
我说不出来。这个世界...总感觉有点不对劲。用更好的说法来说，"Sable看着Ruby说道。"我不是指发生或未发生的事情。愿意陪我去英国吗？"

Ruby rolled her shoulders and looked across the street.  
Ruby挺直了肩膀，朝街对面望去。

"Sure," she said. "America is too easy anyway."  
“当然，”她说道。“美国太容易了。”

They left. 他们走了。

Then the first police cars arrived.  
然后第一辆警车到达了。

~⧖~

They did take the car.  
他们确实拿走了车。

"Still prefer 'orses," Hastur murmured as they got out.  
当他们下车时，哈斯图尔低声说道：“还是更喜欢马。”

"I don't." Crowley slinkied his way next to him at the bookshop's door.  
“我不。”克劳利在书店门口悄悄地靠近他。

"No surprise there. Yer utter shite wi' animals."  
毫不意外。你对动物一窍不通。

Crowley harrumphed, "Excuse you? I'm great with animals. The Almighty made the entirety of Australia for what I came up with." He checked the sign (as expected it said _Closed_ ), but the fact that the lights were on was a relief.  
克劳利咕哝道：“你说什么？我对动物很擅长。全能者为了我而创造了整个澳大利亚。”他检查了标志（果然写着关门），但灯亮着让他松了口气。

The door was, naturally, locked, but Crowley simply let himself in.  
门自然是锁着的，但克劳利毫不犹豫地进去了。

"Aziraphale?" he called. "阿齐拉费尔？" 他喊道。

"Yes?" Aziraphale called down from the back, ultimately coming to the front of the shop with a stack of books. "Oh."  
"什么事？"阿齐拉费尔从后面喊道，最终拿着一堆书走到店前。“哦。”

He put the books down on the counter and looked at the two demons.  
他把书放在柜台上，看着那两个恶魔。

"I tried calling you," said Crowley.  
克劳利说：“我试着给你打电话。”

"Oh, I was quite busy," said Aziraphale, hands behind his back. Crowley craned his neck a little, wondering mildly if the angel was currently crossing his fingers.  
“哦，我挺忙的。”阿齐拉费尔说着，双手放在背后。克劳利稍微伸长了脖子，好奇地想知道天使是否正在交叉手指。

"Were you?" he inquired. "你是吗？" 他询问道。

"Yes," said Aziraphale, looking mortally offended. "I have recently acquired a stack of the most..."  
“是的，”阿齐拉费尔生气地说道。“我最近得到了一堆最……”

Crowley raised his hand. That was all he needed to know to be certain the angel was truthful.  
克劳利举起了手。这就足够让他确信天使是真实的。

"Alright," he said, and gestured at Hastur, who was checking some of the titles by the window. "Well, you've met Hastur by now." Aziraphale took off and pocketed his glasses.  
"好的，"他说着，示意着正在窗边检查一些书名的哈斯图尔。"嗯，你现在已经见过哈斯图尔了。"亚齐拉费尔摘下并收好了眼镜。

"Yes. I was about to ask why he's accompanying you. Oh." Understanding made itself comfortable in the angel's face. "I presume he..."  
是的。我正要问为什么他陪着你。哦。理解在天使的脸上显得自在。“我猜他...”

"Yeah, he's to... keep an eye on you." Crowley frowned, jabbing a thumb at Hastur. "I'll be getting one of yours, right?"  
“是的，他会……盯着你。”克劳利皱了皱眉头，用拇指指向哈斯特尔。“我会得到你们中的一个，对吧？”

"Well, yes." Aziraphale wrung his hands in slight distress. "I... guess."  
"嗯，是的。"阿齐拉费尔有些不安地揉着双手说道。“我...猜是吧。”

Crowley looked at him over the rim of his glasses. "You guess? You knew 'bout this chaperone business before I did. How can you not know whom I'll be getting?"  
克劳利透过眼镜边缘看着他。“你猜？你早就知道这个监护人的事情了。你怎么可能不知道我会得到谁？”

"It's..." Aziraphale smacked his lips in thought, "complicated, I'd say."  
“这个……”亚齐拉费尔思考着，咂了咂嘴，“我会说，有点复杂。”

"Complicated?" "复杂吗？"

Aziraphale sighed. "I mean. Yes, yes. You will be getting an angel as supervisor. It has just gotten a little..." another heavy sigh followed. "Oh, I guess it will be easiest if we stop stalling, and you see this for yourself. Wait here, please, I'll get him."  
亚齐拉费尔叹了口气。“我的意思是，是的，是的。你将会得到一个天使作为监督。只是有点……”又是一声沉重的叹息。“哦，我想最好我们别再拖延了，你自己看看吧。请在这里等一下，我去找他。”

Crowley and Hastur watched the angel leave, both feeling quite a bit at out of their wits. Which was, frankly, their status quo sentiment for the last several hours.  
克劳利和哈斯特看着天使离开，两人都感到有些失魂落魄。坦白说，这已经是他们过去几个小时一直持续的状态。

Aziraphale returned, and with him the appointed heavenly supervisor.  
亚齐拉费尔回来了，与他一起回来的是被指派的天堂监督。

Who looked from Crowley to Hastur and back, drew a deep breath and....  
谁从克劳利看向哈斯特尔，然后又回过头来，深吸了一口气，然后……

"Just how bloody holy _was_ that water?"  
那水到底有多神圣？

The silence they stood in was getting more awkward by the second. At some point Aziraphale stealthily gestured to Crowley inquiring whether or not he should make tea.  
他们站着的沉默变得越来越尴尬。在某个时刻，亚齐拉费尔偷偷向克劳利示意，询问是否应该泡茶。

Crowley, not as stealthily on account that he was hiding behind Hastur now, gestured back to wait.  
克劳利并不像之前那样悄无声息地藏在哈斯特尔身后，他示意后退等待。

Well, that was Ligur. 嗯，那就是利古尔。

No mistake there. 没有错误。

He was an angel. 他是一个天使。

No mistake there either. 没有错误。

Which proves that, occasionally, God introduces dice into the ineffable game of poker.  
这证明，偶尔上帝会在难以言喻的扑克游戏中引入骰子。

"Well," Hastur finally broke the silence after another round of staring. "One o'us will have t'say 'You've changed' first or we'll be here all day."  
“嗯，”哈斯特在又一轮凝视后终于打破了沉默。“我们中的一个得先说‘你变了’，要不然我们会在这里待上一整天。”

"Guess so," Ligur said soberly. "You... I like what you did wi' yer hair."  
"猜对了，"利格尔冷静地说道。"你...我喜欢你把头发弄成那样。"

"Oh, piss off," Hastur groaned, but his mouth twitched into a grin. "They... How..." he gestured at the chameleon.  
"哦，滚开吧，"哈斯特嘟囔着，但他的嘴角却扬起了一丝笑容。"他们...怎么..."他指了指变色龙。

"Y'know Her sense o' humor," said Ligur, pointing up meaningfully.  
“你知道她的幽默感，”利格尔指着上方有意味地说道。

"Yah, never liked that." 嗯，从来就不喜欢那个。

Crowley rocked on his heels, still shuffling behind Hastur.  
克劳利在脚后跟上晃动着，仍然跟在哈斯特尔的后面蹒跚前行。

Ligur leaned to the side. "I knows yer there, y'know."  
利古尔向一侧倾斜了一下。“我知道你在那儿，你知道的。”

Crowley peeked around the taller demon. "Excuse you, I'm having an existential crisis here."  
克劳利从更高的恶魔身后偷偷瞥了一眼。“不好意思，我正在经历一场存在危机。”

Ligur smiled, pleased. "Good."  
利古尔微笑着，满意地说道：“很好。”

"Aziraphale, could we talk for a moment?" said Crowley, curling his fingers into Hastur's waistcoat as if holding on for dear life. "Alone?"  
"亚齐拉费尔，我们能谈一会儿吗？" 克劳利说着，紧紧抓住哈斯特的背心，仿佛紧紧抓住最后的希望。"单独一会儿？"

Aziraphale looked at Hastur and Ligur (especially Ligur), and nodded as the newly-fangled angel stepped aside.  
亚齐拉费尔看着哈斯特和利古（尤其是利古），点了点头，然后那位新近加入的天使退到了一旁。

Crowley still made sure to keep the biggest possible distance to the former demon as he followed Aziraphale into the back of the shop.  
克劳利仍然确保与这位前恶魔保持尽可能大的距离，跟随阿齐拉费尔进入店铺的后面。

"I'd like a supervisor who won't kill me in my sleep," Crowley hissed in a stage whisper.  
“我想要一个不会在我睡觉时杀了我的主管。”克劳利用舞台式的低声嘶吼说道。

"You don't need to sleep," said Aziraphale. "And I'm certain he won't." Crowley wasn't convinced.  
“你不需要睡觉。”亚齐拉费尔说道。“而且我确定他也不会。”克劳利并不相信。

"Aziraphale, do you... do you know who that is?"  
亚齐拉费尔，你...你知道那是谁吗？

"Yes. You've told me. And so did he."🔄  ❓

Crowley made a distressed noise.  
克劳利发出了一声痛苦的噪音。

"Aziraphale," he wailed, going syllable by syllable. "This is bad. This is really bad. Hastur was bad enough news. But Ligur? We're screwed. Me more than you. He's... he's an angel. He could, he could... he could bless my coffee."  
“阿齐拉费尔，”他哀嚎着，一字一音地说道。“这不妙。真的很不妙。哈斯特已经是个坏消息了。但是利古尔呢？我们完蛋了。我比你更完蛋。他是...他是个天使。他可以，他可以...他可以给我的咖啡祝福。”

"No, he couldn't," said Aziraphale. "Coffee is your lot’s, remember?"  
“不，他不能喝咖啡，”亚齐拉费尔说道。“咖啡是你们这些人的，记得吗？”

"Aziraphale," Crowley wailed a little more desperately. The angel, however, just smiled calmly.  
"阿齐拉费尔，" 克劳利有些绝望地哀嚎着。然而，天使只是平静地微笑着。

"Crowley, I have talked to him for most of the time he's been here. Trust me, he is as unhappy with this as you."  
克劳利，我和他交谈了大部分时间他在这里的时候。相信我，他和你一样对此感到不满。

"Yeah," came a voice from the archway separating this part of the shop from the front. It was Ligur. "Can't kill you. Ain't even allowed to make you mis'rable," he grunted, glaring daggers.  
“是的，”从将店铺的这一部分与前面隔开的拱门处传来了一个声音。那是利格尔。“不能杀了你。甚至不允许让你痛苦，”他咕哝着，怒视着对方。

Crowley regained some posture.  
克劳利恢复了一些姿态。

"Oh?" "哦？"

"This is punishment for all four of us, Crowley," said Aziraphale. "And I think Ligur here has it the worst."  
“这是对我们四个人的惩罚，克劳利，”阿齐拉费尔说道。“我觉得利古尔在这里受的罚最严重。”

"How?" Crowley cried out, sounding positively offended.  
“怎么回事？”克劳利大声喊道，听起来非常生气。

Ligur let out a small snarl. Hastur picked up the explaining duty.  
利古尔发出了一声小小的咆哮。哈斯特接过了解释的责任。

"Just learned that if we mess this up, we're goners," he said.  
他说：“刚刚得知，如果我们搞砸了，我们就完蛋了。”

"What?" Crowley shook himself.  
“什么？”克劳利摇了摇头。

"Hell didn't tell you?" asked Aziraphale. Then he frowned. "Of course they didn't. It's Hell."  
“地狱没告诉你吗？”亚齐拉费尔问道。然后他皱了皱眉。“当然他们没告诉你。这是地狱。”

"Any bit o' revenge-y stuff that goes b'yond mild inconveniences," said Ligur, "And we're in for..." he drew a deep breath.  
“只要是超出了轻微困扰的报复行为，”利格尔说道，“我们就会陷入……”他深吸了一口气。

"It would be worse," Aziraphale stated dryly. Crowley just nodded.  
“情况会更糟的，”亚齐拉费尔干巴巴地说道。克劳利只是点了点头。

This was so typically Hell.  
这真是典型的地狱。

"So, no killing, no destruction of property, no intentional getting the other into trouble," Aziraphale continued. "In fact, Heaven gave us a full list."  
“所以，不杀人，不破坏财产，不故意让对方陷入麻烦。”亚齐拉费尔继续说道。“事实上，天堂给了我们一份完整的清单。”

"Three guesses what Hell did," Crowley snarled softly. "First two don't count."  
克劳利低声咆哮道：“猜猜地狱做了什么，三次机会，前两次不算。”

"I shall, of course, give you the list," said Aziraphale.  
“当然，我会给你清单的。”亚齐拉费尔说道。

"We," Ligur interrupted, gesturing at himself and Hastur, "also got a few things to talk 'bout... Alone... What's the next pub?"  
“我们，”利古尔打断道，指着自己和哈斯特，“也有一些事情要谈论...独自...下一个酒吧在哪里？”

"Err, there's the Coach & Horses," said Aziraphale.  
“嗯，那边就是‘教练与马匹’酒吧，”阿齐拉费尔说道。

"Oh, I knows that one." Hastur beamed. "We'll be seein' you. Dun try to run."  
"哦，我知道那个人。"哈斯特欣喜地说道。"我们会再见的，别想逃跑。"

He practically dragged Ligur out of the shop.  
他几乎把利古尔从店里拽了出来。

Crowley looked after them. "Isn't the Coach & Horses a nudist vegan thing pub?"  
克劳利照顾着他们。“教练与马匹酒吧不是一个裸体主义者素食主义者的地方吗？”

"I believe Hastur's fully aware."  
我相信哈斯特尔完全明白。

Outside, Hastur drew a deep breath of night air and laid his head back as he and Ligur walked down the street.  
在外面，哈斯特深吸了一口夜空的空气，然后和利古尔一起沿着街道走着，他把头仰靠在后面。

"You gonna start?" he said after a bit.  
过了一会儿，他说道：“你准备好了吗？”

"Seems to be gnawing on y'more. You start."  
似乎在啃你的份儿。你先开始。

Hastur frowned softly. 哈斯特轻轻皱了皱眉。

"I... I thought I'd never...," he began, but fell silent and slowed down.  
"我...我以为我永远都不会...," 他开始说，但是他沉默下来，放慢了脚步。

"What's wrong?" asked Ligur.  
"怎么了？" Ligur 问道。

Hastur stopped. A moment later Beelzebub stepped into his path.  
哈斯特停下来。片刻后，贝利泽布步入他的面前。

"Duke Hasztur" she said, and Hastur gave an acknowledging nod and slight bow. "I muszt..." Then she spotted Ligur, and took a step back in surprise. "But... Duke Ligur?"  
“哈斯图公爵。”她说道，哈斯图微微点头，轻轻鞠了一躬。“我必须……”然后她看到了利古尔，惊讶地后退了一步。“但是……利古尔公爵？”

"I wish," said Ligur with a wistful sneer. "'S 'Dominion' now."  
“我希望，”利格尔带着一丝渴望的冷笑说道。“现在是‘主权’。”

"You..." Beelzebub looked him up and down while the passersby flowed around them. "You're with the opposition? But... how?"  
“你……”贝尔撒巴看着他上下打量，周围的行人在他们身边流动。“你是反对派的人？可是……怎么可能？”

Ligur shrugged. "God knows."  
利古尔耸耸肩。“只有上帝知道。”

"An' as usual She ain't tellin'," Hastur finished.  
“一如既往，她又没说。”哈斯特结束了。

Beelzebub let out an exhausted groan.  
贝尔塞巴布发出一声疲惫的呻吟。

"Right, not me business anymore," said Ligur and stepped past the Archdemon. He briefly looked back, "I'll get our drinks."  
“好吧，不关我事了。”Ligur说着，走过大恶魔。他稍微回头看了一眼，“我去拿我们的饮料。”

Once he had slipped into the pub, Beelzebub turned back to Hastur.  
当他悄悄溜进酒吧后，贝利泽布回头看着哈斯特尔。

"You left your poszt," she said. "But I can szee why. You are excuszed."  
她说：“你离开了你的职位，但我能理解为什么。你被免职了。”

Hastur nodded stoically. 哈斯特坚定地点了点头。

"Why're you here?" he said, burying his hands in his pockets.  
他把双手插进口袋，问道：“你怎么来了？”

"There'sz a problem," said Beelzebub. "And we want you to look into it."  
“有个问题，”贝利泽布说道。“我们希望你去调查一下。”

"Problem?" 有问题吗？

Beelzebub told Hastur about the surplus demon.  
贝尔芬格告诉哈斯特尔关于多余的恶魔。

"Keep your eyesz open," she finished. Then she looked over to the pub. "And not..."  
"保持眼睛睁开，"她说完。然后她看向酒吧。"而且不要..."

"...a word. Figures." 一个字。数字。

"Report back asz scheduled." With a buzzing sound Beelzebub was gone.  
按计划回报。随着嗡嗡声，贝利泽布消失了。

Hastur sighed, cracked his neck, and ducked into the pub.  
哈斯特叹了口气，扭了扭脖子，然后闪身进了酒吧。

"What was that all 'bout?" said Ligur as Hastur sat down in the booth with him.  
“刚才那是怎么回事？”Ligur问道，当Hastur坐在他旁边的包厢里。

"Can't tell you. Yer an angel," Hastur answered, taking the glass Ligur had gotten for him. "Cheers."  
"告诉不了你。你是个天使，" 哈斯特回答道，拿起了利古尔为他准备的玻璃杯。“干杯。”

"Fair 'nough. Cheers." 好的，没问题。干杯。

They drank. 他们喝了。

"Hell's got a surplus demon I oughta look out for," Hastur said casually, and Ligur nearly choked on his drink.  
“地狱多了个多余的恶魔，我得小心点。”哈斯特随意地说道，利古几乎被自己的饮料呛住了。

"...what?" Ligur spluttered.  
“……什么？”利古尔结结巴巴地说道。

"Extra demon back ho-... Downstairs. No one knows wot's goin' on."  
额外的恶魔回来了...楼下。没人知道发生了什么事。

"Weren't you supposed to not tell me?"  
你不是应该不告诉我吗？

"An' pass up on the chance t' get such a reaction out of'n angel?" Hastur smirked, black eyes flashing with amusement. "Naw."  
“放弃让一个天使做出如此反应的机会？”哈斯特嘿嘿一笑，黑眼睛闪烁着愉悦。“不可能。”

~⧖~

**Hell (Under Construction) - 4004 BC  
地狱（建设中）- 公元前4004年**

The not-anymore-angel spluttered, clawing at the rocks, trying to pull themself out of the pool of... was that sulphur? In any case it hurt. Not as much as the fall from Heaven, not as much as a bit of their essence being burned away.  
那个曾经的天使在岩石上挣扎着，试图从那个...是硫磺吗？无论如何，那很痛。虽然没有从天堂坠落那么痛，也没有失去一部分本质那么痛。

Still. 依然。

C'mon, they thought desperately. Their legs felt numb and they had trouble moving them at all.  
快点，他们绝望地想着。他们的腿感到麻木，几乎无法移动。

They gave a cry of despair, when something... someone grabbed them, hauling them out of the pool.  
当某物...某人抓住他们，将他们从池塘中拖出时，他们发出了绝望的呼喊声。

They coughed, rolling onto their back.  
他们咳嗽着，翻身躺在背上。

Big mistake. 大错误。

They cried out as pain shot through their mangled and seared wings, and they rolled back onto their side.  
他们因为剧痛而大声呼喊，翅膀被撕裂和烧焦，他们翻滚着倒在一边。

"That won't do," a voice said. They looked up. Next to them knelt another not-anymore-angel. The other looked as mangled as they felt.  
“不行。”一个声音说道。他们抬起头，旁边跪着另一个不再是天使的存在。那个人看起来和他们感觉一样破碎不堪。

"You're quite late," said the other. "We thought they were through with kicking everyone out."  
"你来得挺晚的，"另一个人说道。"我们以为他们已经把每个人都踢出去了。"

They chuckled bitterly. "I didn't mean to... I asked questions. The Almighty didn't like that."  
他们苦笑着说道：“我不是故意的……我只是问了些问题。全能者不喜欢这样。”

The other nodded, and frowned.  
另一个点了点头，皱了皱眉。

"Where are we?" they asked.  
他们问道：“我们在哪里？”

"Lucifer's calling it 'Hell'," said the other.  
另一个人说：“路西法称之为‘地狱’。”

They nodded. Somehow that sounded right. Then the other lifted them over their shoulder.  
他们点了点头。不知怎么的，那听起来很对。然后另一个人把他们背在肩膀上。

"Wha-?" "什么？"

"If you want to stay alive, you ought to get away from here," said the other. "Others are out hunting for food."  
“如果你想活下去，你应该离开这里，”另一个人说道。“其他人正在外面寻找食物。”

"But... wait, they're eating other... whatever we are now?"  
但是...等等，他们在吃其他...无论我们现在是什么？

"Those that don't get back up fast enough, yes."  
那些没有及时站起来的人，是的。

They cringed. 他们退缩了。

"Um... why are you helping me?"  
嗯...你为什么要帮助我？

The other shrugged their free shoulder. "Beats me. I know I shouldn't."  
另一个人耸了耸无拘束的肩膀。“我也不知道。我知道我不应该。”

They let themself get carried by the other.  
他们让自己被别人牵着走。

"What's your name?" they asked.  
他们问道："你叫什么名字？"

The other grunted. "We don't have names anymore. Just one of the things the Almighty took away."  
另一个人咕哝着说道：“我们不再有名字了。这只是全能者夺走的其中一件事情。”

They winced. "What..." they ventured, "has been your name?"  
他们皱了皱眉。“你的名字是什么？”他们试探着问道。

The other gave a guttural growl. "Don't make me throw you back into the boiling sulphur. Just call me Hastur, if you have to. Could as well ask you what your name's been."  
另一个发出了一声喉咙低吼。“别逼我把你扔回沸腾的硫磺中去。如果你非要称呼我，就叫我哈斯特吧。顺便问一下，你叫什么名字？”

"I'd actually tell you," they said.  
他们说：“实际上我会告诉你。”

Hastur snorted. 哈斯特嗤笑了一声。

"Fine. Humor me, Fledgling."  
好的。逗逗我吧，新手。

"...Keruvael..." "...克鲁瓦尔..."

This is how it went.  
事情就是这样发生的。

Right? 对吧？

~⧖~

**Purgatory - 7** **th** **Sunday after the failed Armageddon**  
炼狱-失败的末日审判后的第七个星期天

Purgatory was, these days, akin to a multistory shopping center\* just before closing time on its upper levels and an abandoned, overgrown one on the lower. It's always dusk here, always hazy and cold. On the upper levels shadows flit back and forth in the corner of one's eyes, the hallways echo sounds with no visible source.  
炼狱如今就像是一个快要关门的多层购物中心，上层人影匆匆，下层则荒废且长满杂草。这里永远是黄昏，永远是朦胧而寒冷的。在上层，阴影在眼角飞快闪动，走廊回荡着无法寻找到来源的声音。

Human souls try to earn\*\* their way into Heaven here.  
人的灵魂在这里努力争取进入天堂。

\*Not exactly what Americans would call a 'mall'. For starters, the food's better in Purgatory.  
并不完全是美国人所称的“购物中心”。首先，在炼狱里的食物更好。

\*\*By working in Purgatory's retail. Which, given the only customers are angels, makes retail on Earth feel like Heaven.\*\*\*  
在炼狱的零售业工作。考虑到唯一的顾客都是天使，这让地球上的零售业感觉像天堂一样。

\*\*\*Humans' idea of Heaven.  
人类对天堂的想象。

On the lower levels pipes have burst, the tiles are cracked and vegetation has slithered in. The lights are flickering and the moldy wallpaper is hanging off the walls in stripes.  
在较低的楼层，管道破裂，瓷砖破裂，植物蔓延进来。灯光闪烁，发霉的墙纸呈条纹状脱落。

It's Hell with a better paint job.  
这就是个外表好看的地狱。

Demons occasionally go scavenging for Heaven's old and thrown out equipment here.  
恶魔偶尔会在这里搜寻天堂旧的和被丢弃的设备。

Down where the shadows are the darkest, a figure, wiry and inhuman, staggered through the puddles, leaving dark smears where it leaned against the wall for support, dragging itself further and further away from the passage to Hell.  
在阴影最深处，一个瘦弱而非人的身影蹒跚地穿过水坑，每当它倚靠墙壁寻求支撑时，都会留下黑色的污迹，它不断地向远离通往地狱的通道拖拽着自己。

What happens when one dies here?  
在这里，一个人死后会发生什么？

What happens when a _demon_ dies here?  
在这里，当一个恶魔死亡时会发生什么？

The figure stopped. It didn't want to be the one to find out.  
那个人停下了脚步。它不想成为那个发现真相的人。

Maybe if it had been thinking straight it would have just died. Would not have latched onto that tiny thought that danced around its brain.  
也许如果它当时头脑清醒，它就会选择死去。不会执着于那个在它脑海中飘荡的微小念头。

But it was scared, and hurt, and... angry. A form of anger it had felt only once before in its life. A long, long time ago.  
但它感到害怕、受伤，还有...愤怒。一种愤怒，它在生命中只有一次经历过。很久很久以前的事了。

And something in it... changed.  
而其中的某些东西……发生了变化。

A ruffle of feathers, and a scream of pain and agony that faded into broken coughs and sobs.  
一阵羽毛的颤动，伴随着一声痛苦和苦楚的尖叫，渐渐转为断断续续的咳嗽和啜泣声。

Was this wise? 这样做明智吗？

Spending this much energy on...  
在这么多的精力上花费...

Hastur looked at his arm.  
哈斯特尔看着自己的手臂。

He didn't expect the broken bones to mend or the deep gashes to close. But now, for the first time in weeks it felt as if they could.  
他没想到骨折会愈合，深切的伤口会合拢。但现在，几个星期过去了，他第一次感觉到它们似乎可以愈合。

Human forms are supposed to be so feeble and fragile... so...  
人类的形态应该是如此脆弱和脆弱...所以...

And yet... 然而...

He frowned. 他皱了皱眉。

This was absolutely God's sense of humor.  
这绝对是上帝的幽默感。

He had never liked that.  
他从来不喜欢那个。

But if this is how this bloody game is played, he could play too.  
但如果这就是这个该死的游戏的规则，他也可以玩。

He leaned back against the wall, folded his hands...  
他靠在墙上，双手交叉放在胸前...

...and prayed. ...并祈祷。

~⧖~

**London - Now🔄  ❓**

"We could and we should," said Crowley, stalking back and forth in the back room.  
克劳利在后房来回踱步，说道：“我们本可以，也应该这样做。”

"We can't and we shan't," insisted Aziraphale.  
“我们不能也不会这样做。”阿齐拉费尔坚持道。

"Look, I'm not even asking for Alpha Centauri, angel. I just... I just..."  
看，天使，我甚至不要求阿尔法半人马星。我只是...我只是...

Crowley didn't even know what it was he was 'justing'. He was still going through a minor existential crisis. He waved Heaven's list around.  
克劳利甚至不知道他正在“justing”什么。他仍然陷入了一场轻微的存在危机。他挥舞着天堂的名单。

"This is... ridiculous," he finally said.  
"这太...荒谬了，"他最终说道。

"You have already said that five minutes ago," said Aziraphale, who was getting quite worried for the state of both Crowley and his floorboards.  
“你刚刚已经说过了，五分钟前。”亚齐拉费尔说道，他对克劳利和地板的状态感到非常担心。

"The list hasn't changed in the past five minutes, has it?" Crowley stopped, held up the corpus delicti and gazed at it meaningfully. "Nope, not a single letter different," he finally said.  
这个列表在过去的五分钟里没有变化，对吧？克劳利停下来，举起罪证物并有意义地凝视着它。“嗯，没有一个字母不同，”他最终说道。

"Crowley, you are not thinking clearly."  
克劳利，你现在头脑不清醒。

Crowley bristled. 克劳利怒气冲冲。

"How... how can you still be so calm?" he asked, and then his face fell. Finally, a single little thought had made it through the very unpleasant scenarios his brain had come up with. Sometimes, having imagination was a right bugger.  
"你...你怎么还能这么冷静？" 他问道，然后他的脸色变得沮丧。最终，一个小小的念头穿过了他的大脑构想出的非常不愉快的情景。有时候，拥有想象力真是个麻烦事。

His face softened and he crouched down in front of Aziraphale, looking up at the angel's face.  
他的脸变得柔和，他蹲在亚齐拉费尔面前，抬头看着天使的脸。

"You... you've given up?" he whispered worriedly.  
"你...你放弃了吗？" 他担心地低声说道。

Aziraphale blinked at him.  
亚齐拉费尔瞪大眼睛看着他。

Once. 一次。

Twice. 两次。

And smiled kindly, laying a gentle hand on the side of Crowley's neck. "No, dear." He took a deep breath and sat back. "It's just...."  
微笑着亲切地，轻轻地抚摸了一下克劳利的脖子。“不，亲爱的。”他深吸了一口气，靠在椅背上。“只是……”

Crowley cocked his head. 克劳利歪了一下头。

"Just what?" "什么？"

"Oh, I really don't know how to tell you this, that's the issue." Aziraphale, abashed, looked away.  
哦，我真的不知道该怎么告诉你，这就是问题所在。”阿齐拉费尔尴尬地移开了目光。

And Crowley rose. "Tell me what? What... Aziraphale, we’ve known each other for 6000 years and we stopped the... an Apocalypse together. What in... Hieronymus Bosch's name is it that _you_ can't tell me?"  
克劳利站起身来。“告诉我什么？什么...亚齐拉费尔，我们已经相识了6000年，我们一起阻止了...一场启示录。你到底有什么不能告诉我的事情，用...荷罗尼穆斯·博斯的名字来形容它是什么？”

Aziraphale drew a deep breath.  
亚齐拉费尔深吸了一口气。

Then he let it go, got up, and retrieved a bottle of wine and two glasses from the cabinet.  
然后他放开了它，站起来从橱柜里拿出一瓶酒和两个玻璃杯。

"I believe we might need alcohol for this," he said, pouring each of them a glass.  
他说：“我觉得我们可能需要酒来应付这个。”他给每个人倒了一杯。

"You. Are not helping," said Crowley, pointedly, draping himself over the sofa dramatically.  
克劳利指着对方说道：“你，一点都没帮上忙。”他夸张地倒在沙发上。

"Crowley, really." That one had hurt. "I just don't know how to put this."  
克劳利，真的吗。那一句话真的伤到了。我只是不知道该如何说出口。

"Try me." 试试看我。

"I worked with Ligur before and I trust him," said Aziraphale, matter-of-what-the-factly.  
“我之前和Ligur合作过，我信任他。”Aziraphale毫不客气地说道。

Crowley sat up, and stared blankly at the angel.  
克劳利坐了起来，茫然地盯着天使。

"Uh-huh," he said. "嗯嗯，" 他说道。

Aziraphale knew that tone. It was the _Crowley.exe has stopped working_ tone.  
亚齐拉费尔熟悉那种语气。那是克劳利.exe已停止运行的语气。

"I got to know him as a most peculiar, but becoming, refined gentleman back in 1888," Aziraphale thus soldiered on. "You were taking your outrageous nap, as I remember, and it occurred that Hell had made a grave mistake concerning a deal of theirs. As you were unavailable, obviously, Hell then had to send Ligur out to see about setting the record straight. Now, Heaven had gotten the faintest idea of this mishap and thus tasked me with looking into it, and, if possible, save the mortal soul in question. We naturally crossed paths and called a truce, which seemed the wisest thing to do. Especially since it had turned out we were after Jack the Ripper. Now, I don't want to go into detail, but it began in September of 1888, about a week after the horrifying death of Annie Chapman..."  
"我在1888年认识了他，他是一个非常奇特但又很有魅力的绅士，"阿齐拉费尔坚定地说道。"我记得你当时正在做你那出格的午睡，而地狱在一笔交易中犯了一个严重的错误。由于你不在，地狱只好派利古尔出去纠正错误。天堂得知了这个意外，便派我去调查，并尽可能地拯救那个凡人的灵魂。我们自然而然地相遇并达成了停战协议，这似乎是最明智的做法。尤其是因为我们追踪的目标竟然是开膛手杰克。现在，我不想详细说明，但这一切始于1888年的9月，在安妮·查普曼可怕的死亡约一周后..."

Aziraphale went into a detailed account of what had happened, Crowley staring at him blankly the entire time.  
亚齐拉费尔详细叙述了发生的事情，克劳利整个时间都呆呆地盯着他。

"...and that was that then," Aziraphale concluded.  
“就这样吧。”亚齐拉费尔总结道。

Crowley, who had nodded along, rolled his shoulders.  
克劳利点了点头，然后转动了一下肩膀。

"Did you just call Ligur a 'becoming, refined gentleman'?" he asked.  
他问道：“你刚才是不是称呼Ligur为‘一个渐入佳境、优雅绅士’？”

"Yer jus' jealous, you bloody wanker," came a voice from the archway, and Ligur trudged in, followed closely by Hastur. "Can we go then?" he asked, while Hastur slumped down on the sofa next to Crowley.  
“你就是嫉妒，你这个该死的混蛋。”一个声音从拱门处传来，利古尔沉重地走进来，哈斯特尔紧随其后。“我们可以走了吗？”他问道，而哈斯特尔则在克劳利旁边的沙发上瘫坐下来。

"Certainly _can,_" said Crowley, finding himself in a position that allowed for no direction to move in order to edge away from Hastur and Ligur, unless he hurled himself backwards over the sofa. "But _want_?"  
“当然可以。”克劳利说道，他发现自己处于一个无法移动的位置，除非他向后跃过沙发才能躲开哈斯特和利格尔。“但是想要什么呢？”

Ligur frowned. 利古尔皱了皱眉头。

"Which part of 'Can't kill you' didn't you get?"  
"你哪部分听不懂『不能杀你』？"

Crowley frowned back, and looked at Aziraphale.  
克劳利皱起了眉头，然后看着阿齐拉费尔。

"Well, I guess it won't do if we spend the rest of eternity just sitting here," said Aziraphale.  
“嗯，我猜我们不能永远就这样坐在这里了。”亚齐拉费尔说道。

"’M s’pposed to report back to Gabriel once I’ve settled in," said Ligur. "You know'im."  
“我安顿下来后应该向加百列汇报，”利古尔说道。“你知道他的。”

Aziraphale groaned in sympathy, and Crowley got up.  
亚齐拉费尔同情地呻吟了一声，克劳利站了起来。

"Fine, fine," he grumbled, stalking as stiffly as he could towards the door.  
"好了，好了，" 他抱怨着，尽可能僵硬地朝门口走去。

"We're off to a great start..." murmured Aziraphale as the bell above the door signaled their exit. Then he turned to Hastur. "Now, I believe we have to..."  
“我们开始得很顺利…” Aziraphale低声说道，当门上方的铃声响起，标志着他们的离开。然后他转向Hastur。“现在，我相信我们必须…”

Hastur waved him off, draping himself over the sofa dramatically.  
哈斯特挥了挥手，戏剧性地躺在沙发上。

"I knows what yer going t'say. Contrary to Crowley's conviction, I can be civil an' behave. Jus' give me somethin' to do wi' me hands an' we should get along."  
我知道你要说什么。与克劳利的信念相反，我可以礼貌并且表现得得体。只要给我点事情做，我就能和你相处得好。

Aziraphale looked down at him.  
亚齐拉费尔俯视着他。

"If you are talking about letting you harm or destroy..."  
如果你在谈论让你伤害或摧毁的话...

"On the contrary, Principality," Hastur tutted. "Was thinkin' about tinkering."  
相反的是，亲王，哈斯特嘴里咂了咂舌头。“在考虑着动手修修补补。”

"Tinkering?" That was surprising, to say the least.  
“修修补补？” 这真是令人惊讶，至少可以这么说。

"Torture's out of the question, I thought."  
我觉得折磨是不可行的。

Miss Mag was brooding in her little kitchen.  
麦格小姐正愁眉苦脸地坐在她的小厨房里。

It was small and cozy and _picturesque_ even, and if one would not have known, one could have easily mistaken the wooden box on the table for having been part of the kitchen since the kitchen had been built.  
它很小而舒适，甚至可以说是风景如画的，如果一个人不知道的话，很容易会误以为桌子上的木盒子是厨房建成后的一部分。

Miss Mag didn't know what to make of it.  
玛格小姐不知道该怎么处理这件事。

She had come back home from taking a walk, and had just been fishing the key from her pocket when a delivery van had rolled to a stop at the gate. She had not been expecting anything and there had been no return address. But she could rule out a prank and the very old looking package had been addressed to her proper and correct.  
她从散步回到家，刚从口袋里掏出钥匙，一辆送货车就停在了大门口。她并没有期待任何东西，也没有退回地址。但她可以排除恶作剧的可能性，这个看起来非常古老的包裹确实是寄给她的。

Inside it had been an antique wooden box without any decoration except for the very, very sturdy metal parts, and an iron key.  
里面是一个古老的木盒子，除了非常坚固的金属部件和一把铁钥匙外，没有任何装饰。

Miss Mag wasn't certain who'd send her something like that.  
玛格小姐不确定是谁会给她寄这样的东西。

But finally excitement had not managed to avoid her.  
但最终兴奋还是无法避免她的心头。

"Now, what secrets do you hold?" she murmured, turning the box in her hands carefully. Something shifted inside, something that filled the entire box by the sound of it.  
“现在，你隐藏着什么秘密？”她低声说着，小心地转动着手中的盒子。里面有些东西在移动，听起来似乎填满了整个盒子。

With a deep breath and a massive amount of anticipation Mag slid the key into the hole, turned it... And still made a surprised noise when the box clicked open.  
深吸一口气，满怀期待的马格将钥匙插入孔中，转动...当盒子发出咔嗒声打开时，他仍然发出惊讶的声音。

In it was a small book, and on top of that a neatly folded letter which read,  
里面有一本小书，书上面整齐地折叠着一封信，上面写着：

'To Magnolia Bolton, whom now liveth in the home by the willowtree whych hath fallen over. From thy friend ye do notte knowe, Agnes Nutter, Witch'  
给现居柳树下倒下的房子里的玛格诺利亚·博尔顿。来自你不认识的朋友，阿格尼丝·纳特，女巫。

**Purgatory - the Tuesday after the last time we flashbacked there  
炼狱 - 上次我们回忆到那里的那个星期二之后**

When Hastur woke, the world had gone sideways. Literally speaking, on account of him laying on his side, with no idea where he was.  
当哈斯特醒来时，世界已经变得歪歪斜斜。从字面上来说，因为他侧躺着，完全不知道自己在哪里。

He was dizzy, in pain and feeling sick, and vaguely aware of having been patched up.  
他感到头晕、疼痛和恶心，模糊地意识到自己已经被处理过了。

He faintly remembered collapsing in Purgatory, but this place now...  
他模糊地记得在炼狱中昏倒，但是现在这个地方...

"...for everything else... Maybe with stuff from... y'know..." a voice nearby said. Through the fog in his head Hastur recognized it...  
"...其他的事情...也许用...你懂的...的东西..." 附近传来一个声音。哈斯图尔在脑海中的迷雾中认出了它...

No... 不...

No... _please_. 不...拜托。

If Legion was here... As expandable... disposable... as the junior demon was, if he was here, it didn't bode well for Hastur.  
如果军团在这里...像初级恶魔一样可以扩张...可以随意牺牲...如果他在这里，对哈斯图尔来说情况不妙。

"Yes. But at least he'll be alive," a different, oddly distorted voice said. No, not oddly distorted. It was a voice not coming from a human (well, human-shaped) throat. A demon that had not taken a human guise.  
"是的。但至少他还活着，"另一个奇怪扭曲的声音说道。不，不是奇怪扭曲的声音。这是一个不是来自人类（或者说人形）喉咙的声音。一个没有采取人类伪装的恶魔。

Hastur cracked an eye open, finding one covered with gauze or what passed as gauze here, and tried to make out his surroundings with the other.  
哈斯特尔睁开一只眼睛，发现其中一只被纱布或者类似纱布的东西遮住了，他试图用另一只眼睛看清周围的环境。

Oh, joyous day, he was in a place of blurry, blotchy shapes and sparkling lights. He groaned.  
哦，快乐的一天，他身处于模糊、斑驳的形状和闪烁的光芒之中。他呻吟着。

"Oh, he's awake," said the voice, and another blotch of color stepped into Hastur's line of sight. "Hastur, wasn't it?"  
“哦，他醒了。”声音说道，另一团色彩走进哈斯特的视线。“哈斯特，是吧？”

Hastur groaned again, trying to focus.  
哈斯特再次呻吟着，努力集中注意力。

"I took the liberty of getting into your head," said the voice, and the being it belonged to traced a tender clawed hand over Hastur's face. "We both have quite a few skeletons to pick with the rest of Hell."  
“我冒昧地进入了你的思维，”声音说道，而发出声音的生物用一只温柔有爪的手轻抚着哈斯图尔的脸。“我们俩都有很多骨头要与地狱的其他人算账。”

"What?" Hastur rasped weakly.  
"什么？" 哈斯特虚弱地嘶哑着。

"Oh the things you people get up to when I'm asleep. Trying to bring about the Apocalypse without me, now that was just rude."  
哦，当我睡觉的时候，你们这些人都在搞些什么事情啊。竟然想在没有我的情况下引发启示录，这真是太无礼了。

Hastur opened his mouth again, when his brain put some things into order.  
当哈斯特再次张开嘴巴时，他的大脑开始整理一些事情。

He let out a frightened whine.  
他发出了一声惊恐的哀鸣。

"It's... you," he managed. "No..."  
"是...你，" 他勉强说道。"不..."

**London - Still Now, just a bit later than before  
伦敦 - 现在仍然是之前的一点点晚**

"We'll have to call a truce," said Crowley, steering the Bentley through the nightly traffic.  
“我们得停战了。”克劳利说着，驾驶着宾利穿梭在夜晚的交通中。

"Fine. Called," said Ligur, resting his head against the window. The chameleon had curled up on his shoulder and seemed to be sleeping.  
“好的。”利格尔说着，将头靠在窗户上。变色龙蜷缩在他的肩膀上，似乎正在睡觉。

"That was... a little too easy."  
这...太容易了一点。

Ligur groaned deeply. 利古尔深深地呻吟了一声。

"How about you shut up before I change me mind?" he snarled, but without much enthusiasm behind it.  
“你最好闭嘴，免得我改变主意。”他咆哮道，但声音中并没有太多的热情。

"How..." Crowley tried, gesturing vaguely at the glove compartment, "how about some music to pass the time?"  
“怎么样……”克劳利试着说着，手势模糊地指向手套箱，“来点音乐打发时间如何？”

"Fine with me," said Ligur with a dramatic shrug, picking up some CDs. "What's a Velvet Underground?"  
“没问题。”Ligur夸张地耸了耸肩，拿起了一些CD。“什么是维尔维特地下乐队？”

Crowley made a nonplussed face.  
克劳利皱起了眉头。

"Modern," he mumbled. "现代的，"他嘟囔着。

"Bebop?"

Crowley nearly crashed the Bentley into the next lamppost.  
克劳利差点把宾利撞到下一个路灯杆上。

He managed to stop before that happened, luckily, and stared at Ligur in disbelief.  
幸运的是，他设法在那发生之前停了下来，并惊讶地盯着利格尔。

"Wot?" said that one after a moment. "Dunno what it was I said, but it threw you for a loop. Nice." He grinned satisfied.  
“啥？”那个人过了一会儿说道。“不知道我说了什么，但是它让你糊涂了。不错。”他满意地笑了起来。

With a low mutter, Crowley started the engine again, slotting a CD into the player at random. It resulted in Boccherini's Seven Seas Of Rhye.  
克劳利低声咕哝着，再次启动引擎，随意放入一张CD。结果播放出了波切里尼的《七个海洋的韵律》。

Ligur quirked a brow. "Queen?"  
利古尔挑了挑眉毛。“女王？”

"You know them?" 你认识他们吗？

"Am not completely behind times."  
我并不完全落伍。

"Ah." "啊。"

"Just wonderin' 'cause the disc said..."  
"只是好奇，因为光盘上写着..."

"It's been in the car for more than about a fortnight," said Crowley meaningfully. "It happens." He drummed his fingers on the wheel. "Okay, smalltalk question: Who got him back in the day, anyway? Been bothering me ever since. Never got around to checking up on it."  
“已经在车里超过两个星期了。”克劳利有意味地说道。“这种事情常有。”他用手指敲击着方向盘。“好了，闲聊问题：到底是谁在当年找回了他？一直困扰着我，但一直没时间去查证。”

"Mercury?" Ligur pondered. "Not us."  
"水星？" 利古尔思考着说道。"不是我们。"

"Oh... Wait." Crowley peered at the former demon for a moment. Ligur, begrudgingly, gestured to get a pedestrian out of their way. "Hell Us or Heaven Us?"  
"哦...等等。" 克劳利凝视着前恶魔片刻。利古勉强地示意让行人让路。"地狱我们还是天堂我们？"

Ligur gazed darkly at him.  
利古尔阴沉地盯着他。

"Yes." "是的。"

That was as good an answer as Crowley could hope for.  
那是克劳利能够期望的最好答案。

"Look," he then said, "We are forced to live together, we're not allowed to discorporate each other and all that. So we might as well try to be on the same page."  
“看，”他接着说，“我们被迫要一起生活，不能互相分离之类的。所以我们不妨试着达成共识。”

"We already called a truce."  
我们已经达成停战协议了。

"I mean it." 我是认真的。

"So did I..." Ligur suddenly sat up. "Hey! Slow down."  
"我也是..." Ligur 突然坐了起来。"嘿！慢点。"

"Wha-?" "什么？"

"Just slow down." It wasn't a command. There was too much confusion in the former demon's voice.  
“慢一点。” 这不是一个命令。前恶魔的声音中有太多的困惑。

Crowley, baffled, slowed down (almost to what the speed limit was), as a vintage motorcycle roared past them.  
克劳利感到困惑，他减速（几乎达到了限速），一辆老式摩托车呼啸而过。

The driver looked back at them for a moment, likely in reflex, and quickly looked away, revving up his engine and vanishing into the traffic.  
司机瞥了他们一眼，可能是本能地，然后迅速转过头去，加速引擎消失在车流中。

Crowley, meanwhile, stopped the Bentley, staring ahead.  
与此同时，克劳利停下了宾利，凝视前方。

Then he called Aziraphale.  
然后他打电话给阿齐拉费尔。

"Hey, it's me. No... No, that's not it. You're still at the shop? Yes? Good. No... no, it's not important. Ciao."  
嘿，是我。不...不，不是这样。你还在店里吗？是吗？好的。不...不，没什么重要的事。再见。

He hung up and looked at Ligur.  
他挂断电话，看着利古尔。

Neither said anything, but judging by their looks both would have sworn that the guy who just rode past them... had been Aziraphale.  
两人都没有说话，但从他们的表情来看，他们都会发誓刚刚从他们身边骑过的那个人...就是阿齐拉费尔。

"Lord Beelzebub, a word or two," Mammon called, stepping into the other Archdemon's office uninvited.  
贝尔芬巴斯大人，有话要说，"玛蒙不请自来地走进了另一个大恶魔的办公室。

Beelzebub furrowed her brow angrily, and rose. "Have you ever heard of knocking? Or appointmentsz?"  
贝尔芭布皱着眉头生气地站起来。“你听说过敲门吗？还有预约吗？”

She had never held the Archdemon of Greed in any form of high regard. Leviathan was an honest thief at least. When they stole from other departments, it was fair and square. Figuratively speaking.  
她从未将贪婪的大魔王视为什么重要的存在。至少利维坦是个诚实的小偷。当他们从其他部门偷窃时，至少是公平竞争的。就像是个比喻。

Mammon just claimed that he had a right to things. He could almost be mistaken for human when it came to that.  
魔王刚刚声称他有权拥有一切。在这一点上，他几乎可以被误认为是人类。

It was so outrageously irritating.  
真是太让人恼火了。

But Mammon was a demon who held on to the old ways, the days before paperwork. That was one factor about him that was tolerable.  
但是魔王玛门是一个坚守旧有方式的恶魔，那是他身上可以容忍的一个因素。

"We have never needed them in the bad old days, have we?" said Mammon, closing the door behind him. "I do not wish to engage in that conversation again, Beelzebub, and I wager neither do you." Without waiting for a further reaction, Mammon made himself comfortable in one of the chairs.\*\*\*\* "I want to talk about Belphegor and her little pets."  
“在那些糟糕的过去日子里，我们从未需要过他们，是吧？”Mammon说着，关上了门。“我不想再次参与那个对话，Beelzebub，我敢打赌你也不想。”没有等待进一步的反应，Mammon舒适地坐在其中一把椅子上。\*\*\*\*“我想谈谈Belphegor和她的小宠物。”

"I figured asz much." Beelzebub looked to Dagon, who in turn gave Mammon a look that said _'Not going to leave. Tough luck'_.  
“我早就猜到了。”贝利泽布望向达贡，达贡则对玛蒙投去一种意味深长的眼神，意思是“不会离开的，没那么容易”。

\*\*\*\*As far as the chair in Hell allowed for _comfortable_.  
就地狱里的椅子而言，尽可能舒适。

Mammon wrinkled his nose, adjusted his eyepatch, and looked back at Beelzebub.  
麦蒙皱了皱鼻子，调整了眼罩，然后回头看着贝尔塞巴。

"They owe me. Big time, Beelzebub. And the Master agrees with me."  
他们欠我一个大人情，贝尔塞巴。而且主人也同意我的观点。

"The Maszter also agreesz that it'sz worth the entertainment. At leaszt," Beelzebub snarled. "We’ll continue their punishment where we left off when they disszappoint usz. Again."  
"Maszter 也同意这是值得一看的娱乐。至少," Beelzebub 咆哮道。"当他们让我们失望时，我们会继续他们的惩罚。再一次。"

“And I am looking forward to it.”  
"我很期待这件事情。"

"You're not here to talk about that, Mammon," said Beelzebub. "Szo szpit it out."  
“你不是来谈这个的，玛门，”贝利泽布说道。“快说出来。”

Mammon smiled. 魔王微笑着。

"I wish to speak to the Master directly. And your baffling bureaucracy forces me to go through you first. Far less literally than I would like to."  
我希望直接与大师交谈。而你们令人困惑的官僚体系迫使我先通过你来进行沟通。远远不如我所期望的直接。

"The feeling'sz mutual, Mammon." Beelzebub wandered around her desk, coming to a stop behind the other Archdemon. "And why do you wish to bother the Maszter?"  
"感觉互相的，麦蒙。" 贝利泽布在她的办公桌周围徘徊，停在另一个大恶魔的身后。"你为什么想要打扰主人呢？"

"I have... information that might be of interest to him, and by extension, all of Hell."  
我有一些可能对他感兴趣的信息，进而也对地狱的所有人感兴趣。

"Try me, Mammon. What information could be szo important that you'd annoy the Maszter with your preszensze?"  
试试看吧，魔王。有什么信息会如此重要，以至于你要打扰主人的存在？

"Oh, how about the information that Heaven has a surplus angel?"  
哦，那关于天堂有多余的天使的信息呢？

Beelzebub looked at Dagon, eyes wide in surprise.  
贝尔塞巴布惊讶地瞪大眼睛看着达贡。

“Now that, isz intereszting,” she said, stepping in front of Mammon and crossing her arms. “And you know that from where?”  
“现在，这可真有意思。”她说着，走到魔王面前，双臂交叉在胸前。“你是从哪里知道的？”

“Most reliable resources,” Mammon smiled. “But do not think I will give you any advantages. The only one to hear the full account is our Master.”  
“最可靠的资源，”魔玛门微笑着说道。“但别以为我会给你任何优势。只有我们的主人才能听到完整的叙述。”

Beelzebub gazed at him with eyes both scrutinizing and dark.  
贝尔塞巴布用一双既审视又阴暗的眼睛凝视着他。

“I shall szpeak to him,” she murmured annoyed. “Now leave.”  
“我会和他谈谈的。”她生气地嘀咕道。“现在离开。”

Mammon rose and swept a mocking bow.  
魔王马门起身，嘲讽地鞠了一躬。

After the door closed behind him, Dagon stepped over to it, and ripped it open.  
当门在他身后关闭时，Dagon走到门边，猛地将其撕开。

Just to make sure Mammon wasn’t listening in.  
只是为了确保魔王不会偷听。

He wasn’t. 他不是。

“Interesting, innit?” she said, replacing the door with a snap.  
“有趣吧，是吧？”她说着，用力关上了门。

“Yesz. Wonder where he got that from.”  
是的。不知道他从哪里弄来的。

“I could look into it.”  
我可以调查一下。

Beelzebub shook her head. “That hasz to wait. The other thing’sz more important.”  
贝尔则布摇了摇头。“那得等等。另一件事更重要。”

Dagon sighed in defeat as Beelzebub slumped down behind her desk with a groan of the same quality.  
达贡无奈地叹了口气，贝尔塞巴布也无精打采地倒在她的办公桌后面，发出同样低沉的呻吟声。

“Of coursze the basztard’sz aszking about the Maszter _now_!” Beelzebub seethed.  
“当然这个混蛋现在在问关于大师的事情！”贝利泽布愤怒地说道。

Mammon seemed to have this unho-... dam... ridiculous ability to know exactly when Beelzbub was in a tight spot.  
魔王似乎有一种不可思议的能力，能够准确地知道贝尔芭布陷入困境的时刻。

And the one she was in right now was probably the tightest one she could get into:  
而她现在所处的这个可能是她能进入的最紧的一个：

She had lost the Morningstar.  
她丢失了晨星。

**Hell (In Development) - 4004 BC  
地狱（开发中）- 公元前4004年**

The Fallen angel spluttered, clawing at the rocks, trying to pull themself out of the pool of boiling sulphur. It hurt, it hurt, it hurt. Not as much as the Fall from Heaven, not as much as a bit of their essence being burned away.  
堕落的天使在岩石上挣扎着，试图从沸腾的硫磺池中爬出来。疼痛，疼痛，疼痛。虽然不及从天堂坠落的痛苦，也不及他们的本质被烧毁的一部分。

Still. 依然。

Please, they thought desperately. Their legs felt numb and they had trouble moving them at all.  
请，他们绝望地想着。他们的腿感到麻木，几乎无法移动。

They gave a cry of despair, when something... someone grabbed them, hauling them out of the pool.  
当某物...某人抓住他们，将他们从池塘中拖出时，他们发出了绝望的呼喊声。

They coughed, rolling onto their back.  
他们咳嗽着，翻身躺在背上。

Big mistake. 大错误。

They cried out as pain shot through their mangled and seared wings, and they rolled back onto their side.  
他们因为剧痛而大声呼喊，翅膀被撕裂和烧焦，他们翻滚着倒在一边。

"That won't do," a voice said. They looked up. Next to them knelt another of the Fallen. The other looked as mangled as they felt.  
“不行。”一个声音说道。他们抬起头，旁边跪着另一个堕落者。那个人看起来和他们一样破碎不堪。

"You're quite late," said the other. "We thought they were through with kicking everyone out."  
"你来得挺晚的，"另一个人说道。"我们以为他们已经把每个人都踢出去了。"

They chuckled bitterly. "I didn't mean to... I asked questions. Protested even. The Almighty didn't like that."  
他们苦笑着说道：“我并不是有意的……我只是问了些问题，甚至进行了抗议。可是全能者并不喜欢。”

The other nodded, and frowned.  
另一个点了点头，皱了皱眉。

"Where are we?" they asked.  
他们问道：“我们在哪里？”

"Lucifer calls it 'Hell'," said the other.  
另一个人说：“路西法称之为‘地狱’。”

They nodded. Somehow that sounded right. Then the other picked them up into their arms.  
他们点了点头。不知怎么的，那听起来很对。然后另一个人把他们抱起来。

"Wha-?" "什么？"

"If you want to stay alive, you ought to get away from here," said the other. "Others are out hunting for food."  
“如果你想活下去，你应该离开这里，”另一个人说道。“其他人正在外面寻找食物。”

"Oh. They... are eating other... whatever we might be now?"  
哦。他们...正在吃其他...不管我们现在是什么？

"Those that don't get back up fast enough, yes. And then some."  
那些没有及时站起来的人，是的。还有更多的人。

They cringed. 他们退缩了。

"Um... why are you helping me?"  
嗯...你为什么要帮助我？

The other shrugged. "Beats me. I know I shouldn't."  
另一个耸了耸肩。“我也不知道。我知道我不应该。”

They let themself get carried by the other.  
他们让自己被别人牵着走。

"What's your name?" they asked.  
他们问道："你叫什么名字？"

The other grunted. "We don't have names anymore. Just another thing the Almighty took away."  
另一个人咕哝着说道：“我们不再有名字了。这只是全能者夺走的又一件东西。”

They winced. "What..." they ventured, "has been your name?"  
他们皱了皱眉。“你的名字是什么？”他们试探着问道。

The other gave a guttural growl. "Don't make me throw you back into the boiling sulphur. Just call me Hastur, if you have to. Could as well ask you what your name's been."  
另一个发出了一声喉咙低吼。“别逼我把你扔回沸腾的硫磺中去。如果你非要称呼我，就叫我哈斯特吧。顺便问一下，你叫什么名字？”

"I'd actually tell you," they said.  
他们说：“实际上我会告诉你。”

Hastur snorted. 哈斯特嗤笑了一声。

"Fine. Humor me, Fledgling."  
好的。逗逗我吧，新手。

"...Aziraphale..." “...亚齐拉费尔...”

This is not how it went.  
事情并不是这样的。

Right? 对吧？

**Hell, Second Circle - Now  
地狱，第二圈 - 现在**

"Oh, isn't it _intriguing_?"  
哦，这不是很有趣吗？

Asmodeus, Archdemon of Lust, laid back on the fainting couch, eyeing Mammon with growing boredom.  
阿斯莫德，欲望的大恶魔，懒散地躺在昏厥沙发上，眼睛无聊地盯着贪婪的玛蒙。

"Really, Mammon, darling, you come to _me_ about one of my pets? Especially one you vowed to kill most brutally? Oh, don't tell me you've proposed the same nonsense demand to Belphegor about Crowley."  
真的吗，亲爱的玛门，你找我谈论我的宠物？尤其是你曾发誓要残忍地杀死它？哦，别告诉我你对贝尔菲戈提出了同样荒谬的要求，关于克劳利的那个。

"Why would I undertake such a futile endeavor, Asmodeus?" asked Mammon, helping himself to a drink from the other Archdemon's cabinet. "You know her better than any of us," he downed the liquid. "It would be quite like her to hand him over on a whim."  
“为什么我要去做这样毫无意义的努力，阿斯莫德？”玛蒙问道，从另一个大恶魔的柜子里自己倒了一杯饮料。“你比我们任何人都更了解她，”他一口喝下了液体。“她很可能会一时冲动地把他交出去。”

Asmodeus dragged his cane through his hands, not gracing Mammon with a single look. "Debatable. He's one of her favorite playthings, and she's quite like yours truly about those."  
阿斯莫德斯将手杖在手中拖动，没有给玛蒙一丝关注的眼神。“有争议。他是她最喜欢的玩物之一，而她对这些事情和我一样感兴趣。”

Mammon snorted in amusement.  
麦蒙嗤笑一声，觉得很有趣。

"I believe my opinion of that is well known to you," he said, pouring himself another glass and wandering around the room, tracing a hand over the furniture. "What do you reckon? How long will they last? Longer than a week? What will your pet do about the poor sod Heaven entrusted with overseeing Belphegor's little snake? I would bet they will not last more than a week, would you not agree?"  
他倒了一杯酒，边走边在房间里摸索着家具，说道：“我相信你对我的观点已经很了解了。你认为呢？他们还能坚持多久？超过一周吗？你的宠物会对那个可怜的家伙怎么办？毕方的小蛇是天堂委托给他看管的。我敢打赌，他们坚持不过一周，你不同意吗？”

With a sleazy smirk Asmodeus sat up.  
阿斯莫德斯一副猥亵的笑容，坐了起来。

"How much?" he asked. 他问道："多少钱？"

Mammon blinked. 麦蒙眨了眨眼睛。

"Pardon?" 请再说一遍？

"I shall gladly take you up on that bet, Mammon. I know what Duke Hastur is capable of."  
我很乐意接受你的赌约，麦蒙。我知道哈斯特公爵有多厉害。

"He is a fool, Asmodeus. A wreck of a demon who appears to have landed on his head when he Fell."  
他是个傻瓜，阿斯莫德斯。一个看起来像是掉下来时摔在头上的恶魔残骸。

Asmodeus cocked his head, the innocent curiosity Belphegor usually displayed dancing on his features.  
阿斯莫德歪了歪头，贝尔菲戈通常展示出来的天真好奇在他的脸上跳舞着。

"Oh, I must have missed a bit of your speech, Mammon. I wasn't aware we were talking about you all of a sudden."  
哦，我可能漏掉了你的一部分发言，Mammon。我不知道我们突然间在谈论你。

Mammon smiled back at him, unfazed.  
麦蒙毫不动容地对他微笑着。

"I am merely stating some known facts, Asmodeus. But if you wish, we can make that the prize of this little game. If your pet lasts longer than a week, I shall let him off the hook and henceforth refrain from saying anything about him that might cause you distress. If he gets himself discorporated -again- I shall be free to do as I please."  
我只是陈述一些已知的事实，阿斯莫德斯。但如果你愿意，我们可以把这当作这个小游戏的奖品。如果你的宠物能够坚持超过一周，我将放过他，以后不再说任何可能让你烦恼的话。如果他再次解体，那么我将自由行事。

Asmodeus laughed. 阿斯莫德笑了。

"You bet that much on a losing horse?"  
你竟然在一匹输的马上下了那么多赌注？

Mammon smirked. 魔王得意地冷笑了一下。

"Do we have a deal?"  
我们达成交易了吗？

~⧖~

"So," Crowley began, reclining on the park bench, observing the morning crowd in the park. "How's the first night with a supervisor who wants both of us dead been working out for you?"  
“那么，”克劳利开始说道，靠在公园的长椅上，观察着公园里的早晨人群。“第一晚上有一个想要我们俩都死的主管陪伴，你感觉如何？”

Aziraphale watched the ducks for a moment, tilting his head in thought ever so slightly. "Not at all unpleasant, I'd say. We saw to which room he could potentially occupy, and then he settled down and read _The Count of Monte Christo_."  
亚齐拉费尔稍稍歪了一下头，注视着鸭子们片刻。"我得说，一点也不讨厌。我们找了个他可能住的房间，然后他就安顿下来读《基督山伯爵》了。"

Crowley made a slightly amused face.  
克劳利微微一笑。

"The unabridged version, I should add," said Aziraphale.  
“我应该补充一下，这是未删节版的，”阿齐拉费尔说道。

Crowley's expression moved a letter further to _bemused_.  
克劳利的表情更加困惑地向前移动了一封信。

"In French." "用法语。"

With a frustrated groan Crowley leaned away.  
克劳利沮丧地呻吟了一声，向后倚靠。

"Oh, c'mon. This is not the time to try and bullshit me, angel," he scowled. "Hastur can't tell French from his arse."  
"哦，拜托。现在不是时候来糊弄我，亲爱的，"他皱着眉头说道。"哈斯特尔连法语和屁股都分不清楚。"

"I am simply telling you what has happened," Aziraphale insisted in his patented '_I don't mean to be dissenting, but you are clearly wrong_' tone. "How did you fare?" he then added in a friendlier manner.  
“我只是在告诉你发生了什么事情。”亚齐拉费尔坚持着他那独特的“我并不是要反对，但你显然是错的”口吻说道。“你过得如何？”他接着以更友好的方式补充道。

Crowley shrugged. 克劳利耸了耸肩。

"Could have been worse," he said. "Ligur almost went to bless all the water taps in the building after he found out that I kept his coat."  
他说：“本来还能更糟糕。”“Ligur发现我留着他的外套后，差点要去给大楼里的所有水龙头祝福。”

Aziraphale stared at him, baffled and a little alarmed.  
亚齐拉费尔目瞪口呆地盯着他，感到困惑和有些不安。

"Pardon?" 请再说一遍？

"It's not as if I kept it as a trophy or anything. I just didn't know what to..."  
并不是我把它当作奖杯或者什么的。只是我不知道该怎么办...

"You killed him with Holy Water and then kept his coat all this time? Crowley, really."  
你用圣水杀了他，然后一直保存着他的外套？克劳利，真是的。

"C'mon. He's got it back now, hasn't he?"  
快点儿，他现在拿回来了，对吧？

"Um," a third voice interrupted. "Master Crowley?"  
“嗯，”第三个声音打断道。“克劳利大师？”

Aziraphale and Crowley looked at the speaker.  
亚齐拉费尔和克劳利望向说话者。

"Manny!" Crowley greeted the junior demon maybe a little too cheerfully. "Long time, no see. That's a surprise. What brings _you_ here?" He turned to Aziraphale. "Oh, I don't think you've actually met yet. Manny, Aziraphale, Angel of the Eastern Gate. Aziraphale, Manny. Well, Legion, but you catch the drift."  
“曼尼！”克劳利过分开心地打招呼道，“好久不见了，真是个惊喜。你来这里有什么事？”他转向亚齐拉费尔，“哦，我想你们实际上还没见过面。曼尼，这位是亚齐拉费尔，东方之门的天使。亚齐拉费尔，曼尼。嗯，军团，但你明白我的意思。”

"Err, charmed, I'm sure," said Aziraphale.  
“嗯，很高兴认识你，”阿齐拉费尔说道。

"Now, what brings you here?" Crowley asked the junior demon again, and Legion fished a letter from his satchel.  
“现在，你来这里有什么事？”克劳利再次问道，而军士恶魔莱吉昂从他的背包里掏出了一封信。

"Orders for you and Duke Hastur, Sir."  
给您和哈斯特公爵的订单，先生。

Crowley snatched the envelope, holding it as if it personally offended him, and looked the junior demon up and down.  
克劳利抓起信封，仿佛它亲自冒犯了他一样，然后审视着那个初级恶魔。

"Hell is rolling out all the work that piled up in this little interim, isn't it?" he frowned, broke the wax seal and began reading.  
“地狱正在推出这段短暂间隙中积压的所有工作，是吗？”他皱了皱眉，打破蜡封，开始阅读。

"Umm, Sir?" Legion dared. "I'm not entirely certain if you should read this..." he gestured at Aziraphale.  
"嗯，先生？" 莱吉恩冒险说道。"我不太确定您是否应该阅读这个..." 他指了指阿齐拉费尔。

Crowley waved them off. 克劳利挥手示意他们离开。

"Naw," he said. "What with Hastur being his supervisor it doesn't really matter."  
“算了吧，”他说道。“有哈斯特作为他的主管，这事情并不重要。”

Legion nodded, and Crowley looked at him briefly.  
军团点了点头，克劳利短暂地看了他一眼。

"That'd be all?" he asked, then looked back down at the letter.  
"就这些了吗？"他问道，然后又低头看着那封信。

"Yes," said Legion. "是的，" 莱吉恩说道。

"Then be on your merry way," Crowley mumbled. "Oh, this is just great," he murmured once the junior demon had left, letting out an exhausted groan.  
"那就赶紧走吧，" 克劳利嘟囔着说。"哦，这真是太好了，" 他在初级恶魔离开后低声嘀咕着，发出一声疲惫的呻吟。

"Bad news?" asked Aziraphale. "By Hell's standards, I mean."  
"坏消息吗？"亚齐拉费尔问道。"按照地狱的标准来说，我是指那种。"

"Caught you the first time, angel," mumbled Crowley, while turning the parchment ever so slightly. "It's a find and retrieve assignment. Ah, I hate those." He looked back at Aziraphale, squirming a little. "It's this whole drag'em to Hell business. 'Oh looky here, the bugger sold his soul, now their time's up, go get'em.' I hate that."  
克劳利嘟囔着说：“第一次就抓到你了，天使。”他轻轻地翻动着羊皮纸。“这是一个找回任务。啊，我讨厌这种任务。”他回头看着阿齐拉费尔，有些不安地扭动着。“整个把他们拖进地狱的事情真是太烦了。‘哦，看这里，这家伙卖了自己的灵魂，现在他们的时间到了，去抓住他们吧。’我真是讨厌这个。”

Aziraphale pondered this.  
亚齐拉费尔沉思了一下。

"I'm aware. I could interfere again," he began. "Depending on the human, as always of course, and..."   
"我知道。我可以再次干涉，"他开始说道。"当然，这取决于人类，一如既往，还有..."

"Naw, never mind, angel." Crowley waved him off politely, folded the letter and pocketed it. "Know what? Hastur can do this one alone."  
“算了，别介意，天使。”克劳利礼貌地挥了挥手，将信件折叠起来放进口袋里。“你知道吗？哈斯特尔可以独自完成这个任务。”

"Hell won't like that." 地狱不会喜欢这个。

"It's Hell, not liking something on at least base level is mandatory." Crowley rubbed his temples. "Let's head back then, shall we?"  
"这真是地狱，至少在基本层面上不喜欢某样东西是必须的。”克劳利揉了揉太阳穴。“那我们就回去吧，好吗？”

Aziraphale nodded and got up, just as Crowley let out a howl of despair.  
亚齐拉费尔点了点头，站了起来，就在克劳利发出一声绝望的嚎叫时。

"Rock science!" he wailed, throwing his hands up. "For crying out loud, Hastur!"  
"天哪！"他嚎叫着，举起双手。“哈斯特尔，别闹了！”

Aziraphale did not ask. 亚齐拉费尔没有询问。

~⧖~

Miss Mag screwed open a bleary eye, trying her best to focus on the antique alarm clock on the nightstand.  
麦格小姐揉开了一只朦胧的眼睛，努力着将目光集中在床头柜上的古董闹钟上。

It read one and thirty something. About five hours of sleep, now wasn't that something?  
读了一个点三十多。大约睡了五个小时，这不是件很有意思的事吗？

Miss Mag rolled onto her back with a wince, stretching the best she could. Good Lord, what a night. She sat up slowly and looked at the box behind the alarm clock, and then at the small book and letter on her bed.  
麦格小姐痛苦地翻身，尽力伸展身体。天哪，这是个多么糟糕的夜晚。她慢慢坐起身，看着闹钟后面的盒子，然后看着床上的小书和信件。

So it wasn't a dream.  
所以这不是一个梦。

Her laptop on the pillow beside her had long since gone into sleep mode, and Miss Mag figured it might do with a quick reboot the same way she could do with a large cup of coffee.  
她旁边的枕头上的笔记本电脑早已进入了睡眠模式，麦格小姐觉得它可能需要快速重启，就像她需要一大杯咖啡一样。

She peeled herself out of bed, picked up the book and headed for the kitchen.  
她从床上爬起来，拿起书走向厨房。

The night had gone by traversing the internet for information on this ominous 'Agnes Nutter', finding far less than Mag had hoped for.  
整个晚上，玛格在互联网上搜索有关这个不祥的“阿格尼丝·纳特”（Agnes Nutter）的信息，但结果远远不如她所期望的那样丰富。

At least she had found three things:  
至少她找到了三件事情：

1.  Agnes was real. 艾格妮丝是真实的。
2.  Agnes was a witch and a prophetess.  
    阿格尼丝是一位女巫和先知。
3.  Agnes had written a book of prophecies.  
    阿格尼丝写了一本预言书。

Around four in the morning Mag had given up on finding out more about Agnes, and had concentrated on finding out things about the book.  
大约凌晨四点，玛格放弃了对阿格尼丝的进一步了解，转而专注于了解关于这本书的事情。

At around half past seven she had located the number of an antique books shop in London specializing on prophecies, and had made a call.  
大约七点半左右，她找到了伦敦一家专门经营预言书籍的古董书店的电话号码，并打了个电话。

With mixed success, as the call had cut off just as Mag was about to ask the kindly man answering about Agnes. Trying to call again via mobile hadn't worked either, and Mag had figured there must have been something wrong with the line on London's ends, and had gone to sleep, intending to try again later.  
通话成功与否，就在Mag正要询问那位友善的男士关于Agnes的事情时，电话突然中断了。试图通过手机再次拨打也没有成功，Mag猜想伦敦那边的线路可能出了问题，于是决定先睡一觉，打算稍后再试。

Said 'later' was now. 所谓的“以后”就是现在。

Well, almost. First get something to eat, then maybe a bit of fresh air... and then try calling around three or six, that should be enough time to fix the lines.   
差不多了。先找点吃的，然后可能出去透透气...然后大约三点或六点左右再试着打电话，那应该足够时间修好线路了。

Miss Mag settled down in the kitchen with book and coffee, and began reading again. She was very certain the book in her hands was not the one Agnes was known for. Not going by what Miss Mag had been able to find on the net.🔄  ❓

The only thing that worried her a little (and for a moment had her wonder if this was some joke after all) was that some of the prophecies mentioned her _by name_.  
唯一让她有点担心的事情（一时间让她怀疑这是否只是个玩笑）是一些预言中提到了她的名字。

Like the one she was reading at random now.  
就像她现在随便读的那本一样。

_'I tell ye thif, Magnolia, when he who is shalle meet him who is notte, beware the Angel with the Deville's face, for he weareth it not by choice but by sorrow.'  
我告诉你，Magnolia，当他那个是的人遇见他那个不是的人时，要小心那个带着魔鬼面孔的天使，因为他戴上它并非出于选择，而是出于悲伤。_

Not that that made a lot of sense, but it was outrageously intriguing to see Magnolia being addressed like this. She read the next one.  
虽然这并没有太多意义，但看到Magnolia被这样称呼实在是令人着迷。她继续阅读下一篇。

_'Putte ye down thy cup, Magnolia, so that ye notte spill thy koffie.'  
放下你的杯子，玛格诺利亚，免得你洒了咖啡。_

"What?" Miss Mag muttered, staring at the text. Absent-mindedly she sipped her coffeed, just as the handle broke, the, thankfully, lukewarm beverage spilling over her bathrobe.  
“什么？”玛格小姐嘟囔着，盯着那段文字。她心不在焉地喝了一口咖啡，就在这时，杯子的把手突然断了，幸运的是，温热的咖啡洒在了她的浴袍上。

Miss Mag cursed quietly, then stared wide-eyed at the book again.  
玛格小姐轻声咒骂了一下，然后再次惊讶地盯着书看。

Now, wasn't that something?  
现在，那不是件令人惊讶的事吗？

Miss Mag decided to forego coffee and cleaning, and prayed that 'calling' was an option. There was information to be gathered.  
玛格小姐决定放弃喝咖啡和打扫卫生，而是祈祷“打电话”是一个选择。有信息需要收集。

Not too far away, in the woods, a man strolled around near the Them's little hide-out. The children were at school, and he seemed to have all the time in the world.  
不远处的树林里，一个男人在Them的小藏身处附近漫步。孩子们都在上学，他似乎有着充裕的时间。

This is Mr Nicholas. 这是尼古拉斯先生。

Let's take a look at him, shall we?  
我们来看看他，好吗？

He's an average man with dark hair and a face that people called handsome. People also had trouble with remembering details about him.  
他是一个普通的男人，黑发，长相被人们称为英俊。人们也很难记住关于他的细节。

He was sitting on a fallen tree nearby, a small, worn notebook in his lap, twirling a pen.  
他坐在附近的一棵倒下的树上，膝盖上放着一本小而破旧的笔记本，手中旋转着一支钢笔。

He stared into the distance, listening to the animals moving around him.  
他凝视着远方，倾听着周围动物的活动声。

Had he been paying attention he might have noticed that a lot of nocturnal animals where out and about quite early today.  
如果他注意到了，他可能会注意到今天很多夜行动物早早地出现了。

~⧖~

**Purgatory - Four months after the failed Armageddon  
炼狱 - 失败的末日审判四个月后**

There was a spot in Purgatory that had been theirs.  
在炼狱中有一个地方是属于他们的。

A small corner far away enough from Hell to not get bothered, but close enough for no one to notice they were gone.  
一个远离地狱的小角落，足够远离麻烦，但又足够近，让没有人注意到他们的离去。

They had found it by pure chance centuries ago\*, and though it had changed appearance as everything, it still remained theirs.  
他们几个世纪前纯粹偶然地找到了它，尽管它的外观发生了变化，但它仍然属于他们。

\* After Hastur had taken a wrong step and crashed through the rotten floorboards.  
在哈斯特尔迈出错误的一步并穿过烂掉的地板后。

One could see the stars from here.  
从这里可以看到星星。

But now? 现在呢？

There was no 'theirs' without Ligur.  
没有利古尔，就没有他们的东西。

Still Hastur had come here now, a bit against Belphegor's advice.  
哈斯特尔还是来到了这里，虽然有点违背了贝尔菲戈的建议。

His wounds were still not fully healed, and perhap some never would. But he needed this now. Now that everything was coming back, now that he had the chance to think.  
他的伤口还没有完全愈合，也许有些永远无法愈合。但他现在需要这个。现在一切都回来了，他有机会思考了。

He needed this moment of silence. Needed _their_ spot.  
他需要这一刻的寂静。需要他们的位置。

He sat by the opening and watched the night sky.  
他坐在洞口，凝视着夜空。

He had half expected for the stars to have lost their shine. They hadn't. Why would they?  
他曾经有一半的期望星星失去了它们的光辉。但它们并没有。为什么会呢？

It was just a demon who had been annihilated. These things happened. The only unusual thing was that that way of extinction was brought forth by another demon, and not a human or an angel.  
这只是一个被消灭的恶魔而已。这些事情发生过。唯一不寻常的是，这种消亡方式是由另一个恶魔而非人类或天使所引发的。

So why bother? 那为什么还要费心呢？

Hastur knew he shouldn't. He knew he should only be angry over the loss of a valuable tool, some_thing_ that had given him an advantage.  
哈斯特知道他不应该这样做。他知道他只应该对失去了一件有价值的工具感到愤怒，这是给了他优势的东西。

Instead he felt sick. Nauseous and delirious. Suffocating.  
相反，他感到恶心。恶心和神志不清。令人窒息。

And angry, yes. 生气，是的。

But it was a different kind of anger. It was a kind of despair, of fury that he had never felt before, not even after the Fall.  
但这是一种不同的愤怒。这是一种绝望的愤怒，一种他从未有过的愤怒，甚至在堕落之后也没有。

A different kind of anger, a different kind of hatred than one he had felt against... a lot of people. Some he'd never thought he'd hate. Some he never before dared to hate.  
一种不同的愤怒，一种不同于他对很多人的愤恨。一些他从未想过会憎恨的人。一些他以前从未敢憎恨的人。

But what he felt now...  
但是他现在所感受到的...

He wanted to scream.  
他想尖叫。

He had screamed when it had happened.  
当发生时，他尖叫了。

And then... He blanked a little on the details. When Crowley had raised that plant mister something had short-circuited in Hastur's brain and the next few moments were but a blur.  
然后...他在细节上有点脑子一片空白。当克劳利拿起那个植物喷雾器时，哈斯特的大脑短路了，接下来的几个瞬间只是一片模糊。

Had he screamed? He couldn't tell. He vaguely remembered chasing Crowley down the telephone line. The ansaphone, the angel's message.  
他是否尖叫了？他说不清楚。他依稀记得追逐克劳利穿过电话线。答录机，天使的留言。

Those telemarketers. He remembered those. Pretty tasty. They had it coming, too.  
那些电话推销员。他还记得那些。相当美味。他们也活该。

He remembered using the radio in that office to contact Hell. Tell them what had happened.  
他记得在那个办公室使用收音机联系地狱，告诉他们发生了什么事。

Then it went blurry again. He had gone after Crowley, finding the little runt stuck in traffic.  
然后又变得模糊了。他追着克劳利去了，发现那个小家伙被困在交通堵塞中。

At the M25. 在M25上。

Hastur grinned a tired grin.  
哈斯特疲倦地露出了一个微笑。

Crowley had given this big speech about his hijinks with that road back in the day, acting as if no other demon would know what 'Odegra' means. And then he complained when it bit him in the arse.  
克劳利曾经大谈特谈他当年在那条路上的恶作剧，仿佛其他恶魔都不知道“奥德格拉”是什么意思。结果，当这事反咬了他一口时，他又抱怨起来。

But even then Crowley couldn't just accept defeat and come along silently.  
但即使如此，克劳利仍然不能接受失败，默默地跟随。

No, he had started to drive into the fire.  
不，他已经开始驶入火灾中了。

Hastur had tried to grab at the wheel, and Crowley... Crowley had bit him. Fangs and venom and all.  
哈斯特试图抓住方向盘，而克劳利...克劳利咬了他。尖牙和毒液一起。

Hastur didn't know if he did catch fire, he had been rendered too dizzy for that too quickly.  
哈斯特尔不知道自己是否着火了，他被迅速击晕，无法分辨。

But he had gotten back to Hell.  
但他已经回到了地狱。

And then there was the trial.  
然后就是审判。

Hastur should have listened to his gut and just beaten the little snake into a pulp.  
哈斯特尔应该听从自己的直觉，直接把那条小蛇打得稀烂。

Instead, when things had not worked as expected, he had fretted over whether or not that plant mister had held Holy Water.  
然而，当事情没有按预期发展时，他曾为那个植物喷雾器是否装有圣水而苦恼不已。

For a few hours. 几个小时。

Then Hell had turned its attention to him.  
然后地狱将注意力转向了他。

That was about four months ago...  
那是大约四个月前...

Hastur figured he hadn't the energy to scream anymore.  
哈斯特尔觉得自己已经没有精力再尖叫了。

Not after screaming, wailing and crying his throat raw.  
不是在尖叫、哭泣和嚎啕大哭之后。

In pain, in agony, in fear.  
痛苦中，煎熬中，恐惧中。

He leaned his head against the wall, looking up at the starry sky.  
他靠着墙壁，抬头望着星空。

He didn't think at all for a moment.  
他一时完全没有思考。

Then he caught himself humming a tune. A song he had heard up on Earth not too long ago. A good song.  
然后他发现自己哼起了一首曲子。一首他不久前在地球上听过的歌曲。一首好歌。

The words came creeping back to him, soft on his tongue, coaxing him to let them out...  
这些词悄悄地回到他的脑海，轻轻地在他的舌尖上游走，诱使他将它们说出来...

He let them... 他让他们...

_'I know you exist, for years I have said so.  
我知道你的存在，多年来我一直这么说。_

_Me arms couldn't hold you, though me heart couldn't let go.  
我的双臂无法拥抱你，但我的心却无法放手。_

_Are you somewhere out there tonight still singin' to me?'  
你今晚还在某个地方为我唱歌吗？_

Silly, sentimental little words. But so... soothing. So right right now... No, he... he shouldn't think like that. Humans did that. Angels, maybe. Not demons. It was a stupid thing to do.  
傻傻的、多愁善感的小话。但是...如此安慰人心。如此正确...不，他...他不应该这样想。人类会这样做。天使，或许。不是恶魔。这是一件愚蠢的事情。

Hastur sighed, pulled up his legs and rested his head on his knees.  
哈斯特叹了口气，抬起双腿，将头靠在膝盖上休息。

People had always deemed him stupid. He wasn't stupid. He had trouble with new concepts, sure, and maybe his brain was going as straight as the bloody M25, but he wasn't stupid, no matter what people like Crowley thought.  
人们一直认为他很蠢。他并不蠢。他确实对新概念有困难，也许他的大脑像M25高速公路一样曲曲折折，但无论克劳利这样的人怎么想，他都不是蠢货。

Ligur had been the only one to see right through him. Saw what Hastur was often times doing. Played along, teased him right back, guided him along when needed.  
Ligur是唯一一个看穿他的人。看到Hastur经常做的事情。他陪着他玩，逗他开心，需要的时候引导他。

They worked so well together, not just in that way.  
他们在一起工作得非常出色，不仅仅是在那方面。

But now Ligur was gone. Hastur knew the... actual Antichrist had undone a lot of things on Earth. Brought back a lot of people... But not Ligur. Maybe the boy didn't want to. Maybe he couldn't.  
但现在利古尔已经离开了。哈斯特知道...真正的敌基督已经在地球上解开了许多事情。带回了很多人...但没有利古尔。也许这个男孩不想回来。也许他不能回来。

Whatever the truth was, people expected Hastur to just accept things.  
无论真相如何，人们都期望哈斯特接受事实。

He looked at his hands.  
他看着自己的双手。

He had always been a fighter, underneath it all. Until people decided they knew better. Sure, they kept him around to torture souls after dragging them to Hell. But at bottom line they had declawed him, pulled his teeth...  
他一直都是个斗士，无论如何。直到人们决定他们更懂。当然，他们把他留在那里，折磨那些被拖入地狱的灵魂。但归根结底，他们已经削去了他的爪子，拔掉了他的牙齿...

He winced at the thought, the choice of words his mind threw at him making his stomach turn as he absent-mindedly ran his tongue along his teeth.  
他一想到这个，脑海中涌现出的措辞让他不禁皱了皱眉，他不经意地用舌头沿着牙齿来回刮动，胃里也因此翻江倒海。

Belphegor's work was... not a miracle... Hastur knew miracles. He didn't know a word for what the Archdemon had done to... _for_ him.  
贝尔菲戈的工作...并不是奇迹...哈斯塔知道奇迹。他对大恶魔为他所做的事情没有一个词。

He had always been a fighter, always been at his best when he trusted his gut.  
他一直都是一个斗士，当他相信自己的直觉时，他总是表现出色。

But he let others tell him what was good for him.  
但他让别人告诉他什么对他有好处。

He looked back up at the sky again. How did another line in that song go again?  
他再次抬头望向天空。那首歌里的另一句歌词是怎么唱的来着？

'_I've no God an' no masters above me an' no further to fall.'_  
我没有上帝，也没有任何掌控我，也没有更多可以跌落的地方。

Hastur smiled. 哈斯特微笑着。

So be it. 就这样吧。

**London, Soho - Now  
伦敦，苏豪 - 现在**

Crowley grabbed Aziraphale's arm as the angel was about to unlock the shop's door.  
当天使阿齐拉费尔正要打开店门时，克劳利抓住了他的胳膊。

"What's the matter, dear?" asked Aziraphale, watching Crowley flick his tongue out.  
“亲爱的，怎么了？”亚齐拉费尔问道，看着克劳利伸出舌头。

"Oh for..." Crowley groaned. "Ligur's here," he said.  
"哦，天哪..." 克劳利叹息道。"利古尔来了，" 他说道。

Aziraphale tutted, turning the key.  
亚齐拉费尔嘴里咂了一声，转动了钥匙。

"I told you, you should have informed him about where you're going."  
我告诉过你，你应该告诉他你要去哪里。

Crowley made an offended sounding noise, and followed Aziraphale into the shop.  
克劳利发出了一声不满的声音，跟着阿齐拉费尔走进了店里。

"We'd have t' throw'n entire cow," Ligur's voice sounded from the back room. "An' hope it dun land in the sulphur pools..."  
“我们得把整头牛扔进去，”利格尔的声音从后面的房间传来。“然后希望它能掉进硫磺池里…”

"But we _could_ try it."  
"但是我们可以试试看。"

That was Hastur. 那是哈斯特尔。

Crowley, brow quirked, looked at Aziraphale, quickly mouthed 'Don't. No. No. Just. Don't ask. No.' and bravely strutted into the back room.  
克劳利皱了皱眉，看着阿齐拉费尔，迅速嘴唇动了动，默默传达着“别问了，不要。不。别问。不。”然后勇敢地走进了后面的房间。

"Hi," he said. 他说：“嗨。”

Sort of. Half the greeting got stuck in his throat when he saw the little arrangement on the old sofa.  
有点。当他看到旧沙发上的小布置时，他的问候话半截噎在了喉咙里。

Ligur cuddled into one corner, Hastur resting his head on the former demon's legs, his own legs dangling over the side, and the chameleon skittering around on his chest.  
利古尔蜷缩在一个角落里，哈斯图尔将头靠在前恶魔的腿上，自己的腿垂在一侧，变色龙在他的胸前蹦跳着。

"Y'know yer supposed to tell me where yer goin'?" Ligur greeted back.  
“你知道你应该告诉我你要去哪儿吗？”利古尔回应道。

Crowley grunted dismissively.  
克劳利不屑地咕哝了一声。

"You apparently knew exactly where I'd be," he said.  
他说道：“显然你很清楚我会在哪里。”

"Not that many options, are there?"  
选项不是很多，对吧？

Crowley shrugged, blatantly nestling himself onto the sofa between the backrest and Hastur's legs. The response in the form of an annoyed groan was drowned out by Aziraphale asking,  
克劳利耸了耸肩，毫不掩饰地挤进沙发的靠背和哈斯特的腿之间。哈斯特发出的恼怒呻吟被阿齐拉费尔询问的声音淹没了。

"The nice lady who called this morning, has she called again yet?"  
今天早上打电话来的那位和蔼的女士，她又打过电话了吗？

Hastur lazily turned his head to the side.  
哈斯特懒洋洋地把头转向一边。

"No," he said. "But y'got two calls asking for first edition Dickens, one for Austen, one wrong number, an' one guy been lookin' fer 'That book wi' the gay fish'.  Think 'e means 'Homo Faber'."  
“不，”他说。“但是有两个电话要求查找狄更斯的首版书，一个要求奥斯汀的书，一个是打错了号码，还有一个人一直在找‘那本有快乐鱼的书’。我想他指的是《人类的条件》。”

Aziraphale pondered that, while Crowley smirked at Hastur. A smirk that faltered when Hastur gave him a 'Say anything 'bout ansaphones an' I'll rip yer spleen out through yer eyesockets' look.\*\*  
亚齐拉费尔沉思着，而克劳利则冷笑着看着哈斯特尔。当哈斯特尔投以一种“你敢说电话答录机的事，我就会从你的眼窝里撕下你的脾脏”的眼神时，克劳利的冷笑变得有些僵硬。

\*\*As apathetic as Hastur could come across, conveying messages, especially threats, with only his eyes was a discipline he wholly excelled it. Though Crowley wondered why Hastur regularly admonished him not to take any wooden nickels, or to not sell him a dog.  
尽管哈斯特尔看起来冷漠无情，但他通过眼神传递信息，尤其是威胁，是他完全擅长的一门技艺。克劳利不禁想知道为什么哈斯特尔经常警告他不要接受任何木头铜板，或者不要卖给他一只狗。

"Usually you don't care whether or not someone calls again," said Crowley. "Heaven, usually you rejoice in someone not calling again."  
“通常你不在乎别人是否再次打电话，”克劳利说道。“天堂，通常你会为别人不再打电话而感到高兴。”

"Oh, yes," said Aziraphale, hanging up his overcoat. "But there was something odd about her. About her call, to be accurate."  
“噢，是的。”阿齐拉费尔说着，脱下他的大衣。“但她的电话有点奇怪。准确地说，是关于她的电话。”

"Which was?" asked Crowley, as the chameleon used his arm to get onto the backrest.  
"是哪个？" 克劳利问道，当变色龙用他的手臂爬上靠背时。

"She said she wasn't looking for any book; something I greatly appreciated; but whether or not I would have any information about a specific author. Specific prophet, to be precise."  
她说她不是在找任何一本书；这让我非常感激；但是她是否会有关于某位特定作者的任何信息。确切地说，是某位特定的先知。

"Whom?" 谁？

"She didn't say. Or, better, well, she most likely tried to, but before she could say anything, the line went dead."  
她没说。或者说，嗯，她很可能试图说，但还没来得及说什么，电话就断了。

Crowley craned his neck around, looking towards where Aziraphale had one of his antique phones.  
克劳利扭动脖子，朝着阿齐拉费尔放置着一部古董电话的地方望去。

"See why'm asking you to get a proper phone?" he said.  
他说：“看看为什么我要求你买一部正经的手机？”

"They are proper phones."  
它们是正经的手机。

Crowley let out a groan, as that response had come from everyone else in the room in unison.  
克劳利发出一声呻吟，因为房间里的每个人都异口同声地做出了同样的回应。

Thankfully, one of the offending apparatuses rang before he could say anything.  
幸运的是，在他还没来得及说什么之前，其中一个令人讨厌的装置响了起来。

Aziraphale picked up, and going by his words he was talking to the caller from earlier the day. Crowley listened with only half an ear, more interested in watching the chameleon tumble down from the backrest back onto Hastur's chest.  
亚齐拉费尔接起电话，从他的话语来看，他正在与之前的来电者交谈。克劳利只是半听半听地倾听，更感兴趣的是看着变色龙从靠背上摔下来，落在哈斯特的胸口上。

"What..." Aziraphale suddenly said in an alarmed tone that made Crowley snap his head around.  
“什么……”阿齐拉费尔突然以一种惊慌的语气说道，这让克劳利猛地转过头来。

"Would you kindly repeat that?" Aziraphale continued, now with four sets of eyes staring at him. "What do you mean you received a book from Agnes Nutter?"  
"你能麻烦再说一遍吗？" 阿齐拉费尔继续说道，现在有四双眼睛盯着他。"你是说你收到了阿格妮丝·纳特的一本书？"

### Chapter Text 章节正文

~⧖~

**Elsewhere - Two months after the failed Apocalypse  
在别处 - 失败的启示录两个月后**

THIS IS... UNPRECEDENTED, said Death.  
死神说道：“这是…前所未有的。”

"Tell me 'bout it," Ligur grunted, rubbing the side of his face. "Didn't know we get a thereafter, too."  
“跟我说说吧。”利格尔咕哝着，揉着脸颊。“我还不知道我们还有个以后呢。”

He sat up, a little unsteadily, shaking his head as if to get water out of his ear.  
他有点不稳地坐了起来，摇摇头，好像要把耳朵里的水甩出来。

WE DON'T. 我们不这样做。

"Wot?" "什么？"

BEINGS OF ANGEL STOCK DO NOT GET A THEREAFTER. OVER MEANS OVER. AND HOLY WATER IS ONE BIG OVER FOR A DEMON.  
天使血统的存在没有来世。结束就是结束。而圣水对于恶魔来说是一个巨大的终结。

Ligur cocked his head. He knew he should be furious, but being very permanently dead put quite a damper on all of the righteous wrath he was feeling.\*  
利古尔歪了歪头。他知道自己应该勃然大怒，但永远地死亡对他所有正义的愤怒都产生了相当大的压制。

\*Had he been paying attention here, the things to come might have been a little less surprising. 'Righteous wrath' wasn't in a _demon's_ job description after all.  
如果他在这里留心的话，未来的事情可能会少一些惊讶。毕竟，“正义的愤怒”并不在恶魔的工作描述中。

"Am here, ain't I?" he said, and then a thought crossed his mind. "Shouldn't y'be elsewhere?"  
“我在这里，不是吗？”他说道，然后脑海中闪过一个念头。“你不应该在别处吗？”

THIS IS ELSEWHERE. 这是别处。

"Yer a wisearse, Azrael. Y'know how I mean."  
阿兹拉埃尔，你真是个聪明的家伙。你知道我是什么意思。

THE APOCALYPSE, YES. 末日，是的。

"I mean, sure, yer technically everywhere, but..."  
我是说，当然，你从技术上来说无处不在，但是...

IT WAS CALLED OFF. 活动取消了。

"...wot?" "...什么？"

THE BOY DECIDED AGAINST IT. Death explained what happened.  
男孩决定放弃。死神解释了发生的事情。

"... He _what_?" Ligur was shaking. The sense of anger, fury and betrayal... in over 6000 years he only ever felt like this once. "'Twas all for NOTHING?" he barked. "This... no! Ev'rything we did... an', an' hoped for... an' he..."  
“他说什么？”利古尔颤抖着。愤怒、狂怒和背叛的感觉……在6000多年的时间里，他只有一次有过这样的感受。“这一切都白费了？”他咆哮道。“这……不行！我们所做的一切……还有我们的希望……他……”

AND TWO MONTHS HAVE PASSED SINCE.  
两个月过去了。

"That's not helping!" Ligur slumped. "That's not... wait." He stared up at Death. "Two months? But... I mean... I mean..." He took a deep breath, held it for a moment and exhaled. "...What? Shouldn't I have... I thought... What now?"  
“这没什么帮助！”利古尔沮丧地垂下了肩膀。“这不是...等等。”他仰望着死神。“两个月？但是...我是说...我是说...”他深吸了一口气，稍作停顿后呼出。“...什么？我不应该...我以为...现在怎么办？”

Death simply shrugged. 死亡只是耸了耸肩。

I BELIEVE IT IS UP TO YOU TO FIND OUT, he said.  
他说：“我相信这取决于你自己去发现。”

"Terrific, really." Ligur frowned, looking around. Then he got up and dusted off his clothes. "It was 'Go to where it feels right,' right?"  
"太棒了，真的。"利古尔皱了皱眉头，四处张望着。然后他站起来，拍了拍衣服上的灰尘。"是说'去感觉对的地方'，对吧？"

Death nodded. 死神点了点头。

"Well then," Ligur said, and marched off.  
"那好吧，"利格尔说着，然后大步离开。

For a moment, Death was inclined to wish him good luck. Especially since, by all means, he was headed for Heaven.  
有一瞬间，死神倾向于祝他好运。尤其是因为，无论如何，他都要去天堂。

UNPRECEDENTED INDEED. 确实是前所未有的。

~⧖~

**London, Soho - Just when we left off  
伦敦，苏豪区 - 就在我们离开的时候**

"That is..." said Aziraphale, hand flexing lightly around the receiver. "Peculiar. I... must ask, are you... yes. Oh that'd be helpful... yes... oh my... yes, yes."  
“那就是……”阿齐拉费尔说着，手指轻轻握紧了电话机。“很奇怪。我……必须问一下，你是……是的。哦，那会很有帮助……是的……哦天啊……是的，是的。”

Crowley looked at the little party on the couch, giving them a hapless shrug.  
克劳利看着沙发上的小群体，无奈地耸了耸肩。

"You are _where_?" Aziraphale suddenly burst out, drawing everyone's attention again. "Ah! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout. No. Yes... very surprised. Yes. It's... you see, about Agnes Nutter and... uh-huh. Oh, that's a splendid idea, my dear. Oh, yes, we'll be open tomorrow at..."  
"你在哪里？"阿齐拉费尔突然大声问道，再次吸引了所有人的注意力。"啊！对不起，我不是故意大声说的。不，是的...非常惊讶。是的。你看，关于阿格尼丝·纳特和...嗯嗯。哦，这是个绝妙的主意，亲爱的。是的，明天我们会开门的..."

Now Crowley began waving frantically, pointing at himself and Hastur.  
现在克劳利开始疯狂地挥舞着手，指着自己和哈斯特尔。

"Oh, could you kindly wait for a moment," Aziraphale told the caller and covered the receiver with his hand. "What is it?" he stagewhispered.  
“哦，你能稍等一下吗？”阿齐拉费尔对着电话说着，用手捂住了听筒。“怎么了？”他小声问道。

Crowley simply pulled the letter from his jacket, waving it meaningfully. "Not the time!" he stagewhispered back.  
克劳利从夹克里拿出信件，有意义地挥舞着。他低声说道：“现在不是时候！”

Hastur, eyebrow quirked, struggled a little to sit up and snatch the letter, and, as he failed, simply let his tongue do the job.  
哈斯特尔皱起眉头，费力地坐起来抓住了那封信，但是由于失败了，他只好任由舌头来完成这个任务。

Crowley gave a grunt of protest, while Aziraphale turned back to the caller.  
克劳利发出了一声抗议的咕哝，而阿齐拉费尔则转身面向来电者。

"I'm terribly sorry, my... ah, assistant... just informed me that tomorrow is not a good choice for a visit... yes? Uh-huh? Oh. Oh certainly. Oh, splendid. Yes. Yes, I shall be seeing you then. Toodleloo."  
非常抱歉，我的...嗯，助手...刚刚告诉我明天不是一个好的访问选择...是吗？嗯嗯？哦。哦，当然。哦，太棒了。是的。是的，那么我会在那时见到你。再见。

With a soft shake of his head he hung up. "Oh my, oh my..." he said, wringing his hands.  
他轻轻地摇了摇头，挂断了电话。“哎呀，哎呀……”他说着，握着双手不停地搓动。

"What happened?" asked Crowley, followed by an 'Ouch' as Hastur smacked him with the letter.  
"发生了什么事？" 克劳利问道，接着哈斯特用信件狠狠地打了他一下，他发出了一声“哎呀”。

"When did you plan on tellin' me?" the senior demon grunted.  
“你打算什么时候告诉我？”老牛鬼嘟囔着说道。

"Soon enough," said Crowley bristly, turning back to Aziraphale as the angel sat down in his chair again. "So what was that about? I thought we'd be through with old Agnes."  
“很快就会知道的，”克劳利咄咄逼人地说着，转身回到阿齐拉费尔身边，而天使则重新坐回自己的椅子上。“那是怎么回事？我以为我们已经和老阿格尼丝搞定了。”

Aziraphale flexed his hands in thought.  
亚齐拉费尔思考着，握紧了双手。

"It would seem she still had a few surprises waiting for...," He paused, mumbling for a moment. "Everyone, I'd suspect."  
似乎她还有一些等待着的惊喜……"他停顿了一下，嘟囔了一会儿。“对每个人来说，我猜。”

Hastur turned his head, looking tired of it all.  
哈斯特转过头，看起来对这一切感到厌倦。

"So, them two o' you up to prevent the next Apocalypse?"  
"那么，你们两个是要阻止下一次启示录吗？"

"I don't believe this is about another attempt at ending the world," said Aziraphale.  
“我不相信这是又一次试图毁灭世界的企图，”阿齐拉费尔说道。

"What then?" Crowley chimed in, side-eyeing the chameleon clamber up his arm again and hop behind the sofa. He looked at Ligur. "Is it supposed to do that?"  
“那又怎样？”克劳利插话道，斜眼看着变色龙再次爬上他的手臂，然后跳到沙发后面。他看着利古尔。“它应该这样做吗？”

The former demon shrugged. "Am still figuring out what 'xactly it even is, dun ask me."  
那个前恶魔耸了耸肩。“我还在琢磨它到底是什么，别问我。”

That was as good an answer as Crowley could hope for. He turned back to Aziraphale. "I mean, it's Agnes Nutter, for Wilde's sake. If it's not another Apocalypse, what then?"  
那是克劳利能够期望到的最好的答案了。他转身对阿齐拉费尔说道：“我的意思是，这可是阿格尼丝·纳特，天哪。如果不是另一次启示，那还有什么呢？”

"Probably something worse," Hastur supplied, all helpfully, before looking at Aziraphale. "So, cards on the table. What did you talk about?"  
“可能是更糟糕的事情。”哈斯特尔友好地补充道，然后看向阿齐拉费尔。“所以，坦诚相见。你们谈了什么？”

"Got yer halo in a twist," Ligur added, and Aziraphale let out a long sigh.  
"把你的光环给扭曲了，"利古尔补充道，而阿齐拉费尔长长地叹了口气。

"Alright," he began. "So, Miss Bolton, that's the lady who called, has recently moved to Tadfield."  
"好的，"他开始说道。"所以，Bolton小姐，就是那位打电话来的女士，最近搬到了Tadfield。"

All sounds in the room seemed to screech to a hold as everyone stared at Aziraphale.  
所有房间里的声音似乎都突然停止了，每个人都盯着阿齐拉费尔。

"You're kidding," said Crowley, finding his voice again first.  
克劳利重新找回了声音，说道：“你在开玩笑吧。”

"I am as surprised as you are, my dear."  
亲爱的，我和你一样惊讶。

"Oh, c'mon!" Crowley cried out, messing up his hair in despair. "Why that place again? What's so special about it?"  
"哎呀，拜托！" 克劳利绝望地乱抓着头发喊道。"为什么又是那个地方？有什么特别的地方吗？"

Aziraphale blinked. 亚齐拉费尔眨了眨眼睛。

"Well, the Antichrist lives there."  
嗯，那里住着反基督。

"... Yeah, I know... but..." Crowley snapped his mouth shut, deflated.  
“是的，我知道……但是……”克劳利噤声，灰心丧气地闭上了嘴巴。

"Anyway," Aziraphale started anew. "It would appear she had moved there a while ago, and by yesterday has come into the possession of a hitherto unknown book by Agnes Nutter. Which, apparently had been addressed to Miss Bolton explicitly."  
“不管怎样，”亚齐拉费尔重新开始说道。“看起来她一段时间前就搬到那里了，而且昨天她得到了一本迄今为止未知的阿格尼丝·纳特的书。显然这本书是专门寄给博尔顿小姐的。”

Ligur reached over and tugged on Crowley's sleeve to get his attention.  
利古尔伸手过去，拽了拽克劳利的袖子，以引起他的注意。

"It's absolutely the proper Apocalypse," he said once he'd gotten it.  
“这绝对是适当的末日，”他在理解后说道。

Crowley, out of habitual spite, shook his head.  
克劳利出于习惯性的恶意，摇了摇头。

"Don't think so." 不这么想。

"In any case," said Aziraphale pointedly. "Miss Bolton has agreed to come here on the weekend and bring the book with her."  
“无论如何，”阿齐拉费尔有意地说道。“博尔顿小姐已经同意在周末过来，并带着那本书。”

"Well," Crowley sighed. "At least it'll be easier to get the book this time 'round."  
“唉，”克劳利叹了口气。“这次至少取书会容易些。”

~⧖~

"Ah, Michael, glad you could come."  
"啊，迈克尔，很高兴你能来。"

There was a tone in Gabriel's voice that made it clear that he was aware of how awkward and pointless a greeting it was, but that he had said it to keep his mind from just flipping a table.  
加布里埃尔的声音中带着一种语气，清楚地表明他意识到这个问候是多么尴尬和无意义，但他说出来是为了让自己不要发疯。

"Your summon sounded more urgent than usual," said Michael. "What did Aziraphale do now?"  
"你的召唤听起来比平常更紧急，"迈克尔说道。"亚齐拉费尔现在又做了什么？"

Gabriel blinked. 加布里埃尔眨了眨眼睛。

"Nothing so far. It'd seem he's doing well."  
目前还没有什么消息。看起来他过得不错。

"Which is a shame," Sandalphon added helpfully. "He could have gotten rid of the demon assigned as his supervisor."  
"这真是遗憾，"桑达尔冯乐于助人地补充道。"他本可以摆脱那个被指派为他主管的恶魔。"

Gabriel nodded enthusiastically. "Yes. It's a shame, really. But I'm positive he will come to his senses sooner or later."  
加布里埃尔热情地点了点头。“是的。真是可惜。但我相信他迟早会醒悟过来。”

Michael snorted. 迈克尔哼了一声。

"Yes?" asked Gabriel, looking a little baffled at that reaction.  
"什么事？" 加百列问道，对那种反应感到有些困惑。

"Nothing of relevance," said Michael, crossing her arms. "You didn't summon me here to discuss what Aziraphale might do to Hastur or vice versa. And if nothing happened yet, I don't know..."  
"没什么相关的事情，"迈克尔说着，双臂交叉在胸前。"你召唤我来这里不是为了讨论阿齐拉费尔可能对哈斯特尔做什么，或者反过来。而且如果还没有发生任何事情，我不知道……"

"Have you had any success in locating the surplus angel?"  
你有没有成功找到多余的天使？

Michael glared daggers at Sandalphon for interrupting her.  
迈克尔怒视桑达尔芬，因为她打断了她的话。

"Don't you think I'd have come on my own if I had?"  
如果我能自己来的话，你难道不觉得我早就来了吗？

Sandalphon harrumphed, and Michael looked back at Gabriel.  
桑达尔冯嗤之以鼻，迈克尔回头看了加百列一眼。

"And I assume you had no luck either?"  
"我猜你也没有运气吧？"

Gabriel shook his head. 加布里埃尔摇了摇头。

"Not yet. Uriel is trying to get a hold of Raphael still."  
还没有。Uriel还在努力联系Raphael。

Michael nodded. 迈克尔点了点头。

"You think this has to do with Pestilence resurfacing?"  
你觉得这与瘟疫再次出现有关吗？

Again Gabriel shook his head.  
加布里埃尔再次摇了摇头。

"It might be, it might not be. You know Her ways are..."  
可能是，也可能不是。你知道她的方式是...

"Yes, yes," said Michael, with a soft frown. "Gabriel, you didn't summon me into a meeting such as this for smalltalk."  
"是的，是的，"迈克尔轻轻皱眉说道。"加百列，你不会把我召集到这样的会议中来闲聊吧。"

"Certainly not. Well, without further ado..." Gabriel looked the other Archangel dead in the eyes. "I can count on your secrecy?"  
当然不会。好了，废话不多说……"加百列直视另一位大天使的眼睛说道："我能信任你的保密吗？"

Michael wrinkled her nose.  
迈克尔皱了皱鼻子。

"Of course you can." 当然可以。

"We lost track of Lucifer."  
我们失去了对路西法的踪迹。

Michael opened her mouth and stared at the other two angels.  
迈克尔张开嘴巴，盯着另外两个天使。

She snapped her mouth shut.  
她猛地闭上了嘴巴。

"This, obviously does not bode well," said Sandalphon, leaning towards Michael as if he worried Michael might not hear him otherwise. "And as the Morningstar is your..."  
“显然，这不是个好兆头。”桑达尔芬说着，身体向迈克尔倾斜，仿佛担心迈克尔听不到他的话。“而且作为晨星的你的…”

Michael waved him off, rather irritated, fixing Gabriel with a glare.  
迈克尔不耐烦地挥了挥手，用怒视盯着加百利。

"Is this some kind of joke?"  
这是什么玩笑吗？

"I'd never joke about this. Especially not to you, Michael."  
我绝对不会拿这个开玩笑，尤其不会对你，迈克尔。

"Appreciated. But that's impossible."  
感谢。但那是不可能的。

"I know." Gabriel sighed heavily. "But I believe Hell has been working on means to get the upper hand over us."  
"我知道。"加百列沉重地叹了口气。“但我相信地狱一直在努力寻找方法来占据上风。”

"And you think they found a way to hide Lucifer's whereabouts?"  
"你觉得他们找到了一种方法来隐藏路西法的行踪吗？"

"Indeed," Sandalphon supplied helpfully. "And should they have managed that, their next step, undoubtedly, would be to find a way to let him roam Earth."  
"确实,"桑达尔芬乐于提供帮助地说道。"而且如果他们成功了，毫无疑问，他们的下一步将是找到一种让他在地球上自由行动的方法。"

Michael grimaced. 迈克尔皱了皱眉。

"I shall see about this."  
我会处理这件事的。

"Good," said Gabriel, a worried look crossing his face for a moment. "You certainly understand we ought to keep this secret until we know what's going on?"  
"好的，" 加布里埃尔说道，脸上一瞬间闪过一丝担忧的表情。"你肯定明白我们应该保守这个秘密，直到我们弄清楚发生了什么吗？"

Michael looked at him sharply.  
迈克尔瞪了他一眼。

"You mean leave everyone else in the dark? Gabriel, Uriel and Raphael are down there alone."  
你的意思是让其他人一无所知吗？加百列、乌列尔和拉斐尔都在那里孤身一人。

"And Uriel is a capable fighter. Should you cross paths, get back to me about the further procedure. Otherwise I expect you to look into this without involving anyone else. I know you are more than capable of doing this alone."  
"乌里尔是一名有能力的战士。如果你们相遇了，请告诉我后续的程序。否则，我希望你能独自调查此事，不要牵扯其他人。我知道你完全有能力独自完成这件事。"

Michael huffed. 迈克尔咕哝了一声。

"Of course." 当然。

She nodded stoically and left the office.  
她坚定地点了点头，离开了办公室。

In the room, Sandalphon turned to Gabriel.  
在房间里，桑达尔冯转向加百列。

"With all due respect... I know the other rumor is more than likely false - shame on Raziel and the angels spreading them - but... can we still trust Michael?"  
恕我直言...我知道另一个谣言很可能是假的 - Raziel和天使们传播这些谣言真是可耻 - 但是...我们还能相信迈克尔吗？

Gabriel blinked, looking shocked for the fraction of a second. Then he smiled a little too cheerfully.  
加布里埃尔眨了眨眼，露出了一瞬间的惊讶表情。然后他过于开心地微笑了一下。

"Of course we can. Michael's an angel."  
当然可以。迈克尔是个天使。

Michael meanwhile scuddled down the staircase, pulling out her phone, dialing.  
与此同时，迈克尔匆匆下了楼梯，拿出手机拨号。

"...Ligur? It's me... We might have a problem."  
"...Ligur？是我...我们可能有麻烦了。"

~⧖~

"So, what do you make of it?" asked Mammon, turning a small medallion between his fingers. He was sitting at the edge of a pool, an eerie, unearthly light (by Hell's standards) coming from thousands of tiny, glowing... things illuminating the place.  
“那么，你对此有何看法？”麦蒙问道，他手指间转动着一枚小小的徽章。他坐在一个池塘边缘，成千上万的微小发光物散发出一种诡异而超凡的光芒（按照地狱的标准来说）。

This was Leviathan's domain.  
这是利维坦的领域。

An In-between like the Phantasmagoetia, just a little less twisted. Maybe. And just like Belphegor, Leviathan was rather hard to get a hold of. Usually they were moping around somewhere in the labyrinthine tunnels beneath the water's surface.  
一个介于幻影术和恶魔学之间的存在，只是稍微不那么扭曲。也许吧。就像贝尔菲戈一样，利维坦也很难捉摸。通常它们都在水面下的迷宫般的隧道中游荡。

"Not much," Leviathan responded in a grumble, two sets of brightly colored fish eyes fixed on Mammon.  
"不多," 利维坦嘟囔着回答，两对明亮的鱼眼盯着玛门。

"Well, you do keep finding these in your pools," said Mammon.  
“嗯，你总是在你的泳池里找到这些东西。”Mammon说道。

"And you take them. Give it back."  
"你拿走它们。还回来。"

"Will not do," Mammon said, humorless. "The Master wants to be informed about all unusual occurrences, and -and I believe you will agree- this is most unusual."  
“不行。”玛门说道，没有丝毫幽默感。“主人希望对所有不寻常的事情都能得到通报，而且——我相信你会同意——这确实非常不寻常。”

Leviathan nodded curtly. 利维坦干脆地点了点头。

"I guess." 我猜。

Mammon flashed them a winning smile.  
麦蒙向他们露出了一个迷人的微笑。

"So, you do not have an idea what these are?"  
"那么，你不知道这些是什么吗？"

"Do you?" 你呢？

Mammon just shrugged, smiling a little too cheerful. He took too much delight in getting the Archdemon of Envy riled up not only by taking away the trinkets that recently began winding up in Leviathan's den, but mostly by hinting to know something Leviathan did not.  
玛门只是耸了耸肩，笑得有些过于开心。他非常喜欢让嫉妒魔王生气，不仅仅是通过拿走最近出现在利维坦巢穴中的小玩意儿，更是通过暗示自己知道利维坦不知道的事情。

Leviathan let out a snarl, the clear and endlessly deep water starting to ripple ominously.  
利维坦发出一声咆哮，清澈而无尽深邃的水面开始不安地泛起涟漪。

"Oh, no need to get all upset," said Mammon, pocketing the trinket. "I shall bring this where it needs to be brought."  
“哦，没必要这么生气。”玛门说着，将小饰品装进口袋。“我会把它送到该去的地方。”

Another snarl and Leviathan dove. Mammon laughed darkly and rose.🔄  ❓

"You will inform me should you find more unusual things," he called, knowing the other Archdemon would hear him. "It is almost a shame you barely ever leave the pool."  
"如果你发现更多不寻常的事情，记得告诉我，"他喊道，知道另一个大恶魔会听到他的话。"真是有点可惜，你几乎从不离开那个池子。"

With that, Mammon headed out of the cavern.  
说完这句话，魔王马门离开了洞穴。

In the shadows, Leviathan rose out of the water, form slowly shifting. When all was said and done, Leviathan stretched their gaunt figure and rubbed their face, sole set of eyes they had now blinking.  
在阴影中，利维坦从水中升起，形态逐渐变化。一切都说完了，利维坦伸展了瘦削的身躯，揉了揉脸，他们现在唯一的一双眼睛眨了眨。

Then they leaned over the water to look at their reflection.  
然后他们俯身在水面上看着自己的倒影。

Leviathan nodded grimly but satisfied at what they saw, turned and glared at the entrance.  
利维坦面带严肃的点了点头，满意地看着眼前的景象，然后转身怒视着入口。

"Wrong on all accounts, asshole."  
你完全错了，混蛋。

~⧖~

Miss Mag stretched and let out a soft, satisfied sigh. With the call made, dirty clothes in the machine and the table cleaned she could finally go about her daily business.  
麦格小姐伸了个懒腰，满足地轻轻叹了口气。电话打完了，脏衣服放进洗衣机，桌子也擦干净了，她终于可以开始日常事务了。

Bills don't pay themselves, after all.\*\*  
毕竟，账单不会自己付款。

\*\*Unless you are Crowley, naturally. And then only if you actually let them come into existence.  
除非你是克劳利，当然了。而且只有在你真的让它们存在的情况下。

She sat down to get some reading done, but found her eyes continuously flitted back to Agnes' book.  
她坐下来准备读书，但发现自己的目光不断地飘向了阿格尼丝的书。

'When Two are Four and Four are Five, mark my words: The Deville doth not know Wonne of Seven is not Wonne of Six. And when the false Serpent follows the gleam of fool's gold the rightful one shall find my words in the King's house.'  
当两个等于四，四个等于五时，记住我的话：Deville不知道七的Wonne不是六的Wonne。当虚假的蛇追随愚人的金光时，正当的人将在国王的宫殿中找到我的话。

"Well, that's more of a mathematical problem than anything, innit, Miss Nutter?" mumbled Miss Mag, shaking her head. She had figured that Agnes seemed to just string random words together, but Miss Mag was used to that, what with being a freelance proofreader.  
“嗯，那更像是个数学问题，不是吗，纳特小姐？” 麦格小姐嘟囔着，摇了摇头。她发现阿格尼丝似乎只是随意串联一些词语，但麦格小姐对此已经习以为常了，毕竟她是一名自由校对员。

And all things considered, Agnes' prophecies made a lot more sense than some of the material Miss Mag got paid for to read. Miss Mag cracked her knuckles and focused on her work again, occasionally looking up and out the windows.  
综合考虑，阿格尼丝的预言比玛格小姐为之付费阅读的一些材料更有道理。玛格小姐咔嗒咔嗒地弄响了手指关节，然后重新专注于工作，偶尔抬头望向窗外。

The kitchen windows opened to a wonderful view over the small, lush garden and the street beyond the fence, and a stretch of meadow, the gigantic fallen-over willow and the small river that flowed by the cottage.  
厨房的窗户打开后，可以看到一个美妙的景色，小而郁郁葱葱的花园和篱笆外的街道，还有一片草地、倒下的巨大柳树和流过小屋旁的小河。

It was a calming, beautiful view, even though Miss Mag was still not entirely certain if there had been a stream when she first moved here.  
尽管玛格小姐仍然不确定她搬到这里时是否有一条小溪，但这是一个宁静而美丽的景色。

**A different Tadfield Airbase - the Saturday of an Armageddon-yet-to-happen  
一个不同的塔德菲尔德空军基地 - 一个尚未发生的世界末日的星期六**

"Let them leave," said Adam, pointing at the duo.  
亚当指着那对人说：“让他们离开。”

"I beg your pardon," said Beelzebub, cocking his head.  
“请原谅，”贝尔塞巴博说着，歪着头。

"This is a bad world," said Adam. "It's not worth saving. And it's not worth fighting for either."  
亚当说：“这是一个糟糕的世界。它不值得拯救，也不值得为之奋斗。”

"Young man," said the Metatron, trying to follow the statement. "I can't follow. You just single-handedly destroyed the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, yet you seem out to start the End of the World after all."  
“年轻人，”梅塔特隆说着，试图理解这番话。“我跟不上了。你刚刚独自摧毁了四骑士，可现在看起来你似乎要引发世界末日。”

"I wanted to talk to you first. Let them go. They tried their best. You want the end of the world, fine. But you'll let them go in peace."  
我想先和你谈谈。让他们走吧。他们已经尽力了。你想要世界末日，好吧。但你会让他们安心离开。

"There is be no plasze to go," said Beelzebub.  
贝尔塞巴卜说道：“没有地方可去。”

"Yes there is," Adam insisted and looked back at the other angel and demon duo again. They looked ragged, exhausted and scared.  
"是的，有的，" 亚当坚持道，再次回头看着另外一对天使和恶魔。他们看起来疲惫不堪，筋疲力尽，充满恐惧。

Beelzebub waved Metatron to talk in private for a moment.  
贝利泽布让梅塔特隆私下谈话一会儿。

When they turned back to Adam, they both nodded.  
当他们转身回到亚当身边时，他们俩都点了点头。

"Wherever you will szend them, we will pick them up after the war."  
无论你把他们送到哪里，战后我们都会去接他们。

Then Adam waved his hand and something like a negative light engulfed the duo in question. He smiled at Beelzebub and Metatron.  
然后亚当挥了挥手，一道类似负面光芒笼罩住了这对人物。他对着贝利亚和梅塔特隆微笑着。

"You won't," he said with pity in his voice, and turned back to the other supernatural duo. "Good luck, and thank you for everything you did."  
“你不会的。”他带着怜悯的声音说道，然后转身回到另外一对超自然存在身边。“祝你们好运，并感谢你们所做的一切。”

The lower demon smiled at Adam, then at the angel at his side.  
那个下等恶魔朝亚当微笑了一下，然后又看了看他身边的天使。

"Nice knowing you, my dear," he said and held out his hand.  
他说：“很高兴认识你，亲爱的。”他伸出手来。

"Here's to the next time," said the angel, taking it just as the unlight swallowed them.  
“祝下次再见，”天使说着，就在黑暗吞噬他们的时候接过了。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

"There's really a lot of animals out today," Brian observed, watching the third hedgehog the Them had seen on their way to their little hideout scamper into the undergrowth. Above, a whole murder of crows called from the branches and just minutes ago Pepper had spotted a fox. She insisted it had looked at Adam in reverence.  
"今天真的有很多动物呢，"布莱恩观察着，看着第三只刺猬在他们前往藏身之处的路上匆匆跑进灌木丛中。在上方，一群乌鸦从树枝上叫个不停，就在几分钟前，佩珀还发现了一只狐狸。她坚称那只狐狸看着亚当时带着敬畏之情。

"My parents would go into hysterics if they knew about this," Wensley added.  
文斯利补充道：“如果我父母知道这件事，他们会大发脾气的。”

"We've all gotten our shots," said Pepper. "So unless one of the frogs is gonna eat us we'll be fine." Then she seemed to remember something. "Oh, by the way..."  
"我们都打了疫苗，"Pepper说道。"所以除非有只青蛙要吃我们，我们应该没事。"然后她似乎想起了什么。"哦，顺便说一下..."

The rest of the Them stopped. When Pepper said something like that, it usually meant some interesting news.  
其他人停下了。当Pepper说出这样的话时，通常意味着有一些有趣的消息。

"Mum said to stay away from Mr. Nicholas' friend."  
妈妈说要远离尼古拉斯先生的朋友。

"His friend?" Said Adam, crossing his arms. "Didn't know he had one."  
"他的朋友？" 亚当双臂交叉地说道，"我不知道他有朋友。"

Pepper shrugged. "Mum's not certain either. But some odd guy asked her about Mr Nicholas earlier, and she said they were really creepy. Mr. De Witte, or something."  
Pepper耸了耸肩。“妈妈也不确定。但是有个奇怪的家伙之前问她关于尼古拉斯先生的事情，她说他们真的很可怕。德维特先生，或者什么的。”

Brian grimaced. "Urgh, you mean that zombie guy?"  
布莱恩皱了皱眉头。“呃，你是说那个僵尸人？”

Pepper nodded. 胡椒点了点头。

"They don't look like a zombie," said Wensley. "Zombies would have exposed muscles and parts falling off. Mr. De Witte looks more like a victim of consumption."  
"他们看起来不像僵尸，" 温斯利说道。"僵尸应该会有暴露的肌肉和脱落的部分。德维特先生更像是一个消耗病的受害者。"

"Naw," said Brian. "They don't look like they ate anything at all. What do you think, Adam?"  
"不会吧，"布莱恩说道。"它们看起来一点东西都没吃。你觉得呢，亚当？"

Adam snapped out of whatever he was thinking about.  
亚当从他正在思考的事情中清醒过来。

"Sorry, I wasn't listening... It's..." he looked around, the faintest trace of worry crossing his face.  
抱歉，我没在听... 是... 他四处张望，脸上掠过一丝担忧的痕迹。

"Adam, you okay?" asked Pepper.  
"亚当，你还好吗？"佩珀问道。

Dog shuffled closer to his master, whining at the odd humming in the air.  
狗儿靠近主人，对空气中奇怪的嗡嗡声发出哀鸣。

"Hey!" someone called, and the Them spun around as one.  
“嘿！”有人喊道，他们一起转身。

Miss Mag came towards them, sending leaves flying as she made her way through the forest.  
麦格小姐朝他们走来，她穿过森林时，飞舞的树叶随之而起。

The kids waved. 孩子们挥手。

"Hi, Miss Mag. Whatcha doing here?" said Adam as Miss Mag reached them.  
“嗨，Mag小姐。你在这里干嘛呢？”当Mag小姐走到他们面前时，亚当问道。

"You like odd stuff, right?" said Miss Mag.  
"你喜欢奇怪的东西，对吗？" 麦格小姐说道。

The Them looked at each other, then at Miss Mag, and nodded.  
他们相互看了看，然后看向麦格小姐，点了点头。

Miss Mag might not have been a witch like Miss Anathema, but nevertheless did she have something exciting about her. She had the oddest, spookiest stories to tell from around the world, and the Them were certain some of the knickknacks in Miss Mag's possession were definitely magical.  
麦格小姐可能不像阿纳塞玛小姐那样是个女巫，但她身上确实有一些令人兴奋的东西。她有着最奇怪、最恐怖的世界各地故事，而他们确信麦格小姐的一些小玩意儿肯定是有魔力的。

Miss Mag reached for her satchel and produced a really old book.  
麦格小姐伸手拿起她的背包，拿出一本非常古老的书。

"Have any of you ever heard of a certain Agnes Nutter?"  
你们当中有人听说过一个叫阿格尼丝·纳特的人吗？

~⧖~

"You _know_ that's a bad idea, angel," sneered the smaller one, leaning back on the bed.  
你知道那是个糟糕的主意，天使，"小个子嘲笑着说，靠在床上。

The other rolled his eyes.  
另一个人翻了个白眼。

"Phelan, please. They have a right to know," he said, putting away the most recent letter that had found its way to their little hideout.  
"Phelan，请。他们有权知道，"他说着，将最近收到的一封信收起来，这封信找到了他们的小藏身之处。

The smaller one, Phelan, frowned darkly.  
小一点的菲兰皱起了深深的眉头。

"And blow the sole chance we have? Really?"  
"而且就这样错失我们唯一的机会吗？真的吗？"

"That's not how it will end. You've seen them. They... If they..."  
这不是它的结局。你已经见过他们。他们...如果他们...

Phelan got up and grabbed the other by the arms.  
菲兰站起身来，抓住了对方的胳膊。

"This place is different. Maybe we won't die, but... How do you think they'll react to such news? You've heard..."  
这个地方不一样。也许我们不会死，但是...你觉得他们会对这样的消息有什么反应？你听说过...

"Oh, for crying out loud," the other snapped. "Listen, Phelan. He has some beef with both of them, and I..."  
"哎呀，别闹了，"另一个人厉声说道。"听着，费兰。他对他们俩都有意见，而且我..."

Phelan let out a heavy sigh and let go of the other's arms.  
菲兰沉重地叹了口气，松开了对方的手臂。

"You're worried, I appreciate that. But still... Let's at least wait till we receive a follow up to that letter, alright?"  
你很担心，我理解。但是...至少让我们等到收到那封信的后续再说，好吗？

The other squirmed. 其他的人扭动了一下。

"I really don't know..." 我真的不知道...

"Keruvael," Phelan said solemnly. "For how long have we been friends? 6000 years. Have I ever done anything to make you think you can't trust me?"  
"Keruvael," Phelan solemnly said. "我们已经是朋友多久了？6000年。我有做过任何事情让你觉得不能信任我吗？"

Keruvael cocked his head in the most are-you-kidding-me manner possible.  
克鲁瓦尔以最为不可思议的方式歪了一下头。

"Do you want the list chronological?"  
你想要按时间顺序排列的列表吗？

Phelan harrumphed. 菲兰哼了一声。

"Oh fine, fine. But... what makes you think this whole deal now would go on the list?"  
好吧，好吧。但是...你为什么觉得现在这整个交易会被列入清单呢？

"6000 years of experience," Keruvael said dryly.  
"六千年的经验，" Keruvael干巴巴地说道。

"You are, without a doubt, the rudest angel in all the choirs," responded Phelan, equally as dry, with a smirk tugging on his lips.  
菲兰同样干巴巴地回答道：“毫无疑问，你是所有合唱团中最粗鲁的天使。”他嘴角勾起一丝嘲弄的笑容。

Keruvael quirked a brow. 克鲁瓦尔挑了挑眉毛。

"You don't know that," he said, all scholarly and thoroughly innocent. "They have nine here."  
“你不知道，”他说道，一本正经地、彻底地无辜地说道，“这里有九个。”

~⧖~

Hastur was in a rotten mood.  
哈斯特心情糟透了。

"Can't believe he gone dun that," he said after Ligur and Crowley had left again. All just cause bloody wank-wings called and said 'Jump!'.  
“他竟然做了那种事，真不敢相信。”Ligur和Crowley再次离开后，他说道。全都是因为那些该死的自以为是的家伙打电话来说：“跳吧！”

"Still being all buddy-buddies with..."  
仍然和...保持着亲密无间的关系...

"You don't know that," Aziraphale said, sorting books into the shelves. "For all you know it might have been pure business. He _is_ an angel now, after all."  
“你不知道这件事，”阿齐拉费尔边整理书籍边说道。“你只是猜测它可能只是纯粹的商业行为。毕竟，他现在是个天使。”

Hastur was quiet for a moment before letting out a howl of despair.  
哈斯特沉默了片刻，然后发出一声绝望的嚎叫。

"So what? If Gabriel would come callin' tellin' you to meet him, would you really..."  
那又怎样？如果加布里埃尔来找你，让你去见他，你真的会去吗？

"No." Aziraphale gave a determined nod. "But this is Ligur and Michael we are speaking about. Not Gabriel and myself."  
“不。”亚齐拉费尔坚定地点了点头。“但我们现在谈论的是利古尔和迈克尔，而不是加百列和我自己。”

Hastur glared at him darkly.  
哈斯特尔阴沉地瞪着他。

"Shut up." 闭嘴。

That was the best he could say. Because what else was there?  
那是他能说的最好的了。因为还有什么其他的呢？

That  he feared losing Ligur again? He'd be blessed to tell that to an angel. To Crowley's angel at that.  
他害怕再次失去利古尔吗？他真希望能对一个天使说出这句话。尤其是克劳利的天使。

That he worried Ligur had picked Michael over him? Possibly cause Ligur blamed him for the Holy Water thing? Or because Ligur likely sensed that Hastur couldn't pull himself together and say what was on his mind since they met again?  
他担心Ligur选择了Michael而不是他？可能是因为Ligur怪罪他关于圣水的事情？或者因为Ligur可能感觉到Hastur无法整理自己的思绪，无法表达自己的心意自从他们再次见面以来？

"You haven't told him yet?" Aziraphale interupted, sounding alarmed, and Hastur looked up at the angel with equal alarm and even more confusion.  
"你还没告诉他吗？" 阿齐拉费尔惊慌地打断道，哈斯特抬头看着天使，同样感到惊慌，甚至更加困惑。

"Wot?" "什么？"

"You mumbled a few things about Ligur and Michael."  
你嘟囔了一些关于利古尔和迈克尔的事情。

Hastur narrowed his eyes for a moment, and then let out a high-pitch screeching wail.  
哈斯特一瞬间眯起了眼睛，然后发出了一声尖锐的尖叫。

With a mucky poof he turned into a full frog form and crawled under one of the pillows.  
他发出一声咕噜，变成了一只完整的青蛙形态，爬到了一个枕头下面。

"Do you often say out loud what you are musing about?" asked Aziraphale, equal parts casual and unimpressed.  
“你经常会大声说出你在思考的事情吗？”阿齐拉费尔问道，既随意又不为所动。

"Shurrup. None of yer business. Leave me alone."  
闭嘴。不关你的事。别烦我。

Aziraphale kneeled down and lifted the pillow a little.  
亚齐拉费尔跪下来，轻轻地抬起枕头。

"It's a stress thing, am I correct?"  
这是一种压力问题，我说得对吗？

"It's none of yer business," Hastur growled, turning his back at Aziraphale. "You can call the flash bastard an' tell'im he can do the thing alone."  
“这不关你的事，”哈斯特咆哮着，转过身背对着阿齐拉费尔。“你可以给那个混蛋打个电话，告诉他他可以自己去做那件事。”

Aziraphale frowned and sat down on the couch, taking away the pillow with more vigor than necessary.  
亚齐拉费尔皱了皱眉头，坐在沙发上，用比必要更大的力气拿走了枕头。

"Oh, that will not be possible. Crowley has already mused about asking you to see to this dreadful endeavor on your own."  
哦，那是不可能的。克劳利已经考虑过让你自己负责这个可怕的任务了。

Hastur made a growling noise and leapt into Aziraphale's lap, staring up at him.  
哈斯特发出了一声低吼，跳到了阿齐拉费尔的膝盖上，仰视着他。

"Has he now?" he popped back into his human form, straddling Aziraphale in the most unsexiest manner possible\*. "Well, he can stick that notion somewhere I'll rip him a new one of if he's ought t' be like that."  
"他现在这样了吗？"他突然变回人形，以最不性感的方式跨坐在阿齐拉费尔身上。"嗯，他可以把那个想法塞到我会给他开个新口子的地方，如果他真的想那样的话。"

\*A statement that doesn't even take into account that the skin on his face and neck took a good deal longer to knit itself back into shape than the rest of him.  
这种说法甚至没有考虑到他脸部和颈部的皮肤恢复形状所需的时间比其他部位更长。

With a, albeit slightly amused, frown, Aziraphale crossed his arms upon finding there wasn't much of anywhere else to put them right now.  
阿齐拉费尔微微皱眉，虽然有点好笑，但他还是双臂交叉，因为他发现现在没有其他地方可以放它们了。

"As much as I'd appreciate both of you leaving that poor soul alone..." he began, but Hastur let out a guttural laugh.  
"尽管我很感激你们两个都离开那个可怜的灵魂……"他开始说，但哈斯特尔发出了一声喉咙般的笑声。

"Y'know, I don't like jokes, but that was a good one, Principality. You know there's nothin' to save when someone's up to get dragged to Hell." Smoothly Hastur slipped off the angel's lap. "So, what were you sayin'?"  
你知道的，我不喜欢开玩笑，但那个还不错，Principality。你知道当有人要被拖入地狱时，没有什么可以挽救的。Hastur优雅地从天使的腿上滑落下来。“那么，你刚才说什么来着？”

Aziraphale groaned lightly.  
亚齐拉费尔轻轻地呻吟了一声。

"Nevermind this, dear boy," he said, adjusting his jacket.  
"别在意，亲爱的孩子，" 他说着，整理了一下他的夹克。

Hastur grinned and got up.  
哈斯特尔咧嘴一笑，站了起来。

"Ah, won't hurt if I go an' scout the area." He headed for the door. "I'll be back for dinner. If Crowley comes callin', tell'im he can kiss me arse."  
"啊，我去侦查一下周围也不会有什么损失。"他朝门口走去。“晚饭时我会回来的。如果克劳利来找我，告诉他可以亲我屁股。”

And he was gone. 他走了。

Aziraphale let out a long sorrowful sigh. It didn't matter that Hastur was a demon. With a sense of despair and agony this strong, everyone would feel it. He wasn't fooling anyone in the shop.  
亚齐拉费尔长长地叹了口气，充满悲伤。哈斯特虽然是个恶魔，但这种绝望和痛苦的感觉如此强烈，任何人都能感受到。他并没有在店里欺骗任何人。

~⧖~

"Tedious. That'd be the word, positively tedious."  
枯燥乏味。那就是个词，绝对枯燥乏味。

The older one, who went by De Witte now, shoved a heap of empty plastic cups, pizza boxes and other assorted junk out of the way and off the bed, laying down.  
年长的那个人，现在叫德维特，把一堆空塑料杯、比萨盒和其他杂乱的垃圾推到一边，然后躺下来。

"What? It's nice?" said the other (who went by Chalky again) with a pout, and gazed around the undeniable mess in the little hotel room.  
“什么？很好？”另一个人（又被称为Chalky）不满地说道，然后环顾了一下这个小旅馆房间里不可否认的混乱。

De Witte blinked. 德维特眨了眨眼睛。

"Oh, not you," they said. "That town."  
"哦，不是你，"他们说道。"是那个城镇。"

"Ah." "啊。"

"6000 years and I never sensed anything like it."  
6000年来，我从未感受过这样的事情。

"We haven't had an Almostcalypse in 6000 years either, though." Chalky stretched, throwing a bouncing ball at the opposite wall and catching it.  
"虽然我们也有6000年没有发生过几乎末日的情况了。" Chalky伸了个懒腰，将一个弹跳球扔向对面的墙壁，然后接住了它。

"Are you trying to crack the wall or are you just annoying the people in the other room?"  
你是想敲墙还是只是在惹恼了隔壁的人？

"Bit of heap A bit of heap B."  
一点堆 A 一点堆 B.

De Witte nodded. 德维特点了点头。

"And what d'ye mean about the town? I mean... the Antichrist lives there... and his little friends... Ouch!"  
“你说的城市是什么意思？我的意思是...那里住着那个反基督...还有他的小伙伴们...哎呀！”

Chalky yelped as the ball hit them square in the forehead.  
粉笔尖叫着，球正中他们的额头。

"Careful there, kiddo." De Witte grinned. "And no, that wasn't it. There's something... something else."  
小心点，小家伙。”德维特咧嘴笑道。“不，那不是全部。还有一些...其他的东西。”

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"I can't put my finger on it... but I don't like it."  
我说不出个所以然，但我不喜欢它。

Chalky pondered. 白垩沉思着。

"Good thing we came here then, even if it was just to see the place," they said, still rubbing their head, before tilting it. "Hey, what's wrong? You haven't looked that worried since Jenner."  
他们说：“还好我们来了这里，即使只是为了看看这个地方。”他们还在揉着头，然后歪着头问道：“嘿，怎么了？自从詹纳以来，你看起来从未那么担心过。”

"I'm trying to remember when I had this feeling before... But..." De Witte shook their head. "I will probably remember soon enough. Care for a stroll?"  
“我在努力回忆我以前有过这种感觉的时候……但是……”德维特摇了摇头。“我很快就会记起来的。想去散散步吗？”

"You know I'm not the 'catch a breath of fresh air' type."  
你知道我不是那种需要“呼吸新鲜空气”的人。

"Well, since when am I?"  
嗯，我从什么时候开始呢？

~⧖~

**London, St James' Park - 6 months after the failed Apocalypse  
伦敦，圣詹姆斯公园——失败的启示录之后的6个月**

"How is he faring?" asked Belphegor as they strolled through a nightly St James' Park.  
“他过得怎么样？”贝尔菲戈问道，他们漫步在夜晚的圣詹姆斯公园。

"Not too well. He keeps pushing himself to exhaustion," said Legion, gazing up at the stars thoughtfully.  
"不太好。他一直把自己逼到筋疲力尽，" 莱吉恩沉思地仰望着星空说道。

"Hastur is stubborn," Belphegor mused, burying her hands in the pockets of her too large vintage coat. "You know him. He has his goal, and he won't stop till he reaches it."  
"哈斯特是个固执的人，"贝尔菲戈沉思着，将双手插进她那件过大的复古外套的口袋里说道。"你了解他。他有自己的目标，不达到目标他是不会停下来的。"

"It won't do if he gets himself to kick the bucket. You should put your foot down, Mistress."  
如果他自己去踢那个桶，那可不行。夫人，你应该坚决反对。

Belphegor shrugged dramatically.  
贝尔菲戈戏剧性地耸了耸肩。

"Too much work. And he knows what he's getting himself into."  
工作太多了。而且他知道自己要承担什么。

Legion nodded. 军团点了点头。

"Duke Valefar really went overboard on him."  
杜克·瓦尔法尔对他真是过分了。

Again Belphegor shrugged.  
贝尔菲戈再次耸了耸肩。

"I agree, but C'est la vie. Hell doesn't go easy on failures. And as Crowley tricked them into thinking he's immune to Holy Water..."  
我同意，但这就是生活。地狱对失败者从不手软。而且克劳利欺骗他们认为他对圣水免疫...

Legion pretty much screeched to a halt.  
军团几乎完全停滞不前。

"What?" 什么？

Belphegor laughed, startling a few nightly creatures.  
贝尔菲戈尔笑了起来，吓了几只夜间的生物。

"I'd have thought you'd have caught on. Crowley and that angel... whatshisface? No pun intended, I can't remember."  
我本以为你会明白的。克劳利和那个天使...叫什么来着？无意冒犯，我记不清了。

"Aziraphale." 阿齐拉费尔。

"That one. They merely shapeshifted into each other's guises. Crowley is as immune to Holy Water as you and I. No wait, that's a bad comparison."  
那个。他们只是互相变换了外貌。克劳利和你我一样对圣水免疫。不，等等，这个比喻不太好。

"Yeah, I mean... you _are_ immune, aren't you?"  
是啊，我是说...你是免疫的，对吧？

"Oh, I just keep forgetting I shouldn't be. And you just lose one copy and take a bit of damage to the others."  
哦，我老是忘记我不应该这样做。而你只是丢失了一份副本，其他的也受到了一些损害。

"It still hurts like anything," Legion murmured, rubbing his arm. Then he grinned. "Hah! I was right."  
"还是疼得要命，" 莱吉恩喃喃自语着，揉着他的胳膊。然后他咧嘴一笑，说道："哈！我是对的。"

"Were you?" 你是吗？

"Yeah, I thought there was something about the angel that was off. Something about him... 'Twas really weird."  
是的，我觉得那个天使有点不对劲。有什么地方让我感觉奇怪。

"It must have taken them a lot of energy to mask their eyes."  
他们一定花了很多精力来掩饰他们的眼神。

Legion made an odd noise somewhere between a snort and a wince.  
军团发出了一种介于哼声和畏缩之间的奇怪声音。

"Hastur will make snake kebab out of Crowley when he finds out."  
当Hastur发现后，他会把Crowley做成蛇肉串。

"Oh, I'd wager he already knows."  
哦，我敢打赌他已经知道了。

"Huh?" Legion blinked, startled.  
"嗯？" 莱吉恩瞪大眼睛，吃了一惊。

"Maybe not for certain, but he had enough time to think about things. Hastur's very clever if one lets him see to the facts."  
或许不是确定的，但他有足够的时间来思考事情。如果有人让哈斯图尔看到事实，他非常聪明。

Legion scratched his neck.  
军团挠了挠脖子。

"I could ask him, he just woke up."  
我可以问他，他刚刚醒来。

~⧖~

**Purgatory - 6 months after the failed Apocalypse and immediately after what you just read  
炼狱——失败的启示录之后的6个月，以及你刚刚阅读的内容之后**

Hastur stirred, peeling an eye open with a low growl.  
哈斯特醒来，低声咆哮着睁开一只眼睛。

6000 years, and he had never once slept as much as he had in the past four months. Then again, he never had his body and soul chipped away to near nothingness until half a year ago.  
6000年来，他从未像过去四个月那样睡得这么多。然而，半年前他的身体和灵魂几乎被削弱到了虚无。

He groaned and rolled over on the little bed that had been his for the past few months. Since Belphegor had found him and patched him back together.  
他呻吟着，在过去几个月里一直是他的小床上翻了个身。自从贝尔菲戈尔找到他并把他修补好之后。

"Slept well, Your Disgrace?" a voice called, and Hastur turned, glaring weakly at Legion.  
“睡得好吗，您的尊贵？”有人喊道，哈斯特转过身来，虚弱地瞪着军团。

"Told you t'stop callin' me that," he scowled. "They took everything from me, remember?"  
“我告诉过你别再叫我那个名字了。”他皱着眉头说道。“他们把一切都夺走了，记得吗？”

"Yeah, but that doesn't mean much."  
是的，但那并不意味着很多。

Hastur propped himself up on one elbow.  
哈斯特尔用一只手肘撑起身子。

"I told you I don't like jokes. 'Specially not those wot got me for a punchline."  
我告诉过你，我不喜欢开玩笑。尤其是那些以我为笑柄的。

"'Twasn't a joke. I think Duke Valefar went too far with what he did to you. And," Legion sat down astride the room's sole chair, "I mean just annihilating you would have been one thing. Even with torture beforehand. But what happened..."  
“这不是个玩笑。我觉得维尔法公爵对你所做的事情太过分了。而且，”莱吉恩一跨坐在房间唯一的椅子上，“我是说，仅仅消灭你本来就已经够了。即使在之前进行折磨也是一回事。但发生的事情……"

"Shut up!" Hastur howled, plunging back down onto the bed and pulling the blanket over his head.  
“闭嘴！”哈斯特咆哮着，重新扑倒在床上，把毯子拉过头顶。

It didn't matter how much he was set on revenge or somesuch. He didn't want to think of the time immediately after the failed trial. It was bad enough that it was haunting his dreams. On top of the question why he dreamed to begin with.  
无论他多么渴望报复或其他什么，都无关紧要。他不想去想那次失败的审判之后的时光。令他痛苦的是，这段经历一直在他的梦中萦绕。更让他困惑的是，为什么他会做梦。

"Sorry," Legion said. "抱歉，" 莱吉恩说道。

Hastur frowned and peeked out from under the blanket.  
哈斯特皱了皱眉头，从毯子下面偷偷地探出头来。

"For cryin' out loud, Legion, stop apologisin'. Yer a demon."  
别再道歉了，冥冥，你是个恶魔。

Legion shrugged. 军团耸了耸肩。

"There's no harm in saying 'Sorry'."  
说“对不起”没有什么坏处。

"That's wot I mean." 这就是我想说的。

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"What?" 什么？

"Oh. I meant there's neither good nor bad coming of me saying 'Sorry'."  
哦，我的意思是我说“对不起”既没有好的也没有坏的结果。

Hastur nodded curtly. 哈斯特短暂地点了点头。

"Still. Yer too bloody nice for a demon."  
还是啊，你这个恶魔也太好心了。

"How d'ye mean?" 你是什么意思？

With a drawn-out and pained sigh Hastur sat up.  
哈斯特尔长长地叹了口气，痛苦地坐了起来。

"Ev'ryone else would've taken the bloody chance to take some revenge for all them discorporations. But you just sit there, an' y'patch me back up an' shite. Bloody Heaven. Yer a demon. Show some resentment."  
每个人都会抓住这个机会为所有那些解体事件报仇。但你只是坐在那里，给我缝合伤口，胡说八道。该死的天堂。你是个恶魔。表现出点怨恨吧。

But Legion just shrugged.  
但是军团只是耸了耸肩。

"Naw. I mean, sure some stuff you did was really scary and painful, but all in all, with what people like Mammon and Valefar've been doing..."  
嗯，我的意思是，确实有些你做的事情真的很可怕和痛苦，但总的来说，就像玛蒙和瓦勒法尔这样的人所做的一切...

"Come again?" 再说一遍？

"I keep track of my deaths. Comes with me being me."  
我记录着我死亡的次数。这是因为我就是我。

Hastur quirked a brow. 哈斯特尔挑了挑眉毛。

"You keep track?" 你记得吗？

"Yes. And I can tell you for certain that you discorporated me without the trace of a reason only 9 times."  
是的。而且我可以肯定地告诉你，你无缘无故地将我解体了9次。

Hastur quirked the other brow too.  
哈斯特尔也皱起了另一只眉毛。

"Really? Huh. Guess I _am_ getting old." He wanted to say more when he doubled over, holding his stomach.  
"真的吗？哼。看来我老了。" 他本想说更多，但突然弯腰捂住肚子。

Legion hesitated only a moment (he was, after all, a demon and thus paranoid), but was at his side once it became apparent that this wasn't any sort of trick.  
军团只犹豫了一会儿（毕竟他是个恶魔，因此多疑），但一旦意识到这不是任何伎俩，他立刻站在他的身边。

"What's wrong?" 怎么了？

"Dunno." Hastur held his stomach, breathing heavily. "Hunger, I guess."  
“不知道。”哈斯特捂着肚子，喘着气说道。“大概是饥饿吧。”

Legion fumbled what looked like a pocket watch from his jacket and flipped it open.  
军团从夹克口袋里摸出一只看起来像是怀表的东西，然后翻开它。

It contained darkness where the face should have been. Legion let out a wince.  
它的脸部应该在的地方却是一片黑暗。军团忍不住畏缩了一下。

"Sir, have you been doing more than Lord Belphegor or I know of?"  
先生，您做的事情比贝尔菲戈勋爵或我所知道的还要多吗？

Hastur looked away. 哈斯特转过头去。

"No." 不。

"No?" "不是吗？"

"...maybe. I know Lord Belphegor won't like the sentiment, but I dun wanna waste time t'get back in shape."  
"...也许吧。我知道贝尔菲戈勋爵不会喜欢这种情绪，但我不想浪费时间来恢复身材。"

Legion frowned darkly, snapping the watch shut.  
军团皱了皱眉头，砰地一声合上了手表。

"Congratulations. You did the polar opposite. Your essence's back down at 10%..."  
恭喜。你做了完全相反的事情。你的本质已经降至10%...

**London, St James' Park - Now  
伦敦，圣詹姆斯公园 - 现在**

"Say it," Ligur scowled, not taking his eyes off the pond. Crowley was standing, technically, next to him, both of them waiting for Michael to show up.  
“说吧。”利古尔皱着眉头说道，目不转睛地盯着池塘。克劳利站在他旁边，从技术上讲，他们俩都在等迈克尔出现。

"Say what?" Crowley asked, only half at a loss.  
"什么？" 克劳利只有一半的困惑地问道。

"The bloody 'Lovers' tiff' comment snakin' 'round yer tongue since we left the shop."  
自从我们离开商店以来，那个血腥的“情侣争吵”的评论一直在你的舌头上蔓延。

Crowley drew a sharp breath and looked everywhere but at Ligur.  
克劳利猛地吸了口气，四处看着，却避开了利古尔的目光。

"I don't know what you mean," he said with a bit too much determination.  
他带着过于坚决的口气说道：“我不知道你在说什么。”

Ligur scowled briefly. 利古尔皱了皱眉。

For a moment they were silent.  
一时间他们保持沉默。

"But I mean," said Crowley then. Ligur groaned. "It was quite odd seeing the two of you like that."  
“可是我是说，”克劳利接着说道。利古尔叹了口气。“看到你们两个那样子，真是相当奇怪。”

"So what?" 那又怎样？

"Like, I don't know what exactly it was between you, and it's none of my business..."  
就像，我不知道你们之间到底发生了什么，这不关我的事...

"Exactly," Ligur hissed sharply, glaring. "And I'm not goin' to talk 'bout this with _you_ of all people."  
"没错，"利古尔怒气冲冲地嘶声道，怒视着对方。"而且我才不会跟你这种人谈论这个问题。"

A guilty expression crossed Crowley's face, put down its towel on the nicest spot, and went elsewhere.  
克劳利的脸上闪过一丝内疚的表情，将毛巾放在最好的位置，然后离开了。

"Look, I..." he began, but Ligur just glared.  
"看，我..." 他开始说，但利格尔只是怒视着他。

"Shut it. It's over. I didn't use me chance t'say anything, and Hastur never took it. You can't be that dull to not get..."  
闭嘴。结束了。我没机会说什么，Hastur也没接受。你不至于那么迟钝，不明白吗...

"I think he can be," someone interrupted.  
"我觉得他有可能成为," 有人打断了。

Michael. 迈克尔。

Crowley already didn't hold the Archangel in any high regard, but the look she was giving Ligur had him move her a good number of places down on his inner list of tolerable people.  
克劳利对大天使本来就没有什么高看的，但她对利古尔的眼神让他把她在他内心可容忍人物名单上的位置往后调了好几个。

It was a mix of smugness, and confusion. Crowley chalked the latter down as being caused by the coat.  
这是一种自鸣得意和困惑的混合感觉。克劳利将后者归因于那件外套。

"I... see you got your coat back," said Michael. Ligur sneered briefly, while Crowley rolled his eyes.  
"我...看到你找回了你的外套，"迈克尔说道。利古尔嗤笑了一下，而克劳利则翻了个白眼。

"Mr Slick here," Ligur jabbed a thumb at Crowley, "kept it as a trophy."  
“这位滑头先生，”利古尔用拇指指了指克劳利，“把它当作了一个纪念品。”

Crowley bristled. 克劳利怒气冲冲。

"I did not." 我没有。

"Vile," Michael commented. "Typically demonic."  
"恶劣的，"迈克尔评论道。"典型的邪恶。"

If she had hoped to gain any points with Ligur for that comment, it definitely backfired. At least Ligur said nothing. The general temperature seemed to drop a little when he spoke then, though.  
如果她希望通过那个评论赢得Ligur的好感，那肯定事与愿违了。至少Ligur没有说什么。然而，当他说话时，整个气氛似乎有点冷了下来。

"Why did you call me, Michael?"  
"迈克尔，你为什么给我打电话？"

Michael wrinkled her nose.  
迈克尔皱了皱鼻子。

Credit where it's due, thought Crowley. She took the hint.  
给予应有的赞赏，克劳利想到。她领会了暗示。

"Urgent business," Michael said, then side-eyed Crowley. "Heaven Business."  
"紧急的事情，"迈克尔说着，然后斜眼看了克劳利一眼。“天堂的事情。”

Ligur simply buried his hands in his pockets.  
利古尔简单地把双手插进了口袋里。

"Y'wanted me t'play nanny for'im, you have to live with'im bein' around."  
如果你想让我替他当保姆，那你就得接受他一直在身边。

Michael rolled her eyes. 迈克尔翻了个白眼。

"You didn't enjoy this the slightest before..." She shook her head. "This is too important to involve a demon in it. Seems it was a mistake trying to talk to you directly. I'll be in touch."  
“你以前一点都不喜欢这个…” 她摇了摇头。“这个事情太重要了，不能牵涉到恶魔。看来直接和你交谈是个错误。我会与你保持联系。”

She turned to leave, maybe a little slower than necessary.  
她转身离开，或许比必要的慢了一点点。

But if she had hoped Ligur would call out to her, and tell Crowley to leave... She was wrong.  
但是如果她希望利古尔会呼喊她的名字，告诉克劳利离开...她错了。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

~⧖~

'Scouting' wasn't exactly what Hastur was doing. Rather he was going through all negative emotions in the dictionary, it'd feel like.\*  
“侦察”并不完全是哈斯图尔正在做的事情。相反，他正在翻遍字典中的所有负面情绪，感觉就像……

\* He was kinda stuck on _fussily_ and wondered vaguely why they'd also named some noodles that.  
他有点纠结地想，为什么他们也给一些面条起了那个名字。

Stalking through the afternoon crowds, ducking into alleyways and in general doing a lot of things but paying attention to anything around him. He could do with some drinking.  
穿梭于下午的人群中，躲进小巷，总之做了很多事情，但对周围的一切都不关心。他需要喝点东西。

'Twas what humans do when they felt like this wasn't it?  
这不就是人类在感到这样时所做的吗？

Excessive drinking, excessive smoking, excessive... lotsa things.  
过度饮酒，过度吸烟，过度...很多事情。

Things that made for quick and easy temptations.  
迅速而简便的诱惑之物。

But Hastur loathed exactly this bit about it. Loathed how it reminded him how often he had asked about exactly that back in Heaven.  
但哈斯特尔恰恰讨厌这一点。讨厌它让他想起在天堂时他多么频繁地询问过这个问题。

He had been amongst the angels observing some effects in plants and animals that officially weren't planned.  
他曾经在天使中间观察到一些在植物和动物身上的效应，这些效应在官方上并没有计划。

And he had asked about it. Voiced his concern.  
而他也询问了。表达了他的担忧。

Only to be told that he mustn't doubt the Great Plan and that all would be fine anyway.  
只是被告知他不能怀疑伟大的计划，而且一切都会好的。

And now look at those buggers.  
现在看看那些家伙。

Pouring a likewise excessive amount of energy into finding ways to get better effect, and making more money out of it.  
将同样过多的精力投入到寻找更有效的方法，并从中赚更多的钱。

And what had Heaven done to protect their precious humans?  
天堂为了保护他们珍贵的人类做了什么呢？

Nothing, as usual. 像往常一样，什么都没有。

In any case, he could really do with getting completely plastered. But work was work and if he was honest for a moment, it _was_ a welcome distraction. He cast a baleful look up at the sky, teeth bared in anger, before burying his hands in his pockets and marching on.  
无论如何，他真的需要彻底喝醉。但工作就是工作，如果他诚实地说，这是一个受欢迎的分心。他怒视着天空，咬紧牙关，然后把双手插进口袋，继续前行。

At least the target didn't live too far away from Aziraphale's shop. The house turned out to be the kind Hastur thought of as brick-and-mortar bookmarks. So narrow that having two windows per floor made its facade look rather comical.  
至少目标离亚齐拉费尔的店不算太远。这座房子被哈斯特认为是砖砌的书签类型。如此狭窄，每层楼有两扇窗户，使其外观看起来相当滑稽。

It was a building easy to miss, whether you were looking for it or not.  
这是一座很容易错过的建筑，无论你是有意寻找它还是无意间经过。

Hastur leaned against the wall on the opposite side of the street, and tried to sense anything.  
哈斯特靠在街对面的墙上，努力感知任何东西。

Didn't feel like anyone was at home right now.  
现在感觉家里没人。

Just his luck, wasn't it?  
真是他的运气，不是吗？

Hastur frowned and let his attention shift from one passerby to the next, part out of boredom, part to get some tempting done, part in an attempt to get some information on the target.  
哈斯特皱了皱眉头，将注意力从一个路人转移到另一个路人，一部分是因为无聊，一部分是为了引起一些诱惑，一部分是为了试图获取一些关于目标的信息。

"If you weren't Untouchable I would smite you down here and now," someone said.  
有人说：“如果你不是不可侵犯的，我会立刻将你击倒。”

Hastur cast a disgruntled glance over his shoulder.  
哈斯特尔不满地扭头瞥了一眼。

"Uriel. What did _you_ cock up that yer on Earth?"  
乌里尔，你在地球上搞砸了什么事情？

The Archangel stepped next to him with a huff.  
大天使气喘吁吁地走到他身边。

"It's none of your business, demon," said Uriel, gaze focused on the house. "You're out to drag a soul to Hell."  
"这不关你的事，恶魔，"乌列尔说道，目光专注地盯着那座房子。“你是来把一个灵魂拖入地狱的。”

"What's it to you? The guy's to pay his dues." Hastur lolled his head. "C'mon. You didn't draw my attention jus' to state the obvious. What is it?"  
你管他呢？这家伙该付出代价。哈斯特无精打采地晃动着头。“来吧，你不是为了说个显而易见的事情而吸引我的注意力。到底是什么事？”

Uriel cast him a dark, calculating glare.  
乌里尔投给他一个阴暗而冷酷的目光。

"Have you been with Aziraphale the entire time?"  
你一直和阿齐拉费尔在一起吗？

"Sure, stuck on his arse like a handprint."  
当然，就像手印一样粘在他的屁股上。

Uriel gave him a long look, cold enough to freeze Hell over.  
乌里尔给了他一个长长的眼神，冷得足以让地狱冻结。

"Of course I haven't," Hastur scowled. "He's been to the park wi' Crowley earlier. Take a guess if Crowley lost any word 'bout where he's going."  
“当然没有，”哈斯特皱着眉头说道。“他之前和克劳利去了公园。猜猜看克劳利有没有透露他去哪儿了。”

"Crowley is utterly irrelevant."  
克劳利完全无关紧要。

Hastur whistled. 哈斯特吹了个口哨。

"Lookit that. We gots something we agree on." His small smile quickly faded. "So, what's he done? And don't gimme any 'None of yer business. You approached me about this."  
看这个。我们找到了一件我们都同意的事情。”他的微笑很快消失了。“那么，他做了什么？别给我什么‘不关你的事。是你找上我来的。”

Uriel rolled her shoulders, and laid her hands behind her back.  
乌里尔轻轻地转动了肩膀，将双手放在了背后。

"How much earlier has he been to the park? And can you vouch for that?"  
他提前多久去过公园？你能为此作证吗？

"What harebrained question's that? Told you I've not been with him."  
什么脑袋进水的问题？告诉过你我没和他在一起。

"Where is he now?" 他现在在哪里？

"His shop. As always." 他的店铺。一如既往。

Uriel nodded. 乌里尔点了点头。

"Are you certain?" 你确定吗？

"Unless he snuck out after I left, yes." Hastur was getting a little annoyed. "Gonna tell me now why you're asking?"  
除非他在我离开后偷偷溜走，是的。”哈斯特有点恼火。“现在你要告诉我为什么问这个问题吗？”

Uriel sighed. 乌里尔叹了口气。

"If you must know, I spotted him at the British Museum this morning, and he fled as soon as he saw me."  
如果你非得知道的话，我今天早上在大英博物馆看到了他，他一看见我就逃走了。

"Splendid. He's gone so native he reacts the same way humans do when they see you."  
太棒了。他已经融入得如此彻底，对你的出现反应和人类一样。

With a soft frown that signaled a clearly rising urge to smite, Uriel dragged a hand across her face.  
乌里尔皱起眉头，表明她明显有一种想要打击的冲动，她用手搓了搓脸。

"I thought you didn't do jokes," she said through gritted teeth.  
她咬紧牙关说道：“我以为你不开玩笑的。”

"I don't," said Hastur and pulled a cigarette from his pocket, lighting it. "So, you saw the Principality someplace he can't have been? 'Cause, I trust neither him nor Crowley, but this time, I'd say, he's truthful."  
“我不信。”哈斯特尔说着，从口袋里掏出一支香烟点燃。“所以，你在一个他不可能出现的地方见到了亲王？因为，我对他和克劳利都不信任，但这次，我得说，他是真实的。”

"I saw what I saw, demon."  
我看到了我看到的，恶魔。

"Not sayin' y'didn't." Hastur ignited a finger and lit the cigarette. He took a long, thoughtful drag, and spoke again. "But I tell you what. Someone else saw the Principality on a motorbike. Vintage one. Triumph or Matchless."  
“不是说你没看错。”哈斯特点燃了一根手指，点燃了香烟。他深深地吸了一口，沉思了一会儿，然后继续说道：“但我告诉你吧。还有其他人看到了那个公国骑着一辆摩托车。古董车。可能是特莱姆或者马切斯。”

Uriel snorted unamused. 乌里尔不悦地哼了一声。

"Aziraphale? On a motorcycle? Who's saying that nonsense?"  
阿齐拉费尔？骑摩托车？谁说的这种胡言乱语？

Hastur grinned. 哈斯特露出了一个坏笑。

"Ligur did. And here I thought you'd hold another angel's word in higher regard."  
Ligur做到了。而我还以为你会更重视另一个天使的话语。

~⧖~

**Heaven - Just a little after we first visited Purgatory  
天堂 - 就在我们第一次访问炼狱之后的一点点时间里**

There had always been hidden, quiet corners in Heaven.  
天堂里一直存在着隐秘而宁静的角落。

And after the botched attempt at ending the world there had been a high demand for secluded areas to which one could retreat and reflect.  
在世界末日的失败尝试之后，人们对于可以隐居和反思的僻静地区需求很高。

So Heaven was in the midst of redecorating now, which resulted in some corridors being more liminal then ever.  
所以天堂正在重新装修，这导致一些走廊比以往更加边缘化。

It gave Michael the creeps if she were absolutely honest.  
如果她真诚地说，这让迈克尔感到毛骨悚然。

It was one thing to _know_ God was omnipresently watching, and a whole different one to feel being watched by... some... thing...  
知道上帝无所不在地观察是一回事，而感受到被某种东西观察则完全是另外一回事...

The whole day Michael had felt eyes on her back\* and couldn't shake off the sensation of being followed.  
整天以来，迈克尔一直感觉到有人在背后盯着她，无法摆脱被跟踪的感觉。

\* Other than her own, of course.  
除了她自己的，当然。

And she'd swear she had seen something move just out of sight whenever she looked over her shoulder.  
每当她回头看的时候，她总是发誓自己看到了一些东西在视线之外移动。

It was ridiculous. 太荒谬了。

"I'm very sorry, Michael," said Gabriel, wandering the new corridors alongside her. "But you know better than I that there's no surveillance in the new area."  
"我非常抱歉，迈克尔，"加布里埃尔边走在她身旁的新走廊上边说道。"但你比我更清楚，在这个新区域没有监控。"

"So you do not believe me?" Michael scowled.  
"那你不相信我了吗？" 迈克尔皱起了眉头。

Gabriel raised his hands in defense.  
加布里埃尔举起双手进行防御。

"I do believe you. But I must ask if you are certain that it's not just stress."  
我相信你。但我必须问一下，你确定这不仅仅是压力吗？

"We had this talk, Gabriel, it isn't."  
我们谈过了，加布里埃尔，不是这样的。

"Yes. But if you would like to take a day off to clear your head I am certain the Almighty..."  
是的。但是如果你想休一天做个头脑清醒的决定，我相信全能的...

Michael rolled her eyes, effectively shutting Gabriel up, and they walked in silence for a bit.  
迈克尔翻了个白眼，成功地让加百列闭嘴了，然后他们默默地走了一段时间。

"Michael, I mean it," Gabriel tried anew, genuine concern in his voice. "It won't..."  
"迈克尔，我是认真的，"加百列再次努力说道，声音中流露出真挚的关切。“这不会…”

Michael put a finger to her lips.  
迈克尔把手指放在她的嘴唇上。

"Did you hear that?" she asked.  
"你听到了吗？"她问道。

"Is this the set-up for a snarky remark?" Gabriel frowned, a little forlorn.  
这是要来一句讽刺的开场白吗？加布里埃尔皱了皱眉，有些失落。

Michael shook her head. 迈克尔摇了摇头。

"No... shhh... let's keep walking."  
不...嘘...我们继续走吧。

She nudged Gabriel along, all muscles tense.  
她用力推了一下加布里埃尔，全身肌肉绷紧。

Then there was the sound again.  
然后又传来了声音。

A fine, rhythmic click-clicky-click of... Michael couldn't say what it was, but it ought to be rather small.  
一个美妙而有节奏的咔嗒咔嗒声……迈克尔无法说出它是什么，但应该是相当小的东西。

Gabriel looked a little flabbergasted at Michael.  
加布里埃尔看着迈克尔，有点惊讶。

Good. 好的。

He had heard it too.  
他也听到了。

They slowed their pace slightly.  
他们稍微放慢了步伐。

The clicking followed. 点击声接着响起。

Michael stopped. 迈克尔停下来。

Gabriel stopped. 加布里埃尔停下来。

The clicking didn't. 点击没有。

Not until it was maybe one or two steps behind the Archangels.  
直到它也许只有一两步落后于大天使们。

Michael turned. 迈克尔转身。

Slowly. 慢慢来。

Flexing her hand, ready to fight.  
屈指一弹，准备战斗。

But there was nothing... 但是什么都没有...

In her direct line of sight, at least.  
至少在她的直线视线范围内。

"Oh, odd," Gabriel commented, having spotted the little creature on the floor before them first.  
"哦，奇怪啊，"加布里埃尔评论道，他首先在地板上发现了那个小生物。

Michael crouched down and stared at it, rather bewildered.  
迈克尔蹲下身子，有些困惑地盯着它。

It was a small and very dully colored chameleon, gazing up at Michael almost expectantly.  
那是一只小而颜色非常暗淡的变色龙，凝视着迈克尔，几乎带着期待的神情。

The sight pulled on her heartstrings.  
那景象牵动了她的心弦。

If she wouldn't have known that it was absolutely impossible, she'd have sworn....  
如果她不知道这是绝对不可能的，她会发誓...

"What..." Michael began, choking a little, but the tiny thing turned, skittering down the corridor and vanishing behind a corner.  
“什么……”迈克尔开始说话，有些噎住了，但那个小东西转身，匆匆跑过走廊，消失在拐角后面。

"Very odd," said Gabriel, before looking Michael over. "Are you alright? You look positively haunted."  
"非常奇怪，"加百列说道，然后审视着迈克尔。"你没事吧？你看起来一副鬼魂缠身的样子。"

Michael shook her head. 迈克尔摇了摇头。

"I don't know." 我不知道。

"Michael, I can only guess what you are thinking. But..." Gabriel sighed helplessly.  
迈克尔，我只能猜测你在想什么。但是...加百利无奈地叹了口气。

He wanted to say something soothing and reassuring, but couldn't think of anything. This very specific case was absolutely not his forte.  
他想说一些安抚和安心的话，但是却想不出来。这个非常特殊的情况绝对不是他的强项。

"Just don't remind me he's gone," said Michael, looking sharply at the other Archangel, lips pressed into a thin line. "I remember it all too well."  
“别提醒我他已经离开了。”迈克尔说着，目光锐利地望着另一个大天使，嘴唇紧抿成一条细线。“我记得得太清楚了。”

Gabriel nodded curtly and looked down the hallway again.  
加布里埃尔短暂地点了点头，再次朝走廊望去。

"Oh!" 哦！

His eyes widened in surprise as he spotted the little creature skittering back and forth at the corner.  
他惊讶地睁大了眼睛，看到那个小生物在角落里来回蹦跳。

Michael shared the expression and sentiment.  
迈克尔分享了他的表达和情感。

And it almost immediately shifted to an alarmed stare as another - dreadfully familiar - figure staggered and stumbled after the little chameleon.  
而它几乎立刻转变成了一种惊恐的凝视，因为另一个令人恐惧地熟悉的身影摇摇晃晃地跟在小变色龙后面。

Michael spun to face Gabriel, eyes wide.  
迈克尔转身面对加百列，眼睛瞪大。

Gabriel had paled the same as she had before.  
加布里埃尔的脸色变得苍白，就像她之前一样。

Then Michael turned back, sprinting forward.  
然后迈克尔转身，向前冲去。

"Gabriel! Get Raphael! _Now_!"  
"加布里埃尔！快去找拉斐尔！现在！"

~⧖~

**London - Now 伦敦 - 现在**

It was a bit weird how different England seemed to smell after not having been there for roughly two years.  
大约两年没去过英格兰，回去后发现它的气味有些奇怪。

In part Warlock was happy to be back. He liked England.  
在某种程度上，战锤很高兴回来了。他喜欢英格兰。

But another part of him was outright pissed at the circumstances that had him return.  
但他的另一部分对让他回来的情况感到非常生气。

In the next room he heard his mother and her best friend chatter on and on about how 'It was the right thing to do'.  
在隔壁房间里，他听到他妈妈和她最好的朋友不停地聊着“这是正确的做法”。

_'It'_ in this case was the divorce from Warlock's dad.  
在这种情况下，“它”指的是与Warlock的父亲的离婚。

That weird trip to the Middle East had really brought out the worst in his parents, and that they went to America instead of going back to England didn't help.  
那次奇怪的中东之行真的让他的父母表现得最糟糕，而他们选择去美国而不是回英国也没有帮助。

Warlock got up from the windowsill and closed the door, before putting on headphones and slumping down on his bed.  
术士从窗台上站起来，关上门，然后戴上耳机，倒在床上。

Temporary bed. 临时床。

Warlock and his mom were staying at the aforementioned friend's house and the bed belonged to her own son.  
术士和他妈妈住在之前提到的朋友家里，床是她自己儿子的。

Who had moved to Amsterdam or something a month before.  
一个月前搬到了阿姆斯特丹或者其他地方的人。

And Warlock's mother spent most of the day househunting. She still had connections and money, so that would not be an issue, but she had gotten it into her head to 'do things right this time', whatever that meant.  
术士的母亲整天都在找房子。她还保持着人脉和财力，所以这不是问题，但她已经下定决心要“这次做对”，不管那意味着什么。

Warlock felt as if the time since that weird trip was a big waste of, well, time.  
术士觉得自从那次奇怪的旅行以来，时间过得好像是一种巨大的浪费。

At least he had friends in England. Well, people his age he knew, at least.  
至少他在英国有朋友。嗯，至少是他认识的同龄人。

But all in all, life had gotten really dull. And there wasn't much to do about it. It wasn't as if there was an adventure waiting around the corner or something...  
但总的来说，生活变得非常乏味。而且对此也没有太多办法。好像也没有什么冒险等着在拐角处...

~⧖~

**Heaven - About a day after the last visit  
天堂 - 上次访问后的大约一天**

As Ligur woke he felt worse than ever before. And he had a very good idea of 'feeling bad', not just when it came to doing that to others.  
当利古尔醒来时，他感觉比以往任何时候都糟糕。而且他对“感觉不好”有着非常清楚的概念，不仅仅是对别人做出这种感觉。

He had fought in Heaven, taken a million lightyear dive onto solid obsidian, and had his wings ripped off in the process, leaving nothing but stumps. He had been there for the invention of alcohol, and subsequently the invention of hangovers, had been executed and exorcised a couple of times, shot, drowned, crushed and electrocuted.  
他曾在天堂中战斗过，在一百万光年的距离上坠落到坚硬的黑曜石上，并在此过程中被撕裂了翅膀，只剩下了残根。他亲眼见证了酒的发明，以及随之而来的宿醉的发明，曾被处决和驱魔多次，被枪击、淹死、压碎和电击。

And, of course, been doused in Holy Water.  
当然，还要用圣水洒上。

And that was the weird part.  
那就是奇怪的地方。

Why and how the _fuck_ was he alive?  
他为什么还活着？他是怎么活下来的？

He had to be alive to feel this bad.  
他必须活着才能感受到这么糟糕。

But it made no sense. At least the feeling was improving the more he woke up.  
但这毫无意义。至少随着他醒来，感觉正在改善。

He groaned, and blinked his eyes a few times to get the world into focus.  
他呻吟了一声，眨了几下眼睛，让世界变得清晰起来。

And twitched as he saw the little chameleon resting on his chest.  
当他看到小变色龙躺在他的胸口上时，他不禁抽搐了一下。

He absent-mindedly ran a hand over his head.  
他心不在焉地用手抚摸了一下自己的头。

"Oh, yeah. That's a thing wot happened..." he murmured, vaguely remembering waking up before, feeling even worse and finding that 'his' chameleon somehow was its own entity...  
"哦，是啊。那是发生的一件事..."他喃喃自语，模糊地记得之前醒来时感觉更糟糕，发现‘他’的变色龙竟然成了自己独立的存在...

Slowly he sat up, the little creature squeaking in protest as the movement woke it up and nearly had it tumble off the bed.  
慢慢地，他坐了起来，小动物发出尖叫声抗议，因为他的动作把它吵醒了，差点让它从床上摔下来。

"Sorry," whispered Ligur, before taking stock of his situation:  
"抱歉，"利格尔低声说道，然后开始评估自己的处境：

He was in a soft bed in a small room somewhere, devoid of any decoration, except for a plain bedside table and a chair. There was a dim light that cycled through various colors.  
他躺在某个地方的一张软床上，房间很小，除了一个简单的床头柜和一把椅子外，没有任何装饰。有一盏昏暗的灯，不断变换着各种颜色。

He was clean, patched up in some places and - he quickly peeked under the cover - naked. He couldn't decide if he was more surprised by that or by his old robe hung over the chair, just as torn and charred as he remembered it.  
他整洁干净，有些地方修补过，他迅速地掀开被子，发现自己一丝不挂。他无法确定自己对此感到更惊讶，还是对悬挂在椅子上的旧袍子感到更惊讶，正如他记得的那样破烂和烧焦。

But there wasn't a single clue as to where he was... or why he was there. Why he was at all. He rubbed his face - not feeling any scars or anything missing, which was more unsettling than a reason to be happy - and tried to get his thoughts in order.  
但是没有任何线索表明他在哪里……或者为什么他在那里。为什么他存在于这个世界。他摸了摸脸——没有感觉到任何疤痕或者缺失的东西，这比有个理由感到高兴更让人不安——然后试图整理自己的思绪。

He remembered Crowley's flat, the pain...  
他记得克劳利的公寓，那种痛苦...

And waking in some shade-covered garden with the chameleon. And something just before that that he couldn't remember no matter how hard he tried. And then things were extremely blurry... before he woke up here.  
在一个被树荫覆盖的花园里醒来，身边有只变色龙。在那之前有些事情，无论他多么努力，都无法回忆起来。然后一切变得模糊不清...直到他在这里醒来。

Was this the thereafter for demons?  
这是恶魔的未来吗？

Well, it'd fit with God's sense of humor. Ligur couldn't say he ever like that.  
嗯，这符合上帝的幽默感。Ligur不能说他喜欢那个。

He wriggled into a more comfortable position and looked at the little creature in his lap.  
他扭动身体，找到一个更舒适的姿势，然后看着他膝上的小动物。

"I'd ask ya what's goin' on, but I think you have as much an idea as I..." He frowned. "What are you even?"  
我本想问你发生了什么事，但我觉得你和我一样一无所知……"他皱了皱眉头。“你到底是什么东西？”

He gently picked the little thing up and held it at eye-level.  
他轻轻地把小东西拿起来，将它举到眼睛的高度。

It was 'his' chameleon, alright. His... he couldn't think of a suitable term. The chameleon had been him as much as any other part of his body. And now it wasn't.  
没错，那是“他”的变色龙。他……他想不出一个合适的词来形容。这只变色龙曾经和他一样重要，就像他身体的一部分。而现在它不再是了。

Then again, Ligur felt an odd connection to it, the same kind as before.  
然而，利古尔再次感到了一种奇怪的联系，与之前的那种感觉相同。

But different. 但是不同。

He groaned. 他呻吟了一声。

He was really not in any state for existential questions other than 'Why was he here, wherever _here_ was?'.  
他真的没有心情去思考存在的问题，除了“他为什么会在这里，无论这里是哪里？”

The little creature tilted its head... and smacked Ligur in the face with its tongue.  
小生物歪着头...然后用舌头狠狠地打在利格尔的脸上。

"Bloody choirs!" Ligur muttered, more surprised than angry. He looked at the chameleon blankly.  
"该死的合唱团！"利古尔嘟囔着，既惊讶又生气。他茫然地看着变色龙。

"Oh great. You're me conscience then or somethin'."  
哦，太好了。你是我的良心还是什么的。

With another groan he laid back onto the pillow, gazing at the featureless ceiling, while the chameleon skittered around on his chest, before hopping off onto the floor.  
他又一声叹息，躺回枕头上，凝视着毫无特色的天花板，而变色龙在他的胸口上蹦来蹦去，然后跳到地板上。

Ligur watched it for a moment, before his mind began circling round the same questions again.  
利古尔注视了一会儿，然后他的思绪又开始围绕着同样的问题打转。

Where was he? Why and how was he here? And Where was here?  
他在哪里？为什么和怎么他会在这里？这里是哪里？

He turned his head again, realization hitting him like a cold sho- like a branch to the face:  
他再次转过头，顿时意识到了，就像一阵冷风吹来，就像一根树枝狠狠地打在脸上：

There was no door. 没有门。

No windows either. 也没有窗户。

Wherever he was, he was trapped.  
无论他身在何处，他都被困住了。

Now, some people might have panicked upon such insight. Or despaired.  
现在，有些人可能对这样的洞察力感到恐慌。或者绝望。

Ligur got angry. 利古尔生气了。

Whoever trapped him here better had used really thick and fireproofed walls if they wanted to keep him. He sat back up, bared his teeth, flexed his fingers and...  
谁曾经把他困在这里的人最好用了非常厚实和防火的墙壁，如果他们想要把他留住的话。他重新坐起来，露出牙齿，伸展手指然后...

Nothing happened. 什么都没发生。

Ligur blinked. The chameleon looked at him from atop the chair.  
利古尔眨了眨眼睛。变色龙从椅子上看着他。

Ligur tried summoning Hellfire again.  
利古尔再次尝试召唤地狱之火。

Nothing. 什么都没有。

His brows furrowed. This was... weird.  
他的眉头紧锁。这...有点奇怪。

Granted, he had died -probably- but he could clearly feel energy pulsing inside him.  
虽然他已经去世了 -或许- 但他明显能感受到体内的能量在脉动。

He tried again. 他再次尝试。

And again nothing came of it.  
又一次没有结果。

This shouldn't be happening. There was nothing to bar him from using his powers.  
这不应该发生。没有任何事情阻止他使用他的能力。

He turned slightly and gestured at the pillow.  
他微微转身，指了指枕头。

It flopped over. 它翻倒了。

That had worked. 那个起作用了。

The chameleon looked at him accusingly.  
变色龙生气地盯着他。

"Oh, come now," said Ligur, looking back with the same sentiment. "Not gonna 'splode the bloody thing. It's one of the nicest not-living things I laid on since Falling, an' you know that."  
“噢，别这样嘛。”利格尔说着，带着同样的情绪回头看着。“不会让这该死的东西爆炸的。自从堕落以来，这是我见过的最好的非生物之一，你也知道。”

The chameleon tilted its head the other way.  
变色龙把头歪向另一边。

Ligur, meanwhile, let out a heavy and sorrowful sigh as another question surfaced like a bloated corpse.  
与此同时，利古尔沉重地叹了口气，又有一个问题浮出水面，就像一具浮肿的尸体。

_Was Hastur alright? 哈斯特还好吗？_

He wasn't here. Had he gotten Crowley?  
他不在这里。他找到克劳利了吗？

Was he on the battlefield right now?  
他现在在战场上吗？

Ligur winced. Something inside him had just answered that question with a distinct _No_, and he didn't know why.  
利古尔皱了皱眉头。他内心深处刚刚对这个问题做出了明确的否定回答，但他不知道为什么。

Ligur held his head, trying to figure why he felt so certain about that. He didn't notice a part of a wall sliding open with nothing but a small _Whuush_.  
利古尔捂着头，试图弄清楚为什么他对此如此确定。他没有注意到一段墙壁悄悄滑开，只发出了一声轻微的嗖声。

"Oh! You are awake." 哦！你醒了。

Ligur looked up. 利古尔抬起头。

"Michael?" He blinked, astonished. "What...?"  
"迈克尔？" 他眨了眨眼，惊讶地说道。"什么……？"

The Archangel held up a hand, signaling him to wait, before pulling out her phone and murmuring something to whomever she had called.  
大天使举起一只手，示意他等一下，然后拿出手机，对她打电话的人低声说了些什么。

Ligur couldn't make out a word. Then Michael put the phone away and stepped over, her face stern.  
利古尔听不懂一句话。然后迈克尔把手机放下，走过来，脸色严肃。

"How are you?" she asked, sitting down on the edge of the bed.  
她坐在床边，问道：“你好吗？”

"Confused, bit nauseous an' oddly enough not dead." Ligur sighed heavily. "Where is here?"  
迷惑不解，有点恶心，奇怪的是还没死。利格尔沉重地叹了口气。“这是哪里？”

"Heaven," Michael stated curtly.  
"天堂，"迈克尔干脆地说道。

Ligur leaned away. 利古尔向后倾斜了一下。

"Yer kiddin'." "你开玩笑吧。"

"Not remotely." 一点也不。

"What am I doin' here then?"  
那我在这里干嘛呢？

Michael simply shrugged. 迈克尔只是耸了耸肩。

"I had hoped you could tell me. We found you yesterday, stumbling through the corridors."  
我本以为你能告诉我。昨天我们找到了你，在走廊里踉跄而行。

"Of Heaven?" Ligur quirked a brow, casually catching the chameleon as it tried to hop back onto the bed.  
"天堂？" 利古尔挑了挑眉毛，随意地抓住变色龙，它试图跳回床上。

"It's very odd indeed. Your... well, friend there," Michael nodded at the little creature, "led us to you. Raphael patched you back up. You looked horrible... but after what happened... Raphael did a good job." Michael looked away.  
"真的很奇怪。你...嗯，那个朋友在那边，"迈克尔朝着那个小生物点了点头，"带我们找到了你。拉斐尔给你包扎好了伤口。你看起来很糟糕...但是经历了那些事情之后...拉斐尔做得很好。"迈克尔把目光移开了。

"I... guess." Ligur fell silent, trying not to remember the events. And failed. He barely managed to bite back a whimper as he traced a hand over the patches and bandages on his face and over his eye.  
“我...猜吧。”利古尔沉默了下来，努力不去回忆那些事件。但他失败了。他勉强忍住了一声呜咽，用手轻抚着脸上的绷带和眼睛上的眼罩。

"You will probably be right as rain again in no time," said Michael. "I told you, Raphael did a good job."  
"你很快就会恢复如初的，没错的，"迈克尔说道。"我告诉过你，拉斐尔做得很好。"

"Raphael's a ... windfall." Enough smalltalk, Ligur _had_ to get answers now.  
拉斐尔是个...意外之财。别再闲聊了，利古尔现在必须得到答案。

About Armageddon, about Crowley... about Hastur...  
关于末日，关于克劳利...关于哈斯特尔...

"Michael, if I'm here... who won the war?"  
迈克尔，如果我在这里...谁赢得了战争？

Michael took a deep breath and stared off into the distance.  
迈克尔深吸一口气，凝视着远方。

"No one," she finally said. "There... was no war."  
"没有人，"她最终说道。"那里...没有战争。"

"What?" 什么？

"Crowley and... Aziraphale... they..." Michael sighed, and told Ligur, to her best knowledge, about what happened after his death.🔄  ❓

Ligur sat up ever so slightly.  
利古尔微微坐直了身子。

"Crowley... stopped Armageddon? And that trial got... nowhere?"  
克劳利...阻止了世界末日？而那场审判...一无所获？

Any question he had about Hastur died on his tongue. He knew.  
他心中对哈斯图尔的任何疑问都戛然而止。他明白了。

"Oh." 哦。

Ligur hung his head before slowly laying back down, curling in on himself.  
利古尔低下头，慢慢地躺下来，将自己卷成一团。

"I... need t'go back," he finally said. Only to have Michael's face soften with... was it pity? It was a very weird look.  
"我...需要回去，"他终于说道。只见迈克尔的脸上露出了柔和的表情...是怜悯吗？这是一种非常奇怪的表情。

"To Hell?" Michael asked. Ligur just nodded. He wasn't in any state of mind to snark at that.  
"去地狱？" 迈克尔问道。利古尔只是点了点头。他此刻并没有心情去嘲讽。

"You can't," said Michael, reaching out as if to take his hand, but pulling back the last moment.  
“你不可以。”迈克尔说着，伸出手仿佛要握住他的手，但在最后一刻又收了回来。

"Why not?" Ligur raised a brow in annoyance.  
为什么不呢？利古尔不满地挑起了眉毛。

"Well..." Michael began. "I don't know how to put this but..."  
“嗯……”迈克尔开始说道。“我不知道该怎么说，但是……”

"Michael. I'm a demon. I fought, I Fell, remember?"  
迈克尔，我是个恶魔。我战斗过，我堕落了，还记得吗？

Michael just shook her head. The chameleon mimicked her.  
迈克尔只是摇了摇头。变色龙模仿了她。

"It's," Michael began. "Ligur, try summoning hellfire."  
"开始吧，"迈克尔说道。"利古尔，试着召唤地狱之火。"

Ligur blinked. 利古尔眨了眨眼睛。

"Y'know, I knows y'been all for the war, but that it didn't happen's not a reason to..."  
你知道，我知道你一直支持这场战争，但它没有发生并不是一个理由去...

"Ligur." Michael said, all serious. "You know that's not what I meant." Her voice softened. "But thank you for your concerns."  
“Ligur。”迈克尔认真地说道。“你知道我不是这个意思。”她的声音变得柔和起来。“但还是谢谢你的关心。”

"You'll laugh. I already tried. Didn't work." Ligur gave her a sad smile. "Guess that comes with..." A sudden stray thought struck him and his eyes widened, all color draining from them (and the chameleon) to a disbelieving and denying gray.  
你会笑的。我已经试过了。没用。"利古尔给了她一个悲伤的微笑。"猜猜那是因为..." 一种突如其来的杂念击中了他，他的眼睛瞪大了，所有的颜色（包括变色龙）都从他们身上消失，变成了一种不可置信和否认的灰色。

Hastily he lifted his hand, flexing it a little.  
匆忙地，他举起手，稍微伸展了一下。

It wasn't Hellfire he had called forth.  
他召唤出的并不是地狱之火。

"Huh," he said, voice dry and sober. "Guess that bloody Holy Water's some damn potent stuff..."  
“哼。”他说道，声音干燥而冷静。“看来那该死的圣水真是个厉害的东西…”

**Tadfield - Now 塔德菲尔德 - 现在**

"Whaddaya think?" Adam was brooding over his homework, while Dog was chewing on something vaguely bone-shaped that once upon a time might have made a squeaking sound.  
“你觉得怎么样？”亚当正在为他的作业烦恼，而狗则在咀嚼着一个模糊地形似骨头的东西，曾经可能发出吱吱声。

Dog looked up expectantly upon Adam addressing him like that.  
当亚当这样称呼它时，狗满怀期待地抬起头来。

"About what Mr Aziraphale said," said Adam, doodling around. "Like, he knows Mr Crowley ever since and when he gets that worried..."  
关于阿齐拉费尔先生说的事情，"亚当边涂鸦边说道，"就像，他和克劳利先生认识很久了，当他变得那么担心的时候..."

Dog barked curtly. 狗生硬地吠叫了一声。

"Yeah," said Adam, putting the pen down and leaning back. "D'you think this' got anything to do with this odd... something in the air?"  
“是啊，”亚当放下笔，向后靠着说道。“你觉得这跟空气中的奇怪东西有关系吗？”

Dog just tilted his head.  
狗刚刚歪了一下头。

"It has to, hasn't it?" mused Adam, and moved onto his bed, Dog jumping to cuddle next to him. "We should call Miss Anathema an' tell her about her Great-great-great-great-great-granny's book."  
"这是必须的，不是吗？" 亚当沉思着，走到床上，狗跳上来靠在他旁边。"我们应该给安娜塞玛小姐打个电话，告诉她她曾曾曾曾曾祖母的书的事情。"

Dog look up a little alarmed.  
狗抬头有点惊慌。

"I know," said Adam. One of the prophecies in Miss Mag's book has stated that he mustn't contact Miss Anathema. But Adam would be... something... if he'd withhold such information from her.  
“我知道。”亚当说道。《玛格小姐的书》中的一个预言说他不能联系安娜塔玛小姐。但是如果他对她隐瞒这样的信息，那亚当就太过分了。

~⧖~

**Heaven - Picking up shortly after when we left off  
天堂 - 继续我们离开的地方不久之后**

An angel. 一个天使。

That was definitely the last thing Ligur had a expected.  
那绝对是Ligur最意想不到的事情了。

Demons don't ascend. Granted, demons don't come back from a Holy Water shower either, yet here he was.  
恶魔不会升天。虽然恶魔也不会从圣水淋浴中复活，但他却在这里。

It was all far too much.  
这一切都太多了。

Michael had left shortly after that revelation, and Ligur had laid back down to rest, falling into an uneasy slumber.  
迈克尔在那个揭示之后不久离开了，利古尔则躺下休息，陷入了不安的熟睡中。

But now... 但是现在...

Ligur stirred, swatting his hand at whatever was poking at his nose, and screwed the good eye open.  
利古尔醒来，用手拍打着鼻子上的东西，然后睁开了那只好眼睛。

It took a moment of bewilderedness till he remembered what had happened and especially that he and the chameleon were sort of separate entities now.  
直到他想起发生了什么事情，尤其是他和变色龙现在有点像是分开的实体，这让他感到困惑了一会儿。

"You seem pretty set on not lettin' me rest," he murmured, watching the little creature run in circles on the bed. By all means, it was excited, but not in a good way. Or maybe it was. It was an odd feeling.  
“你似乎很坚决不让我休息，”他低声说着，看着小动物在床上打转。无论如何，它很兴奋，但并不是一种好的方式。或许也是好的方式。这是一种奇怪的感觉。

Then Ligur sensed it too.  
然后利古尔也感觉到了。

An odd feeling of friendship and...  
一种奇怪的友谊和...

The door slid open before he could think about it further.  
在他进一步思考之前，门滑开了。

"Ligur! Goodness gracious, sweetie, I only _now_ got the news!"  
哎呀！天哪，亲爱的，我现在才听到这个消息！

Before Ligur could say anything, Raziel was over at the bed, holding him in a bearhug.  
在Ligur还没来得及说什么之前，Raziel已经冲到床边，紧紧地拥抱住他。

Ligur coughed curtly. 利古尔干咳了一声。

"Ra... Raziel," he managed, trying to sort his feelings, ultimately opting on relief.  
"拉...拉齐尔，"他努力控制自己的情绪，最终选择了松了一口气。

He considered Michael a friend, all things considered (though he had the feeling Michael might see him... differently) but Raziel had been the sole person he'd ever consider his, what was that fancy human term again, BFF\*.  
考虑到一切（尽管他有一种感觉迈克尔可能会以不同的方式看待他），他认为迈克尔是个朋友，但拉齐尔是他唯一会考虑称之为他的，那个花哨的人类术语是什么来着，BFF\*。

\*Hastur was something else entirely that humans don't have a term for, no matter how much they claim they do.  
哈斯特是完全不同的存在，人类无论如何声称都无法用一个词来形容。

"You got the news _after_ everyone else?" Ligur quipped, a part of him not wanting to let go of his oldest friend and mentor.  
你比其他人都晚得到这个消息？利古尔调侃道，他内心的一部分不愿意放弃他最老的朋友和导师。

"Oh, boo," said Raziel. "So far only Michael, Raphael and Gabriel know. And of course the Boss. And I was busy elsewhere. But, oh sweetheart, I came here as soon as I heard the good tidings."  
"哦，呸，" Raziel 说道。"到目前为止，只有迈克尔、拉斐尔和加百列知道。当然，还有老板。而我则忙于其他地方。但是，哦，亲爱的，一听到这个好消息，我立刻就来了这里。"

"Good tidings, yeah." Ligur murmured, looking away.  
好消息，是的。”利古尔低声说着，扭过头去。

"Now lookie here, dearie," Raziel said softly, cupping Ligur's chin. "I hate seeing you this sad. What's wrong? This isn't about you having ascended."  
“听着，亲爱的，”Raziel轻声说道，捧起Ligur的下巴。“看到你这么伤心，我真的很难过。怎么了？这与你的升天无关。”

Ligur sighed. 利古尔叹了口气。

"It's part that. I'm not cut out t' be an angel. Never been but..." He looked at Raziel for a little longer than necessary. And swallowed dryly. "But..."  
"就是这样。我不适合成为天使。从来就不是，但是..." 他盯着拉齐尔看了比必要的时间更久。然后干巴巴地咽了口口水。"但是..."

"Yes?" "是吗？"

"...nothing... ow!" Ligur pulled his hand back as the chameleon had bit it. "Bloody traitor!"  
“什么都没有……哎！”利古尔把手缩了回来，因为变色龙咬了他一口。“该死的叛徒！”

"I don't think it's happy with you not speaking your mind." Raziel chuckled, propping elbows on the bed and looking at Ligur with mischievous expectancy. "So?"  
“我觉得它不会喜欢你不坦率地表达自己。”Raziel笑着，撑着手肘坐在床上，期待地看着Ligur，眼神中透着调皮。“那么呢？”

Ligur frowned, nursing his hand and shaking his head.  
利古尔皱了皱眉头，捂着手摇了摇头。

"It won't do... it's too late..."  
不行了...太晚了...

Raziel sat up, nodding thoughtfully.  
拉齐尔坐起身来，若有所思地点了点头。

"Is this about Hasiel... Hastur I mean, I'm sorry."  
这是关于哈希尔...不对，是哈斯图尔的事情吗？抱歉。

Ligur looked up, and slowly away again. And nodded.  
利古尔抬起头，慢慢地又低下去，然后点了点头。

"Hell will have turned its attention to him... months ago..." he managed, catching himself shaking, and tried to breathe steadily. "Michael said she hasn't heard any rumors 'bout him..."  
“地狱早就盯上他了……几个月前……”他勉强说出来，感觉自己在颤抖，努力保持平静的呼吸。“迈克尔说她没听说过关于他的任何传闻……”

Raziel scoffed gently, rubbing Ligur's neck.  
拉齐尔轻蔑地嗤笑着，轻轻地揉着利古尔的脖子。

"Rumors are my forte, aren't they, darling?" Raziel smiled, watching the chameleon nudge Ligur's hand as if to apologize.  
谣言是我的专长，是吗，亲爱的？拉齐尔微笑着，看着变色龙轻轻碰了一下利古尔的手，仿佛在道歉。

"Yes, but there's... can't... can't have rumors if..." Ligur took a deep shuddering breath.  
"是的，但是有...不能...如果...不能有谣言的话..." 利古尔深吸了一口气。

"There's always rumors and gossip, Ligur." Raziel gave his shoulder a soft squeeze. "I might have one for you."  
"总是有谣言和八卦，利古尔。"拉齐埃尔轻轻地拍了拍他的肩膀。“我可能有一个给你。”

"Huh?" Ligur looked up. “嗯？”利古尔抬起头。

"It's, obviously, just rumors, but it'd seem there's been quite some ruckus just yesterday. No idea what happened, but for all I know something escaped from Hell and into Purgatory."  
显然，这只是谣言，但昨天似乎发生了一些骚动。我不知道发生了什么，但据我所知，有什么东西从地狱逃到了炼狱。

"Purgatory?" "炼狱？"

Ligur's eyes widened, softly shifting color to something that clearly spoke of hope blossoming.  
利古尔的眼睛瞪大了，柔和地变换着颜色，明显流露出希望正在绽放的意味。

"Oh," Raziel said, amused. "Now that's a nifty trick, dearie. Heard about it. It's just spectacular in person."  
“哦，”Raziel笑着说道，“这可真是个巧妙的把戏，亲爱的。听说过它，亲眼目睹果然壮观。”

### Chapter Text 章节正文

~⧖~

It was Friday now.  
现在是星期五。

Aziraphale was pouring over a report Hastur had written up, while the demon in question was putting books onto the shelves.  
阿齐拉费尔正在仔细研究哈斯特尔撰写的报告，而涉及的恶魔则正在将书籍放置在书架上。

"Now, 'm not much of'n office gossip," said Hastur, "but that was really the plot of the Pina Colada song."  
“现在，我可不是一个喜欢办公室八卦的人，”哈斯特说，“但那真的就是《Pina Colada》这首歌的情节。”

"For all I know of it, yes," said Aziraphale, tapping his pen onto the paper. He had to give credit where credit's due, the Duke of Hell had possibly the most indecipherable handwriting in all of creation.  
“就我所知，是的。”亚齐拉费尔说着，用笔敲击着纸张。他不得不承认，地狱公爵的字迹可能是整个创世界中最难辨认的。

"You are rather talkative today," Aziraphale observed. Hastur harrumphed.  
"你今天倒是挺健谈的," 阿齐拉费尔观察到。哈斯特嗯了一声。

"We'll be spendin' the rest of near eternity together, might as well talk, right?"  
我们将会一起度过接近永恒的余生，那就聊聊天吧，对吧？

Aziraphale, ultimately admitting defeat at the hands of the demon's handwriting, took off his glasses, pocketed them and shook his head.  
阿齐拉费尔最终承认在恶魔的笔迹面前失败了，他摘下眼镜，放进口袋里，摇了摇头。

"That was not what I meant. Crowley certainly mentioned you are the more talkative between you and Ligur, but you are outright chattering today."  
那不是我想表达的意思。克劳利确实提到过你比利古尔更健谈，但你今天简直是喋喋不休。

Hastur cast him a dark glare.  
哈斯特向他投去一道阴暗的目光。

"Right. Got it. Shuttin' up." He turned back to the shelf.  
"好的，明白了。闭嘴。" 他转身回到书架前。

And Aziraphale sighed. 而阿齐拉费尔叹了口气。

"Look, I'm an angel. I can sense distress even in demons and..."  
看，我是一个天使。我甚至能感受到恶魔中的痛苦和...

"Would of thought with the little snake around you'd grow desensitized or whatever to that."  
有只小蛇绕着你，我本以为你会对这种事情变得麻木或者什么的。

"That was entirely uncalled for."  
那完全没有必要。

It was a bit of a half-hearted defense, on account of Aziraphale having to admit that he, indeed, had begun to tune out Crowley's underlying aura of distress about four centuries ago. Hastur, however, had other concerns.  
这是一个有点敷衍的辩护，因为亚齐拉费尔不得不承认，他确实在大约四个世纪前开始忽视克劳利内心的不安氛围。然而，哈斯特尔却有其他的担忧。

"Uncalled?" he sneered, putting the books down. "Oh so _that_ is uncalled for. But the little runt takin' the piss outta me an' ev'ry other demon's not? Him goin' an'..." Hastur snapped his mouth shut. "Dunno why I'm even tryin'. You bloody angels dun understand this shit anyway."  
“不该？”他嘲笑着放下书。“哦，所以这就是不该的。但是那个小家伙嘲笑我和其他恶魔的时候呢？他去做那个……”哈斯特咬紧了嘴唇。“我也不知道为什么还要试试看。你们这些该死的天使根本不懂这些破事。”

He pushed past Aziraphale, snatched the file from the table and - with a disgusted snarl, a snap and the lingering smell of sulphur and rotten flesh - vanished.  
他推开了阿齐拉费尔，从桌子上抢走了文件，然后带着厌恶的咆哮声、一声啪的声音以及硫磺和腐肉的余味消失了。

Aziraphale knew he should be offended. Instead he opted for worry, as Hastur struck him as seriously holding something in that was just waiting to explode.  
亚齐拉费尔明白他应该感到被冒犯了。然而，他选择了担忧，因为哈斯特尔给他一种严肃地憋着一股即将爆发的东西的感觉。

At least the smell would certainly keep customers away.  
至少这个味道肯定会把顾客赶走。

~⧖~

"I wish I could say I was surprised."  
我希望我能说我感到惊讶。

Sandalphon shook his head in dismay, arms crossed.  
桑达尔芬失望地摇了摇头，双臂交叉。

The gathering in Heaven was small. Gabriel, thus naturally Sandalphon, Raziel and Uriel. All because Uriel had spotted Aziraphale where she should not have been able to spot him twice since her exchange with Hastur.  
天堂的聚会很小。加百列，自然而然地桑达尔芬、拉齐尔和乌列尔。都是因为乌列尔在与哈斯特尔交换后，竟然两次发现了阿齐拉费尔不该发现的地方。

"But I can't," Sandalphon continued. "He's most likely playing his own game again, and there is little chance we can trust the demon."  
“但是我不能。”桑达尔芬继续说道。“他很可能又在玩自己的游戏，我们很难相信那个恶魔。”

Raziel made a face. 拉齐尔皱了皱眉。

"Ligur trusts him. And I trust Ligur."  
Ligur相信他。而我相信Ligur。

"A newly risen angel who has tried about everything to fall again?" sneered Sandalphon in response.  
"一个刚升起的天使，竟然尽力想要再次堕落？"桑达尔芬嗤之以鼻地回答道。

"That is a topic for another time."  
那是另一个时间的话题。

Everyone looked at Gabriel, who was standing with his back to the group, looking intently out of the window.  
大家都看着加布里埃尔，他背对着大家，专注地望着窗外。

"Uriel, you are certain, and I mean absolutely certain, it was Aziraphale? Maybe you mistook a human for him?"  
乌里尔，你确定，我是说绝对确定，那个人是阿齐拉费尔吗？也许你把一个人当成他了？

"I saw what I saw."  
我看到了我看到的。

"Yes, you said that. But you also said you couldn't sense him."  
是的，你说过那句话。但你也说过你感觉不到他。

"Neither of us could sense the demon Crowley posing as him either," Uriel retorted.  
乌里尔反驳道：“我们两个都没有察觉到克劳利伪装成他的恶魔。”

"Yes, but that was on stress and the demon Legion being around. The kid has an overwhelming and most peculiar aura."  
是的，但那是因为压力和恶魔军团在附近。这孩子有一种压倒性而又非常特殊的气场。

Uriel cast Raziel an exhausted, and a little baffled glance.  
乌里尔向拉齐尔投去一瞥，显得疲惫而有些困惑。

"Why are you always like that?" she asked, before looking back at Gabriel. "Gabriel, with your permission..."  
"你为什么总是这样？" 她问道，然后转身看着加布里埃尔。 "加布里埃尔，如果你允许的话..."

"Have you found Raphael yet?" Gabriel cut her off.  
"你找到拉斐尔了吗？" 加百列打断了她。

"Not yet." 还没有。

"Then please concentrate on that. I'd say we will need Raphael back here should push comes to shove as you worry."  
那么请专注于那个问题。我得说，如果情况紧急，我们可能需要拉斐尔回来，就像你担心的那样。

"You _do_ think Aziraphale is up to no good?"  
"你真的认为阿齐拉费尔有什么不好的意图吗？"

Gabriel looked blankly at Sandalphon.  
加百列茫然地看着桑达尔芬。

"I am certain there's a perfectly innocent explanation." He closed his eyes a little longer than necessary and drew a deep breath. "I shall see to this personally. Sandalphon, inform Michael she'll be keeping an eye on Heaven. Raziel... you keep an ear out. And Uriel..."  
我确信有一个完全无辜的解释。他闭上眼睛比必要的时间稍微久了一些，深吸了一口气。“我会亲自处理这件事。Sandalphon，告诉Michael她将会密切关注天堂。Raziel...你要保持警觉。而Uriel...

"Find Raphael, I heard you."  
找到拉斐尔，我听说了。

"Good." Gabriel smiled brightly. "Now then. Should anything come up, don't hesitate to inform me."  
"很好。" 加布里埃尔灿烂地笑了笑。"那么，如果有任何问题，请毫不犹豫地告诉我。"

He made an almost playful shooing gesture, and turned back to the window.  
他做了一个几乎像是在玩闹的赶走手势，然后转身回到窗前。

And faltered as soon as he was alone.  
当他独自一人时，他开始犹豫不决。

"_'Perfectly innocent explanation'_," someone said behind him. Michael. "Wasn't that also what you said about Aziraphale's fraternization with the demon Crowley?"  
“‘完全无辜的解释’，”他身后有人说道。迈克尔。“这不也是你对亚齐拉费尔与恶魔克劳利的交往所说的吗？”

Gabriel glared at her for a moment.  
加布里埃尔盯着她看了一会儿。

"How long have you been here?"  
你在这里待了多久了？

"Long enough," said Michael, stepping next to the other Archangel. "And I'm coming with you. Sandalphon can keep an eye on Heaven."  
"够长了，"迈克尔说着，走到另一个大天使旁边。“我会和你一起去的。桑达尔芬可以照看天堂。”

Gabriel shook his head. 加布里埃尔摇了摇头。

"Michael, this is certainly not necessary and..."  
迈克尔，这真的不必要，而且...

"Aziraphale is still a traitor. And with Hastur's influence on top of Crowley's I'd say shoot first, ask questions later."  
亚齐拉费尔仍然是个叛徒。再加上哈斯特对克劳利的影响，我会说先开枪，后问问题。

"Michael!" Gabriel stared at the other Archangel in disbelief.  
"迈克尔！" 加百列惊讶地盯着另一个大天使。

"As if you hadn't thought of it too," Michael retorted. "We have enough trouble with this mysterious surplus angel."  
"仿佛你也没有考虑过一样，"迈克尔反驳道。"我们已经对这个神秘的多余天使有足够的麻烦了。"

"Any progress in that regard?"  
在这方面有任何进展吗？

Michael blinked, only marginally thrown off. She should really have expected the question.  
迈克尔眨了眨眼，只是稍微有些困惑。她真的应该预料到这个问题。

"No. No miracles or anything."  
没有。没有奇迹或其他什么。

"You have spoken with Ligur, I assume."  
我猜你已经和利古尔交谈过了。

There was a tone in Gabriel's voice that sat absolutely not well with Michael. She wrinkled her nose in distaste.  
加布里埃尔的声音中有一种调子，让迈克尔感到非常不舒服。她皱起了鼻子，表示厌恶。

"He is one of us now, is he not?"  
他现在是我们其中的一员，不是吗？

Gabriel opened his mouth for a response, but snapped it closed so quickly that it managed to throw Michael off after all.  
加布里埃尔张开嘴巴准备回答，但是他迅速闭上嘴巴，这让迈克尔感到有些困惑。

"Alright, you can come with me," said Gabriel, in a tone that made Michael worry. "But once we've seen to this I want you to concentrate on the new angel."  
"好吧，你可以跟我来，" 加百列说道，语气让迈克尔感到担忧。"但是一旦我们处理完这件事，我希望你专注于新天使。"

Michael just nodded stoically.  
迈克尔默默点了点头。

"Come then," she said, but Gabriel shook his head.  
"那好吧，"她说道，但加百列摇了摇头。

"Not now. In two hours. I remember Aziraphale's erratic opening hours, and don't wish to give him an excuse to shoo out customers."  
现在不行。两个小时后。我记得阿齐拉费尔的不规律营业时间，不想给他找借口赶走顾客。

~⧖~

Hastur was wandering through the park, keeping close to the trees. He should have headed to the heart of the city. Lots of alleys to retreat to. Or the harbor. He liked being around boats, as much as some demons poked fun at him for it for a while now. Well, they had to file the paperwork for a new body, not him. They had it coming.  
Hastur在公园里漫步，靠近树木。他本应该前往城市的中心。有很多小巷可以撤退。或者去港口。他喜欢待在船旁边，尽管有些恶魔一直取笑他。好吧，他们得为新身体的文件办理手续，而不是他。他们活该。

Hastur rolled his shoulders and sat back against a tree, glaring heavenwards.  
哈斯特尔挺直了肩膀，背靠在一棵树上，怒视着天空。

"Ah, there you are," someone called and Hastur looked around.  
“啊，你在这里啊。”有人喊道，哈斯特尔四处张望。

"Must have rattled you pretty bad that you follow me like that, Principality. What is it?"  
你一定被吓得够呛，才会像这样跟着我，亲王。有什么事吗？

The other swallowed nervously.  
另一个人紧张地咽了口水。

"Look," he said. "I know I really should not assist you with any vile deeds..."  
“看着吧，”他说道。“我知道我真的不应该帮你做任何邪恶的事情……”

"Never had trouble assisting Crowley, didya?"  
从来没遇到过帮助克劳利有困难的，是吧？

A wince. "That... is different. And you know that. Anyway. This poor soul you are meant to drag to Hell."  
一阵痛苦的表情。“那个...不一样。你知道的。无论如何。你要把这个可怜的灵魂拖入地狱。”

Hastur quirked a brow. 哈斯特尔挑了挑眉毛。

"What about him?" 他怎么样？

"You see, I am acquainted with this gentleman, in passing I must add, but yet on a good enough basis to be able to tell you when he will be at home today."  
你看，我和这位先生有点熟悉，虽然只是过往的熟悉，但足够让我告诉你他今天会在家。

Hastur straightened. 哈斯特尔站直了身子。

"Bloody choirs, got y'rattled good if yer offering help."  
血腥的合唱团，如果你提供帮助，你就被吓坏了。

"I'm just seeing to the unpleasant matter concerning you and Crowley, that is all."  
我只是在处理与你和克劳利有关的不愉快事情，仅此而已。

"Is that so?" 是这样吗？

Hastur rose to full height, slinking over.  
哈斯特尔站起来，蹑手蹑脚地走过来。

Which was greeted with the other stepping back.  
其中一个退后，另一个则表示欢迎。

"Now, don't tell me yer scared." Hastur laughed curtly. "And if that's to pet me ego, yer doing a horrible job, Principality."  
"现在，别告诉我你害怕了。"哈斯图尔冷笑着说道。"如果你是为了讨好我，你做得很糟糕，大天使。"

"Do you want my help now or not?"  
你现在要不要我的帮助？

"Fine, fine." 好的，好的。

Hastur buried his hands in his pockets, rocking on his heels a little. It was kinda fun seeing Crowley's angel like that, as much as he - he begrudgingly had to admit - was warming up to his... he avoided the term _ward_.  
哈斯特把手插进口袋里，稍微晃动着脚后跟。看到克劳利像那样的天使，他觉得有点好玩，尽管他不情愿地承认，他对他的...他避免使用“被监护人”这个词。

"Here." 这里。

Hastur snatched the piece of paper held out to him.  
Hastur抓过递给他的纸条。

"Could've just told me the time," he said.  
他说：“本来可以告诉我时间的。”

"In case you might forget it."  
万一你忘了。

"Pff. 'M not _that_ scatterbrained, dun care what Crowley tells you."  
呸，我可不是那么心猿意马的人，才不管克劳利告诉你什么呢。

"About him. If you go to pick him up now, you should be at the address right on time. I shall hurry back now. Ta-ta."  
关于他。如果你现在去接他，你应该准时到达那个地址。我现在要赶回去了。拜拜。

Hastur watched him go, with a distinct amused bewilderment. Though he figured that Aziraphale was doing this for Crowley's sake, not his.  
哈斯特看着他离开，带着明显的愉悦和困惑。虽然他知道亚齐拉费尔这么做是为了克劳利，而不是为了他自己。

Well, Hastur mused, he could just do the job alone, reap in the laurels and get Crowley into troub-  
嗯，哈斯特沉思着，他可以独自完成这项工作，收获荣誉，让克劳利陷入麻烦中

Something deep inside him stirred and protested. And something else, located around the same area told him it'd be a horrible idea to not have Crowley with him.  
他内心深处有一种激动和抗议的情绪。还有另一种感觉，就在同一区域，告诉他如果没有克劳利陪伴会是一个可怕的主意。

Hastur had vowed to himself to listen to his gut.  
哈斯特尔曾发誓要倾听自己的直觉。

He turned to march towards Mayfair.  
他转身向梅费尔大道行进。

~⧖~

"Alright, cards on the table," said Crowley, flopping down on the couch next to Ligur with a cup of tea. It had been an incredibly boring couple of days so far, and by now Crowley was almost inclined to just go and get the whole dragging-to-Hell thing done. He somehow wondered if Hastur was simply not doing it to get him to do the dirty work.  
“好了，摊牌吧。”克劳利说着，带着一杯茶坐到了利古尔旁边的沙发上。这几天过得无比无聊，克劳利几乎有点倾向于去完成那个把人拖入地狱的任务。他不禁怀疑哈斯特尔是不是故意不去做，让他来干这脏活。

But that wasn't of importance now.  
但现在那并不重要。

"How's being an angel again working out for you?"  
做个天使又怎么样？

Ligur quirked a brow at him.  
利古尔皱起了眉毛看着他。

"Took you longer t'ask than I'd expected."  
你问的比我预料的要久。

Crowley harrumphed casually, leaning back.  
克劳利随意地咕哝了一声，向后靠去。

"So... gonna answer?" 那么...准备回答了吗？

"Might as well humor you," said Ligur, leaning back as well.  
"既然你这么说，我也就陪你一下吧，" 李格尔说着，也向后靠了靠。

The chameleon was off dozing amongst Crowley's houseplants, something that annoyed Crowley to no end and thus was a fountain of amusement and mild satisfaction to Ligur.  
变色龙正在克劳利的盆栽植物中打盹，这让克劳利非常恼火，但对利古尔来说却是一大乐事，让他感到满足。

"I hate it," the former demon stated bluntly.  
“我讨厌它。”前恶魔直言不讳地说道。

Crowley cocked his head. 克劳利歪了一下头。

"Odd to hear that from someone who was so keen on winning Armageddon and all."  
从一个如此渴望赢得末日审判的人那里听到这样的话确实有些奇怪。

"Not the same, an' you know that." Ligur grumbled. "An' you said cards on the table. Y'wanna know if you gots a chance of getting back upstairs, right?"  
"不一样，你知道的。"利格尔抱怨道。"而且你说过要坦诚相对。你想知道自己有没有机会回到楼上，对吧？"

Crowley pouted. 克劳利撅嘴了。

"No," he lied. "不，" 他撒谎了。

"Yer not even trying to sound convincing." Ligur smiled lopsided. "If you wanna dive head first into Holy Water to try an' to get back into the Choirs, be my guest."  
你连试图说服的样子都没有。利格尔一边笑着，一边歪了歪嘴。“如果你想头朝下地跳进圣水里，试图重新进入合唱团，那就随你的便吧。”

"Well..." Crowley grimaced.  
"嗯..." 克劳利皱了皱眉。

"We both know this is another of the Almighty's _little jokes_." Ligur shook his head. "It's not as if I was even welcomed Up There."  
我们都知道这只是全能者的又一个小玩笑。”利古尔摇了摇头。“就算我上去也不会受到欢迎。”

"Huh?" "嗯？"

Ligur rolled his shoulders and stared grimly into the distance for a moment.  
利古尔挺直了肩膀，一脸严肃地望向远方片刻。

"Had Michael not put a word in for me, I'd not be here."  
如果没有迈克尔替我说句话，我就不会在这里了。

Crowley whipped his head around, spilled some tea in the process, and stared at Ligur.  
克劳利猛地转过头，顺带溅了些茶水，盯着利古尔。

"Michael? The Archangel Michael?"  
"迈克尔？大天使迈克尔？"

"No, Michael Sheen, the actor... Of course the Archangel." He took a deep breath. "Gabriel and Sandalphon were certain 'twas some test and wanted to... well, you can guess. Sands more than Gabriel..."  
"不，迈克尔·辛，那个演员...当然是大天使。"他深吸了一口气。“加百列和桑达尔芬确信这是某种考验，想要...嗯，你可以猜到。桑德斯比加百列更加..."

"And Michael spoke up on your behalf?"  
"迈克尔替你说话了吗？"

Ligur nodded. 利古尔点了点头。

"Michael..." He sighed, and shook his head. "Crowley, Heaven's not for me. And it's not for you either."  
"迈克尔..." 他叹了口气，摇了摇头。"克劳利，天堂不适合我。也不适合你。"

Crowley simply wrinkled his nose. Ligur was having none of it.  
克劳利只是皱了皱鼻子。利古尔对此毫不在意。

"Dun gimme that face," he said, soberly. "Yer pissed you Fell for askin' question. Been lamenting 'bout it often enough. Never understood why yer so keen on getting back into Heaven."  
他冷静地说道：“别给我那种表情。你生气了，因为你傻乎乎地问了个问题。你一直在为此而懊悔。我从来不明白你为什么那么渴望回到天堂。”

With an accusing expression, Crowley put the cup down and stood up, looking hurt.  
克劳利带着指责的表情放下杯子，站起身来，一脸受伤的样子。

"I only ever ask questions, you got that right. I didn't even fight... It's..."  
我只是问问题，你说得对。我甚至没有争吵过...这就是...

"Not fair? The entire kicking us... _you_ out of Heaven thing wasn't fair." Ligur frowned, sipping his own tea." Yer not special, Crowley. 'Only ever asked questions'. You an' about three quarters of all demons in Hell."  
"不公平？把我们赶出天堂的整件事情就不公平。"利古尔皱着眉头，喝着自己的茶。“克劳利，你没什么特别的。只是一直在问问题而已。你和地狱里大约四分之三的恶魔一样。”

"Mhnn?" "嗯？"

"Did you never think 'bout how many of us... well, _you_ Fell 'cause we... ah, bugger it, we only ever asked questions? An' you _did_ fight. 'Cause you wanted answers, dun be like that."  
你从来没想过我们中有多少人... 嗯，你倒下是因为我们... 啊，见鬼，我们只是一直在问问题？而你曾经战斗过。因为你想要答案，别这样。

Crowley quirked a brow. 克劳利挑了挑眉毛。

"You sound like Hastur now. He said the same."  
你现在听起来像哈斯特了。他说了同样的话。

"'Cause we talked 'bout this, what did you think?" Ligur snorted, amused, but with a melancholic undertone. "Hastur fought and Fell because he wanted to understand things. Cause he saw that things could work differently. But he was only ever told to do it Her way or not at all. In the end we rebelled cause neither o' us would stand someone like that. Someone wouldn't even answer the most simple, most innocent questions, but demanded we jump whenever we're told t' jump. You've been there, y'know how it went."  
“因为我们谈过这个问题，你当时是怎么想的？”利古尔嗤笑着，带着一丝忧郁的语气。“哈斯特尔战斗并堕落，是因为他想要理解事物。因为他看到事物可以以不同的方式运作。但他只被告知要按照她的方式去做，否则就别做。最后我们反抗了，因为我们都无法容忍像那样的人。一个连最简单、最无辜的问题都不愿回答，却要求我们按她的指示跳起来的人。你也经历过那些，你知道它是怎么回事。”

Crowley nodded glumly. 克劳利黯然点头。

And paused. 然后停顿了一下。

"What do you mean 'Hastur Fell 'cause he wanted...'..."  
“你是什么意思说‘哈斯特尔倒下是因为他想要……’…”

He didn't get any further. The moment the first trace of amusement about this had crossed his features Ligur had sprung up, slammed Crowley against the wall, his hand on Crowley's throat.  
他没有再进一步。当他脸上第一丝娱乐的表情出现时，利古尔立刻跳起来，将克劳利猛地推到墙上，手掐住了克劳利的喉咙。

"If this is goin' to make fun of Hastur I'll just conveniently forget 'm not s'posed to kill you, you ungrateful brat." Ligur barred his teeth, blunt nails sinking into skin.  
如果这是要取笑哈斯特尔的话，我就方便地忘记我不应该杀了你，你这个不知感恩的小鬼。利古尔露出了牙齿，钝钉深深地刺入皮肤。

"Ngk," said Crowley, struggling only a little, either too panicked to move, or having enough common sense to not aggravate the former demon further.  
“Ngk，”克劳利说着，稍微挣扎了一下，可能是因为过于恐慌而无法移动，或者是出于足够的常识而不愿进一步激怒这位前恶魔。

"I'm sick of you an' ev'ryone mocking him day in day out," snarled Ligur. "He was only ever doing his job an' trying to keep you out of trouble."  
"我受够了你和每个人天天嘲笑他，"利格尔咆哮道。"他只是在尽职尽责，试图让你们远离麻烦。"

"What?" 什么？

Ligur made an odd hissing noise.  
利古尔发出了奇怪的嘶嘶声。

"Y'really dun get it." 你真的不明白。

Crowley coughed as Ligur let go of him, and rubbed his throat.  
克劳利被利古尔放开后咳嗽了一声，揉了揉喉咙。

"What do you mean?" 你是什么意思？

"He's gone putting his head on the choppin block for you time an' time again. Told him it'd do him no good. He didn't listen..." Ligur frowned. "Why'm I tellin' you this? You dun even care." He buried his hands in his pockets and turned on his heel. "I'll go for a walk. You stay where you are."  
他一次又一次为了你去冒险，置头砍块。我告诉他这样做没有好处，可他不听……"利格尔皱了皱眉头。“我为什么要告诉你这些？你根本不在乎。”他把手插进口袋，转身离开。“我去散散步，你就呆在这里吧。”

Crowley had only managed to get back onto his feet as the door closed behind Ligur.  
克劳利勉强站起身来，就在利古尔关上门的时候。

With a long sigh he sat back down on the couch, only looking up as he heard the by now familiar clacking of Ligur's chameleon.  
他长长地叹了口气，重新坐回沙发上，只是在听到利古尔的变色龙发出的熟悉的咔嗒声时抬起头来。

"You just missed your master," Crowley said as the little creature climbed up onto the table and dipped its snout into the lukewarm tea.  
“你刚错过了你的主人，”克劳利说道，当那个小生物爬上桌子，把鼻子伸进微温的茶水中。

"At least you're having fun."  
至少你玩得开心。

Crowley leaned back and stared at the ceiling. "Ligur tried to tell me Hastur cared for me. Pff, in what reality is he living in."  
克劳利向后靠在椅子上，凝视着天花板。“利古尔试图告诉我哈斯特对我有感情。呸，他活在哪个现实世界里？”

We have to go on a small, but extremely important tangent concerning the so-called multiverse here.  
我们必须就所谓的多元宇宙问题进行一个小而极其重要的离题讨论。

Most scholars, as well as intelligent beings, will agree that God would be an omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent being. They are broadly correct. The detail they are missing is that God would also be sentient, thus being all-knowing would be dreadfully, if not to say god-awfully, boring.  
大多数学者和聪明的生物都会同意，上帝应该是一个全知、全能和无所不在的存在。他们的观点基本正确。他们忽略的细节是，上帝也应该是有感知能力的，因此，全知全能将会是极其乏味的，甚至可以说是令人厌烦的。

Especially if there were jus one singular reality.  
尤其是如果只有一个独特的现实存在。

Thank God that there isn't.  
感谢上帝，没有这样的事情。

There's thousands upon thousands of timelines, all different from each other to varying degrees. Let's look at Crowley for example:  
有成千上万个时间线，彼此之间都有不同程度的差异。让我们以克劳利为例：

Right now he is sitting on a white leather couch in a shiny loft flat, pondering about what just happened. In another reality the flat is much darker and sombre, just like its inhabitant, in others only the color of Crowley's shirt differs. In some he's not even the owner of the flat anymore, due to some mishaps with certain not very demon-friendly liquids.\*  
现在他正坐在一张白色皮沙发上，思考着刚刚发生的事情。在另一个现实中，公寓更加昏暗和忧郁，就像它的居住者一样，而在其他现实中，只有克劳利的衬衫颜色不同。在某些现实中，由于与某些不太友好的恶魔液体发生了一些意外，他甚至不再是公寓的主人了。

\*E.g. managing to spill the thermos on the carpet just after receiving it, leading to Crowley throwing balled-up paper towels at the puddle from a safe distance and then switching flats.  
例如，在刚收到保温瓶后不久，竟然把它洒在地毯上，导致克劳利从安全距离向水坑扔纸巾，然后换了公寓。

In other realities it would not even be Crowley sitting here. It could be Aziraphale, it could be anyone, it could be no one. Maybe the flat doesn't even exist.  
在其他现实中，这里甚至不会有克劳利坐在这里。它可能是阿齐拉费尔，可能是任何人，甚至可能没有人。也许这个公寓甚至不存在。

Thousands upon thousands of realities, and God arranged to only know the immediate future of the one She's temporarily dwelling in.  
成千上万个现实，上帝只安排了她暂时寄居的那一个现实的即时未来。

And albeit Crowley, as well as probably many others, would have been surprised to learn this, the answer to his initial question would have surprised him even more.  
虽然克劳利和可能许多其他人都会对此感到惊讶，但对他最初的问题的答案会让他更加惊讶。

And maybe it still will.  
也许它仍然会。

Crowley rubbed his eyes with a groan, just as the doorbell rang.  
克劳利闷声闷气地揉了揉眼睛，就在门铃响起的时候。

"That was either quick or he forgot his keys," he murmured at the chameleon, who gave him the look-equivalent of a shrug, hopped off the couch and skittered back to Crowley's plants.  
他低声嘀咕着对变色龙说：“要么他很快就回来了，要么他忘记带钥匙了。”变色龙无奈地看了他一眼，从沙发上跳下来，匆匆忙忙地回到克劳利的植物那边。

Crowley meanwhile got up, and mentally went through a few things to say as he headed for the door.  
克劳利同时站起身来，心里默默地回想了一些要说的话，然后朝门口走去。

To his surprise it wasn't Ligur waiting for him.  
令他惊讶的是，并不是Ligur在等他。

"Hastur. What brings you here? Ligur just left, you missed him."  
哈斯特。你来这里有什么事？利古刚刚离开，你错过了他。

It had not been information intended to hurt the older demon, but the way Hastur's brow furrowed, it had not failed to do just that.  
这并不是要伤害那位年长的恶魔的信息，但哈斯图尔皱起的眉头却无疑做到了。

"We got a job t'do, remember?" Hastur snarled. "Come."  
"我们有工作要做，记住了吗？"哈斯特咆哮道。"走吧。"

"The dragging-to-Hell thing? Didn't you..."  
"那个拖入地狱的事情？你不是..."

"I said _'come'_." 我说：“来。”

Crowley decided against bringing up Ligur - and how he was supposed to A) tell Ligur where he went, and B) stay at the flat - again, and hastily put on his glasses. Maybe it was still the aftermath of what Ligur had said, but Crowley decided not to antagonize the older demon further, and instead just followed along.  
克劳利决定不再提及利格尔——他该如何告诉利格尔他去了哪里，以及如何再次留在公寓里——他匆忙戴上了眼镜。也许这还是利格尔之前说的话的余波，但克劳利决定不再进一步激怒这位年长的恶魔，而是选择顺从地跟随着。

~⧖~

"I don't much appreciate you ruining my couch."  
我不太欣赏你弄脏我的沙发。

Asmodeus paced back and forth in his office, trying to keep a definite distance between himself and Leviathan. He really wasn't too keen on fish.  
阿斯莫德在办公室里来回踱步，试图保持与利维坦之间的明确距离。他对鱼真的不太感兴趣。

"I am aware. But dire times. And you won't meet me in my lair."  
我知道。但是现在是危急时刻。而且你不会在我的巢穴里见到我。

Asmodeus just nodded stoically.  
阿斯莫德只是坚定地点了点头。

"Kindly use longer sentences, you're not sending a wire, paying by the letter."  
请使用更长的句子，你不是在发电报，也不是按字母付费。

Leviathan flexed their webbed fingers.  
利维坦伸展了他们的蹼状手指。

"As you wish." 随你的意愿。

"So," Asmodeus sat down behind his desk, propping his feet up on it. "Mammon. What's Mr Goldfinger done now?"  
"那么，"阿斯莫德坐在办公桌后，把脚搁在桌上。“玛蒙，金手指先生又做了什么？”

"Made a bet with you, but you know as much. Why doesn't it strike you as odd?"  
和你打赌，但你也知道一样多。为什么你不觉得这很奇怪呢？

"Oh, it does strike me as odd. I had hitherto assumed Mammon would know better." Asmodeus rubbed his chin.  
哦，这确实让我感到奇怪。我之前一直以为魔王会更明智一些。阿斯莫德摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩斯摩

"Then again," said Leviathan, "we are talking about Hastur here. He's a capable demon but..."  
“再说了，”利维坦说道，“我们现在谈论的是哈斯特。他是一个有能力的恶魔，但是……”

Asmodeus' brow furrowed. 阿斯莫德的眉头紧锁。

"I will not permit any ill talk of my pet in my office, capiche?"  
我不会允许在我的办公室里对我的宠物说任何不好的话，明白吗？

Leviathan let out a laugh reminescent of the mustache-twirling villains of movies from days gone by.  
利维坦发出了一声笑声，让人回想起过去电影中那些扭着胡子的恶棍。

"Gotcha," they grinned, showing a too broad grin with too sharp teeth. "I was to compliment him." Leviathan rose, stalking over to the desk and sitting down on it. Asmodeus pointedly moved his paperwork away.  
“明白了，”他们咧嘴一笑，露出过于宽广的笑容和过于锋利的牙齿。“我本来是要夸他的。”利维坦站起身，迈着大步走向桌子，坐了上去。阿斯莫德有意地将他的文件移到一边。

"Curious to see you care so much for the Duke, Asmodeus."  
好奇你如此关心公爵，阿斯莫德。

"He's one of the best horses in my stable." Asmodeus leaned back, steepling his fingers together. "So let that be my concern."  
他是我马厩里最好的马之一。阿斯莫德斯向后靠着，双手交叉在一起。"所以，让这成为我的责任吧。"

"I intend to." 我打算这么做。

"You don't sound as if you would bet against yours truly."  
你听起来好像不会对我打赌。

"You know me, Asmodeus." Leviathan spun on the desk, planting their feet on the armrests of the other Archdemon's chair and leaning forward till they were nose to nose with Asmodeus. "I don't do _bets_."  
"你认识我，阿斯莫德。"利维坦转身坐在桌子上，把脚放在另一个大恶魔椅子的扶手上，向前倾身，直到与阿斯莫德的鼻子贴在一起。“我不赌。”

Asmodeus snarled briefly, pushing the other out of his face.  
阿斯莫德短暂地咆哮着，将另一个人推开。

"You got as big a stick up your behind as Gabriel, I haven't forgotten." He caught the fist mid-punch. "So predictable."  
你和加布里埃尔一样，屁股里插了根大棍子，我可没忘记。他在拳头即将打中时抓住了它。“太容易预测了。”

Leviathan snarled and withdrew their hand.  
利维坦咆哮着，收回了他们的手。

"I don't like that name."  
我不喜欢那个名字。

"And I don't like fish, yet here we are." Asmodeus leaned back. "So..." he drawled the word out. "Do you think Mammon has some ace up his sleeve?"  
“而且我不喜欢吃鱼，可我们还是来到这里了。”阿斯莫德斯靠在椅背上。“那么……”他慢吞吞地说道。“你觉得玛门有什么底牌吗？”

Leviathan nodded stoically.  
利维坦沉默地点了点头。

"He's more full of himself than ever. And you know the rumors about the Master?"  
他比以往更自以为是。而你知道关于那位大师的传闻吗？

Asmodeus quirked a mildly interested brow.  
阿斯莫德微微挑起了一条略带兴趣的眉毛。

"They say he left Hell. Which is impossible."  
他们说他离开了地狱。这是不可能的。

Again Leviathan nodded dryly.  
利维坦再次干巴巴地点了点头。

"What do you think?" 你觉得呢？

"It's Lucifer we are talking about. If anyone can find a loophole in Her work it's him." Asmodeus playfully pushed Leviathan's boot off the armsrest. "And you? You think Mammon's after the throne?"  
"我们在谈论的是路西法。如果有人能找到她工作中的漏洞，那就是他。”阿斯莫德开玩笑地把利维坦的靴子从扶手上推开。“那你呢？你觉得玛门是在追求王位？”

Another nod. 又点了点头。

"You know him, Asmodeus."  
你认识他，阿斯莫德斯。

"We both do, Leviathan. But... let's assume Lou is genuinely gone from Hell. Even Mammon, no matter how blinded by greed, isn't harebrained enough to go up against the rest of... not just the council, but all of Hell... to try and claim the throne."  
我们都知道，利维坦。但是...假设露从地狱真的离开了。即使是贪婪蒙蔽了双眼的玛门，也不会蠢到与整个地狱的...不仅仅是议会，而是整个地狱...对抗，试图夺取王位。

"Oh, he _is_ enough of a stupid arse to try."  
哦，他足够愚蠢到敢尝试。

Asmodeus laughed. 阿斯莫德笑了。

"He and what army, though? There's hardly a soul in Hell who'd help him with such endeavor."  
他凭什么？地狱里几乎没有人会帮他完成这样的事业。

Leviathan locked eyes with the other demon.  
利维坦与另一个恶魔对视着。

"Not willingly, no." 不情愿，不。

Asmodeus fell silent and furrowed his brows darkly.  
阿斯莫德沉默下来，脸上阴沉地皱起了眉头。

"Leviathan. I think we should get Beelzebub involved..."  
利维坦。我觉得我们应该让贝利亚卷入其中...

~⧖~

"Gonna be honest for a second here," said Crowley, rocking on his heels, eyes fixed on the narrow building. "I'd have missed that."  
克劳利晃动着脚跟，眼睛盯着那座狭窄的建筑物，他坦白地说道：“说实话，我会错过它。”

Hastur scrunched his nose up.  
哈斯特皱了皱鼻子。

"Yer up here for 6000 years. You ought to've seen weirder."  
你在这里已经待了6000年了。你应该见过更奇怪的事情了。

"Weirder, yeah. But barely narrower."  
更奇怪，是的。但几乎没有更窄。

Hastur looked the younger demon up and down. "You hung 'round the fancy parts of life too often, Crowley. Didn't do you well."  
哈斯特仔细打量着那个年轻的恶魔。"克劳利，你总是在那些高档场所晃荡，可没给你带来好处。"

"What's that supposed to mean?" protested Crowley, following Hastur across the street.  
克劳利抗议道：“那是什么意思？”他跟着哈斯特穿过街道。

"Yer too posh for yer own good," said Hastur, gesturing casually.  
“你太高雅了，自以为是。”哈斯图尔随意地挥手说道。

"I have a quota to fill, you know?"  
我有一个指标要完成，你知道的吧？

Hastur stopped, giving Crowley a small, unimpressed glare.  
哈斯特停下来，对克劳利投以一种小小的、不以为然的怒视。

"What did I say about jokes?" he growled. "Yer no proper demon, so dun gimme that."  
“我说过什么关于开玩笑的？”他咆哮道。“你不是个正经的恶魔，别跟我来这一套。”

Hastur inspected the door, while Crowley sidled up to him.  
哈斯特检查了门，而克劳利则悄悄靠近他。

"What's _that_ supposed to mean?"  
这是什么意思？

Hastur looked at him coldly.  
哈斯特冷冷地看着他。

"Y'know wot I mean." With a flick of his hand the door sprung open and he pushed into the small hallway. "Mr 'I only hung out with the wrong crowd'."  
“你知道我在说什么。”他挥了挥手，门弹了开来，他推开门走进了狭小的走廊。“那位‘我只和坏人混在一起的’先生。”

Crowley groaned and followed into the building, closing the door behind himself.  
克劳利呻吟着跟进建筑物，关上门。

"Did I somehow miss it being 'nag-crowley-for-his-opinion-day' today? What is it with you people and bringing that up now?"  
我是不是错过了今天是“纠缠克劳利发表意见日”的节日？你们这些人为什么现在又提起这个？

"Steady drippin' and stuff. Beats me."  
稳定地滴着，什么鬼。 beats me.

Crowley frowned, unamused.  
克劳利皱了皱眉头，不感兴趣。

"Oh c'mon. I'm not that bad."  
哎呀，别这样嘛。我又不是那么糟糕。

"That's the problem." 这就是问题所在。

"...No, I meant I'm not constantly harping on it."  
“不，我的意思是我不会一直唠叨这件事。”

Hastur considered that. And shrugged.  
哈斯特尔考虑了一下，然后耸了耸肩。

"Y'harp on it enough to be annoying. But I guess you could be more of a pain in the arse."  
你老是唠叨这个，真是让人烦透了。不过我猜你可能还能更让人头疼。

Hastur craned his neck peeking up the steep narrow staircase leading up into the darkness of the upper floors.  
哈斯特伸长脖子，往上看着通往上层楼暗处的陡峭狭窄楼梯。

"Got discorporated breaking me neck on one o' these," he murmured, swinging onto the stairs.  
"摔断了脖子，把我给弄得魂飞魄散了，"他低声嘀咕着，摇摆着走上了楼梯。

"You're going to look around down here first?" said Crowley, making sure the front door was locked as it should be.  
克劳利说道：“你先在这里四处看看？”他确保前门锁好了，就像应该的那样。

"Naw. My source says the guy's not here, so we can very well wait somewhere more comf'table. Get movin'."  
算了。我的消息说那个人不在这里，所以我们可以去一个更舒适的地方等待。赶快动起来。

He climbed the stairs to the first landing, checking the rooms around.  
他爬上楼梯到达一楼平台，检查周围的房间。

"Living room. That should do," he said.  
客厅。就这样吧，他说道。

Crowley moved next to him peeking over his shoulder.  
克劳利移动到他身旁，偷偷地从他肩膀后面窥视。

"The guy's taste is sin enough, I give Downstairs that much."🔄  ❓

The interior design was a mess indeed.  
室内设计确实一团糟。

Everything was that special kind of antique that was already out of date at the time it was state-of-the-art.  
一切都是那种特别的古董，即使在当时它们还是最先进的，但已经过时了。

"Oh, Aziraphale would love this," Crowley said in a tone that added a whole new definition to 'abject horror'.  
“哦，阿齐拉费尔会喜欢这个的。”克劳利语气中充满了“绝对恐怖”的全新定义。

"That'd explain some things." Hastur beelined to the far too frilly couch and flopped down. Crowley, still leaning in the doorway and making a face as if he feared the myriads of tassels would strangle him, was about to say something when a gentle but irritating hiss cut through the silence.  
"这可以解释一些事情。" 哈斯图尔径直走向过于花哨的沙发，瘫倒在上面。克劳利还站在门口，脸上带着一副担心无数流苏会勒死他的表情，正要说些什么，突然一阵轻柔却让人烦躁的嘶嘶声打破了寂静。

Both demons turned, and almost in unison quirked a brow at a couple of small, pale-green air humidifiers standing throughout the room.  
两个恶魔转过身，几乎同时对房间里摆放着的几个小巧、淡绿色的空气加湿器皱起了眉。

After a slightly dragged-out moment of silence, Crowley's shoulders slumped in defeat.  
在稍微拖延的沉默片刻后，克劳利的肩膀无力地垂下来，他感到了失败的沮丧。

"Oh, for crying out loud," he mumbled, rubbing his temples.  
"哎呀，真是让人火大啊，"他嘟囔着，揉着太阳穴。

"And now we wait," said Hastur, coughing briefly.  
“现在我们等待。”哈斯特尔咳嗽了一下，说道。

Minutes ticked by, until Crowley, with another sigh of defeat turned on his heel.  
时间一分一秒地过去，直到克劳利又叹了口气，无奈地转身离开。

"I'll go and check the rest of the house."  
我去检查一下房子的其他部分。

Hastur simply harrumphed, leaning back on the couch. He drummed his fingers on the upholstery, coughing roughly from time to time.  
哈斯特尔只是咕哝了一声，靠在沙发上向后仰。他在沙发上敲打着手指，不时咳嗽着。

"You don't sound too well," said Crowley, returning after another five minutes.  
“你听起来不太好。”克劳利说道，又过了五分钟后回来了。

"Eh, only half as bad as you look."  
嘿，只有你看起来那么糟糕的一半糟糕。

Crowley frowned. 克劳利皱了皱眉头。

"I'm trying to be civil here, and..."  
我在这里尽力保持礼貌，而且...

"Civil my arse. You an' the bloody Principality are playing yer own games again, an' I gotta do the cleanin' up as always. I'm jus' sick of it."  
文明个屁。你和那该死的公国又在玩你们自己的游戏，而我又得像往常一样来收拾烂摊子。我真是受够了。

"Talk about mood whiplash. Where did that aggression come from just now?"  
说到情绪的急转弯。刚才那种攻击性是从哪里冒出来的？

"'Tis been there the whole time."  
这一直在那里。

The frown deepened. 皱眉加深了。

"Is this about the Armageddon thing? You know She fooled all of us with that stunt. But everything's fine."  
这是关于末日大战的事情吗？你知道她用那个把戏愚弄了我们所有人。但是一切都好。

Hastur glared. 哈斯特尔怒视着。

"You call _that_ fine?!" He gestured.  
"你觉得这算好的？！" 他做了个手势。

"What? That Earth still stands? Yeah?" Crowley bristled. He was feeling dizzy, and that didn't really help his temper. Although a tiny voice told him that the past two years might have been worse for Hastur than for him.  
"什么？那个地球还在？是吗？" 克劳利生气地说道。他感到头晕，这并没有帮助他的脾气。尽管有一个小声音告诉他，过去的两年对哈斯特尔可能比对他更糟糕。

Not that he ever listened to that voice in moments like this.  
在这种时刻，他从来不会听那个声音。

"You should be grateful, Hastur."  
你应该感激，哈斯特尔。

"Grateful?" Hastur spat. "For what? All the shit y'put me through? Wi' them past two years being the worst of it all?"  
"感激？"哈斯特咬牙切齿地说道。"为了什么？为了你给我带来的所有糟糕事情？这过去的两年是最糟糕的吗？"

"What, 'cause of the thing with Ligur?" Crowley began to snarl. "He's back now, isn't he? And don't act as if a you of all people would have been mour-"  
“什么，因为和利古尔的那件事？”克劳利开始咆哮起来。“他现在回来了，不是吗？别装作你这样的人会为了一个-”

Hastur jumped up. 哈斯特尔跳了起来。

"They didn't give me time to!" he barked back, seething. Crowley snapped his mouth shut and stared at him.  
“他们没给我时间！”他愤怒地咆哮着回应道。克劳利闭上嘴巴，盯着他。

"What?" 什么？

Hastur looked away. "Forget it."  
哈斯特转过头去。“算了。”

"No. No. You tell me what that comment meant."  
不，不行。你告诉我那个评论是什么意思。

Hastur just glared, his whole frame shaking.  
哈斯特尔只是怒视着，整个身体都在颤抖着。

"It dun matter," he said, coughed and rubbed his throat.  
他说：“没关系。”他咳嗽了一下，揉了揉喉咙。

"Yes it does." 是的，它确实如此。

"Shut up!" 闭嘴！

"No! If you'll be on Aziraphale's toes for the next few centuries and we can at worst make each other mildly miserable, I _want_ to know what happened."  
不！如果你在接下来的几个世纪里一直跟着阿齐拉费尔，我们最多也只会让彼此稍微不开心，我想知道发生了什么事情。

And then Hastur let out an agonized screech.  
然后哈斯特发出一声痛苦的尖叫。

"What do you think happened?" he cried out, face pure wrath and agony. "Hell couldn't punish you, so take a fucking guess who they turned their attention to."  
"你觉得发生了什么事？"他大声喊道，脸上充满了愤怒和痛苦。"地狱无法惩罚你，那么猜猜他们转向了谁。"

Crowley had been take aback by the initial outburst, but now just wrinkled his nose.  
克劳利一开始被突如其来的爆发吓了一跳，但现在只是皱了皱鼻子。

"Don't gimme that, Hastur. Look at you. You're still here. Sure, your wing's a mess, but, man, Hell went soft on you."  
别给我这一套，哈斯特。看看你自己。你还在这里呢。没错，你的翅膀一团糟，但是，兄弟，地狱对你太宽容了。

Hastur stood up straight. Crowley braced for another outburst from the other demon. Some raving and ranting, maybe some screeching, all because he felt mistreated. But wasn't Crowley right? Hastur was alive. Not just that, but aside from his wing he looked better than ever.  
哈斯特尔挺直了身子。克劳利为另一个恶魔的爆发做好了准备。一些疯狂的咆哮和抱怨，也许还有一些尖叫，都是因为他感到受到了不公平的对待。但克劳利不是对的吗？哈斯特尔还活着。不仅如此，除了他的翅膀之外，他看起来比以往任何时候都要好。

But no outburst came. 但是没有爆发出来。

Instead Hastur unfurled his wings without a sound (aside from one of the humidifiers being knocked over) and caught Crowley's eyes.  
哈斯特展开了他的翅膀，毫无声息地（除了一个加湿器被撞倒的声音），并吸引了克劳利的目光。

And changed. 已经改变了。

Crowley staggered back. 克劳利踉跄后退。

He had always enjoyed sleep, but with what he was seeing before him burned into his memory he might think twice about that and dreaming from now on.  
他一直喜欢睡觉，但是眼前所见深深烙印在他的记忆中，或许他会重新考虑一下以后的睡眠和梦境。

"This' what I looked like two months after your lil stunt," said Hastur, flatly, his lips still knitting themselves together as he shifted back. "And only the bloody Almighty above knows how long it'd have continued hadn't I manage to make a run for it." Hastur slumped back down onto the couch, coughing heavily. "Y'really think Hell would've gone soft on me? 'Specially after all what happened?" He shook his head and searched his pockets for a cigarette. "Dunno how I even managed that. Gettin' away I mean. All I can remember was winding up in the darkest corner o' Purgatory."  
“这就是你小把戏之后两个月的我，”哈斯特平淡地说道，他的嘴唇还在缝合，他向后挪动着。“只有上面那位血腥的全能者知道，要不是我设法逃脱，这事可能会持续多久。”哈斯特瘫坐在沙发上，咳嗽得很重。“你真以为地狱会对我手下留情吗？尤其是在发生了那么多事之后？”他摇了摇头，搜索口袋里的香烟。“我都不知道我是怎么做到的。逃脱，我是说。我只记得自己最后落到了炼狱最黑暗的角落。”

Crowley shifted his weight.  
克劳利转移了他的重心。

For a demon he had a couple of major failings, that could however all be summed up as one thing:  
对于一个恶魔来说，他有几个重大的缺点，然而这些缺点都可以归结为一件事：

He had a heart. 他有一颗心。

And as much as he...  
尽管他...

Crowley paused. 克劳利停顿了一下。

He had been wondering why he felt so sorry, was even worried for Hastur. After all, he... And that was the issue. Hate was not the right word, now that he thought about it. Despise? No. Annoyance? Yes, but that wasn't right either.  
他一直在想为什么他感到如此难过，甚至为哈斯特尔感到担忧。毕竟，他...这就是问题所在。恨不是正确的词，现在他想起来了。鄙视？不。烦恼？是的，但那也不对。

He didn't know what it was exactly he felt for the senior demon.  
他不知道自己对那位高级恶魔究竟是什么感觉。

But he knew he should say something. But what? Apologize? What for? Stopping the Apocalypse? Trying not to die brutally? All he had done was try to save his own hide. Very demonic. Hastur should appreciate that, he'd always noted how demons don't go around...  
但他知道他应该说些什么。但是什么呢？道歉？为什么？阻止末日？试图不被残忍地杀死？他所做的一切只是为了保命。非常恶魔般。哈斯图尔应该会欣赏这一点，他一直注意到恶魔不会四处乱跑...

Ligur's words came back to Crowley and kicked him full-force in the arse.  
利古尔的话回到克劳利身上，狠狠地踢了他一脚。

He looked at Hastur again, and myriads of memories tumbled over him.  
他再次看着哈斯图尔，无数的回忆涌上心头。

Quietly he sat down next to the older demon, took off his sunglasses, and just stared ahead. After a moment he rubbed his throat.  
他静静地坐在老恶魔旁边，摘下太阳镜，默默地望着前方。片刻后，他揉了揉喉咙。

"Bloody dry air in here 'spite those blasted spray-things," said Hastur to fill the silence.  
“这里的空气太他妈的干了，尽管有那些该死的喷雾器。”哈斯特尔说着，打破了寂静。

Crowley grinned weakly. 克劳利苦笑着。

"No, that's not why..." Then his eyes widened. "Shit!" He grabbed Hastur's face and stared at the other demon in growing panic.  
“不，不是因为这个……”然后他的眼睛瞪大了。“该死！”他抓住哈斯图尔的脸，惊慌地盯着另一个恶魔。

"Wot?" "什么？"

Hastur coughed again, swooning a little and rubbing his chest.  
哈斯特再次咳嗽了一声，有些晕眩地揉着胸口。

"You're bleeding!" 你在流血！

Trying hard to focus on the lower demon, Hastur ran his sleeve over his mouth, gazing down at the almost black stains it left. Crowley let out a wince.  
哈斯特努力集中注意力在那个较低级的恶魔身上，他用袖子擦了擦嘴，凝视着留下的几乎黑色污渍。克劳利忍不住略微皱了皱眉。

"This..." He whimpered. "You're not playing a trick on me, right?"  
“这个……”他哀嚎道。“你不是在捉弄我吧？”

"W...wot?" "什...什么？"

Another wince. Hastur wasn't just bleeding from the mouth, but a fine, thin line of blood was running from his nose and eyes. Crowley pulled his hands back in reflex as something warm dripped on them.  
又一次的痛苦表情。哈斯特不仅从嘴里流血，还有一道细细的血线从他的鼻子和眼睛流淌出来。克劳利本能地把手缩了回去，因为有一些温热的东西滴在了他的手上。

"Shitshit_shit_!" "糟糕糟糕糟糕！"

There were small patches on Hastur's skin that began to look like peeling blisters, and Crowley jumped up with a yelp as he spotted one on his own hand.  
哈斯特尔的皮肤上出现了一些小斑点，开始变得像是剥落的水泡，克劳利看到自己手上也有一个，吓得跳了起来。

It itched and stung like dozens of white-hot needles.  
像数十根白热针一样，痒得刺痛不已。

And a terrible thought crossed his mind.  
他脑海中闪过一个可怕的念头。

Cautiously he moved closer to the knocked-over humidifier, and plucked a hair from his head, letting it fall into the puddle that had formed on the hardwood floor.  
他小心翼翼地靠近被撞倒的加湿器，从头发上拔下一根毛发，让它落入在硬木地板上形成的水坑中。

And watched in terror as the hair burst into a small, ill-smelling flame the moment it hit the water.  
当他们看到头发一触及水就突然燃起了一小团发出难闻气味的火焰，他们吓得目瞪口呆。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

~⧖~

"It looks like a movie set. Like for those stupid cozy mystery shows."  
看起来像电影场景。就像那些愚蠢的温馨悬疑节目一样。

Warlock felt obliged to complain. And it was his good right, wasn't it? His mom had dragged him from one apartment to the next that entire week.  
术士觉得有义务抱怨。这是他的合法权利，不是吗？他妈妈整个星期都把他从一个公寓搬到另一个公寓。

No that wasn't correct. She had dragged him from one apartment to the next only earlier the week. Then it was from one house to the next, culminating in driving out into the middle of who-knows-where.  
不，那不正确。她在上周之前已经把他从一个公寓拖到另一个。然后又是从一个房子搬到另一个，最后开车到了不知道哪里的中间地带。

"Oh, don't be like that, darling," said his mother, making herself comfortable in the bus seat. "You might be surprised, but you were born here." She pointed towards what she thought was the right direction.  
“哦，亲爱的，别这样嘛。”他的母亲说着，舒服地坐在公交车座位上。“也许你会感到惊讶，但你是在这里出生的。”她指着她认为是正确方向的地方。

"Somewhere over, um, there should be the hospital. Very picturesque old mansion. I wonder what became of it."  
在某个地方，嗯，那里应该有一家医院。非常风景如画的古老庄园。不知道它现在怎么样了。

"Prolly the site of a spooky mystery for the local old lady detective."  
可能是当地老太太侦探的一个神秘恐怖场所。

Mrs Dowling smiled. 道林夫人微笑着。

"Or the local bunch of meddling kids."  
或者是一群本地的爱管闲事的孩子们。

Warlock grinned dryly. 术士干笑了一下。

"That'd be cool." 那挺酷的。

"See?" The bus rolled to a halt. "Come then. Let's find someone who knows their way around here."  
"看到了吗？" 公共汽车停了下来。"走吧，我们找个熟悉这里的人问问路。"

"Yeah, 'cause that's gonna be so hard with... two streets and a tree."  
“是啊，因为有两条街和一棵树，这会变得多么困难。”

"Warlock. Really now," Mrs Dowling tutted, and got off the bus.  
术士。真的吗，”道林夫人嘟囔着，然后下了公交车。

"Ah, Miss?" she called to a passenger who had stepped from the bus with them.  
“啊，小姐？”她喊着一个和他们一起从公交车上下来的乘客。

The young woman turned. 那位年轻女子转身了。

"Yes? Can I help you?"  
"什么事？我能帮你吗？"

"Are you from here? We're looking for this address."  
你是本地人吗？我们在找这个地址。

Mrs Dowling produced a crinkled newspaper clipping, making the young woman quirk a brow.  
道林夫人拿出一张皱巴巴的报纸剪报，让年轻女子挑起了眉毛。

"Oh, yes, that's not too far from here."  
哦，是的，离这里不太远。

"Hard to be far from here to begin with," said Warlock, looking around, bored.  
“从这里开始离开真是太难了。”沃洛克无聊地环顾四周说道。

"Charming kid you got there."  
你的孩子真可爱。

Mrs Dowling shrugged. 道林夫人耸了耸肩。

"I've just gone through a..."  
我刚刚经历了一个...

"Divorce. I noticed." 离婚。我注意到了。

"Is it that obvious?... Ah, yeah, the line on my finger..." Mrs Dowling frowned, and hastily waved her hand. "Doesn't matter. Now, where was that house?"  
这么明显吗？...啊，是的，我手指上的线条...道林夫人皱了皱眉，匆忙地挥了挥手。“没关系。现在，那个房子在哪里来着？”

"Down that way, two streets, then to the left, another two, and the right. There should be a sign outside."  
那边走，两条街，然后左转，再走两条，然后右转。外面应该有个标志。

"Naturally. Thank you. Good day." Mrs Dowling turned. "Come, Warlock."  
当然。谢谢。祝您有个愉快的一天。”道林夫人转身说道。“来吧，沃洛克。”

The young woman looked after them till they turned the first corner.  
年轻女子一直照顾他们，直到他们转过第一个拐角。

"What an odd aura that boy had..."  
那个男孩身上有一种奇怪的氛围...

Anathema shook her head, looking rather frustrated at the ground.  
安娜塞玛摇了摇头，看着地面，显得相当沮丧。

"Whatever have you dragged me into now, Agnes?"  
"阿格尼丝，你又把我拖进了什么麻烦里？"

~⧖~

Crowley did not remember much of the last few minutes.  
克劳利对过去几分钟的事情记忆不太清楚。

He had vague recollections of stumbling down the stairs, Hastur's arm draped over his shoulder, the older demon barely conscious.  
他模糊地记得自己摇摇晃晃地走下楼梯，哈斯特的手搭在他肩上，这位年长的恶魔几乎没有意识。

No. Dying. 不行。快死了。

Hastur was dying in the worst way Crowley could imagine.  
哈斯特尔以克劳利能想象到的最糟糕的方式濒临死亡。

Ligur's demise had been quick, and Crowley did feel guilt, even if he'd hardly admit it.  
利古尔的死亡来得很快，克劳利确实感到了内疚，尽管他几乎不愿承认。

But Hastur was dying slowly, being eaten up, _melting_ from the inside out.  
但是哈斯特尔正在慢慢地死去，被吞噬，从内部融化。

Holy Water. 圣水。

It had been a trap.  
这是一个陷阱。

They were both doomed... 他们注定要失败...

Crowley had stumbled through the streets towards the bookshop, maybe only his panicked imagination keeping them alive and from being seen.  
克劳利一路蹒跚走向书店，也许只有他惊慌失措的想象力才能让他们活下来，不被人发现。

Maybe. 可能。

He couldn't tell. 他说不出来。

He could neither tell if the shop had been open, if Aziraphale had shooed customers out or...  
他无法确定店铺是否开着，或者阿齐拉费尔是否赶走了顾客，亦或者...

But now Crowley kneeled on the floor, Hastur bleeding slowly from growing wounds...  
但现在克劳利跪在地板上，哈斯特尔的伤口越来越多地流血...

And Gabriel, Michael and Ligur staring at them in terror.  
而加百列、米迦勒和利古尔则惊恐地盯着他们。

Crowley winced. 克劳利皱了皱眉。

Through the fog in his mind he recalled vaguely expecting Ligur here, but the two Archangels caused an icy lump to drop into his stomach.  
在他脑海中的迷雾中，他模糊地记得曾期待着利古尔出现在这里，但两位大天使让他的胃里掉下了一块冰冷的块状物。

"Lord above preserve us," Gabriel muttered. Had Crowley been in a better state of mind he might have been baffled by how shocked and concerned Gabriel of all beings in creation looked.  
"上帝保佑我们，"加百列嘀咕着。如果克劳利心境更好一些，他可能会对创世之神加百列如此震惊和关切的表情感到困惑。

"What happened? Oh no, no, no, what happened?"  
发生了什么？哦不，不，不，发生了什么？

That was Aziraphale. 那是阿齐拉费尔。

"A trap." Crowley coughed, spitting blood onto the floor. He winced again as something brushed his cheek.  
“一个陷阱。”克劳利咳嗽着，将血吐在地板上。他再次扭曲了一下脸，因为有什么东西刷过他的脸颊。

A feather. 一根羽毛。

Oh... 哦...

Hastur hadn't winched his wings back in, and now they were twitching like he was in his death throes.  
哈斯特尔没有收回他的翅膀，现在它们像他在临死挣扎一样抽搐着。

"Did you drag him through town like that?"  
你就这样把他拖到城里了吗？

Gabriel again. 加布里埃尔又来了。

Crowley only winced, his head swimming.  
克劳利只是略微皱了皱眉，头脑有些晕眩。

"Michael, go see that this didn't cause a ruckus," said Gabriel, while Aziraphale helped Crowley and Hastur onto the sofa.  
"迈克尔，去看看这件事没有引起骚动，"加百利说道，而亚齐拉费尔则帮助克劳利和哈斯特尔坐到了沙发上。

"He's gonna die, he's gonna die, he's gonna die," Crowley wailed, holding his head.  
"他要死了，他要死了，他要死了！" 克劳利嚎叫着，捂着头。

And suddenly Ligur was in his face, eyes white with fear and rage, fingers digging into Crowley's cheeks.  
突然间，利古尔冲到了他的面前，眼睛充满恐惧和愤怒，手指深深地插入克劳利的脸颊。

"What did you do to him?" Ligur said, voice far too calm for Crowley's liking.  
“你对他做了什么？”利古尔说道，声音过于平静，让克劳利感到不悦。

"A trap," Crowley sobbed, all pretence of being cool waiting quietly in the kitchenette. "It was a trap. I didn't... I didn't know... Holy... Holy Water... I..."  
“陷阱。”克劳利哭泣着，所有冷静的伪装都静静地等在小厨房里。“这是个陷阱。我...我不知道...圣...圣水...我...”

Ligur paled, staggered backwards and slumped onto the floor.  
利古尔脸色苍白，向后踉跄，倒在地板上。

"...no..." he stared blankly at Hastur, who had completely lost consciousness by now. "...no..."  
“不……”他茫然地盯着哈斯特，此时哈斯特已完全失去了知觉。“不……”

"And when were you planning on telling me 'bout this, you sanctimonious sheep-biter?" A voice thundered from behind and everyone turned. From the front of the shop came a ginger woman in an off-white pantsuit, whacking her finger accusingly at Gabriel. "Medical emergency, and you don't say a word?" She stopped and bristled. "Oh, why am I even surprised?"  
“你打算什么时候告诉我这件事，你这个伪善的羊咬子？”一道声音从后方响起，所有人都转过头。从店的前方走来一位红发女子，身穿米色西装裤，用指责的手指猛敲着加布里埃尔。她停下来，怒气冲冲地说道：“医疗紧急情况，你竟然一句话都不说？”她停下来，愤怒地说道：“哦，我为什么还会感到惊讶呢？”

Michael stumbled into the shop the next moment.  
下一刻，迈克尔踉跄地走进了店里。

"...Guess who I found," she said lamely, while Raphael looked past Gabriel. Her face softened as she spotted Aziraphale.  
“你猜我找到了谁，”她无奈地说道，同时拉斐尔的目光穿过加百列。当她发现了亚齐拉费尔时，她的脸变得柔和起来。

"Aziraphale, sweetheart, oh, I'm so glad to see you," she said sincerely, stepped over and took his hands, looking him up and down. "Oh, you are looking well, dear. Are you getting enough to eat? Corporations can be so dreadfully complicated to maintain, and..." she turned a glare back to Gabriel, "certain people not getting that into their blockheads aren't helping."  
"亲爱的阿齐拉费尔，哦，见到你真是太高兴了，"她真诚地说着，走过去握住他的手，上下打量着他。"哦，亲爱的，你看起来很好。你吃得够吗？公司管理起来真是麻烦，而且..."她转过头瞪了加百列一眼，"某些人就是不明白这一点，真是让人头疼。"

Aziraphale relaxed a little, though the discomfort in his face shifted a little towards embarrassment. "I'm fine, Raphael, thank you. But..." he nodded at Hastur and Crowley.  
阿齐拉费尔稍微放松了一些，尽管他脸上的不适有点转向尴尬。“我没事，拉斐尔，谢谢你。但是……”他朝哈斯特和克劳利点了点头。

Raphael nodded back, her face becoming stern and determined again.  
拉斐尔点了点头，她的脸色变得严肃而坚定。

"What happened?" she began. "Those look like Holy Water burns..."  
"发生了什么事？"她开始说道。"那些看起来像是圣水烧伤…"

She was already rolling up her sleeves, her jacket flung to the side before Crowley could answer.  
她已经卷起袖子，克劳利还没来得及回答，她的夹克已经扔到一边了。

"Humi... humidi..." he managed, his throat sore. "Hiss hiss water," he went instead.  
“嗯嗯……湿度……”他勉强说道，喉咙有些疼痛。“嘶嘶嘶嘶水。”他改口说道。

"Humidifier?" asked Raphael. "An' Holy Water?"  
"加湿器？" 拉斐尔问道。"还有圣水？"

Crowley nodded. 克劳利点了点头。

Raphael took at scrutinizing look at him and Hastur and miracled up a small bottle.  
拉斐尔审视了他和哈斯图尔，神奇地拿出了一个小瓶子。

"Ligur, hold his head steady," she ordered, nodding at Hastur. "Aziraphale, I need you to prepare two beds. And some tea. Chamomile."  
"利古尔，稳住他的头，"她命令道，向哈斯图尔点了点头。"阿齐拉费尔，我需要你准备两张床。还有一些茶，洋甘菊。"

"Y-yes," Aziraphale stammered, wringing his hands and stumbling to put the kettle on. Ligur meanwhile moved to the side of the sofa, holding Hastur's head with a gentleness that surprised Crowley (as far as he realized it at least).  
“是、是的。”阿齐拉费尔结结巴巴地说着，握着双手慌乱地去烧水。与此同时，利古尔走到沙发旁边，用一种让克劳利感到惊讶的温柔方式扶着哈斯特的头（至少在他意识到的范围内）。

"He's still breathing, good." Raphael pulled the cork from the bottle, the other angels recoiling briefly.  
他还在呼吸，太好了。拉斐尔拔出瓶塞，其他天使稍稍退后了一下。

"For crying out loud, Raphael," said Michael, pressing a hand over her nose and mouth. "What is that?"  
“喂，拉斐尔，真是让人受不了啊。”迈克尔说着，用手捂住了她的鼻子和嘴巴。“那是什么东西？”

"An emergency. I'll explain later." Raphael held the bottle under Hastur's nose, only pulling it back as his breathing steadied.  
紧急情况。等会儿我会解释的。拉斐尔把瓶子放在哈斯图尔的鼻子下面，直到他的呼吸稳定后才把瓶子拿开。

"You," Gabriel began protesting, more baffled than actually angry, "cannot seriously intend on helping _them_. Raphael, they are demons. A Duke of Hell who's to blame for a unsettling long list of miseries. And that," he gestured at Crowley. "He's... he's the one who messed up the Apocalypse. He's a traitor. To Hell, but nevertheless a traitor. He's brought pain and suffering over mankind. He's the one who lost the Antichrist. He's the one who tempted Eve. He's the Serpent!"  
"你," 加百列开始抗议，更多的是困惑而不是真的生气，"你不可能认真打算帮助他们。拉斐尔，他们是恶魔。地狱的公爵，他应该为一长串不幸负责。而那个，"他指着克劳利，"他...他就是搞砸了启示录的那个人。他是个叛徒。对地狱来说是叛徒。他给人类带来了痛苦和苦难。他是那个失去了敌基督的人。他是引诱夏娃的人。他就是那条蛇！"

"And I'm the Doctor." Raphael threw Gabriel an unimpressed glare and turned back to Crowley, "Now look here, laddie."  
“而我就是医生。”拉斐尔不屑地瞪了加百列一眼，然后转身对克劳利说道：“听好了，小子。”

"Ngk," said Crowley as the red-headed Archangel held the bottle under his nose.  
“Ngk，”克劳利说道，当红发大天使将瓶子放在他的鼻子下方。

"Try to breathe in as deep as you can," said Raphael, and Crowley obliged, both of them stolidly ignoring a perplexed and pouting Gabriel.  
“尽量深呼吸，”拉斐尔说道，克劳利依言深吸了一口气，两人都坚定地无视了困惑而撅嘴的加百列。

Crowley would have sworn - demon or not - that he could feel the vapours crawling through his lungs stopping whatever destruction had been under way.  
克劳利会发誓，无论是恶魔与否，他都能感受到蒸汽在他的肺中蔓延，阻止了任何可能正在进行的破坏。

"...That helped," he said. Raphael looked at Gabriel.  
“那有帮助，”他说道。拉斐尔看着加百列。

"Lookit that, he said _Thank You_." She looked back at Crowley, corking the bottle. "Now tell me what happened."  
看那个，他说了谢谢。她回头看着克劳利，塞上瓶塞。“现在告诉我发生了什么事。”

"Do you need the tea to drink or inh-..." Aziraphale called.  
“你是要喝茶还是吸-…” 阿齐拉费尔喊道。

"Both," Raphael called back. "Take Gabe and Michael and see about them beds."🔄  ❓

Both other Archangels opened their mouths to protest, but a sharp glare and jutted chin from Raphael shut up Michael, and Michael's hand on Gabriel's shoulder did the same for exactly that one.  
其他两位大天使都想要开口抗议，但拉斐尔的锐利目光和昂起的下巴让迈克尔闭上了嘴，而迈克尔的手放在加百列的肩膀上也让他保持了沉默。

"We shall talk about this back home," said Gabriel as Michael pulled him along.  
“回到家再谈吧。”迈克尔拉着加百列说道。

"Now then..." said Raphael, looking at Crowley expectantly. "Wot 'appened?"  
“那么……” 拉斐尔说着，期待地看着克劳利。“发生了什么事？”

Crowley took a moment to collect himself, rubbing his chest.  
克劳利花了一会儿时间来收拾自己，揉了揉胸口。

"They had a job 'bout draggin' some bloke t' Hell," Ligur said, eyes fixed on Hastur still.  
"他们有个任务是把一个家伙拖到地狱去，"利古尔说着，目光仍然盯着哈斯特尔。

Crowley nodded. 克劳利点了点头。

"Yeah, that. Hastur got some intel and things and we went there and... It was a trap. Guess the guy was all paranoid and..." he fell silent as he caught Ligur's glare.  
“是的，就是那个。哈斯特尔得到了一些情报，我们就去了那里，结果...那是个陷阱。看来那家伙非常多疑，”他停下来，因为他注意到利古尔的怒视。

"Why yer so far better off than him?" asked Ligur, voice like ice.  
"你为什么比他好得多呢？"利格尔问道，声音冷若冰霜。

"I had a look 'round the house. I didn't... he sat with those things much longer..."  
我在房子里转了一圈。我没有...他和那些东西坐得更久...

"The beds would be ready then."  
床会准备好的。

Crowley had never been so thankful for Aziraphale's horrible timing before.  
克劳利以前从未如此感激阿齐拉费尔糟糕的时机。

Scratching his arm Crowley got up, moving to help carry the older demon to the bedroom upstairs.  
克劳利挠了挠胳膊，站起身来，走过去帮忙抬那个年长的恶魔上楼到卧室。

"Don't you dare touch him." Ligur snarled, teeth bared and eyes gleaming in an angry reddish black.  
“你敢碰他试试看。”利格尔咆哮着，露出牙齿，愤怒的红黑色眼睛闪烁着光芒。

Crowley was wise enough to take a step back and let the others handle this.  
克劳利足够明智，退后一步，让其他人处理这个问题。

Then again, he had his hands full with the pang of guilt that had just come back to its spot at the pool with a cocktail and an unabridged copy of Les Mis.  
然而，他又被内疚的痛苦所困扰，它刚刚带着一杯鸡尾酒和一本完整版的《悲惨世界》回到了泳池边。

Appropriate. 合适的。

He slunk after the group heading up the stairs, hands buried as deep in his pockets as his legwear allowed, head hung low.  
他悄悄地跟在上楼的人群后面，双手深深地插在口袋里，低着头。

"Now, every not-demon: Out." Raphael ordered once Hastur was on the bed, and earned a few confused looks for it. And one disbelieving one from Ligur.  
“现在，所有非恶魔的人都出去。”拉斐尔一边把哈斯特放到床上，一边下令，这让一些人感到困惑。而利古尔则露出了不可置信的表情。

Her face softened. 她的脸变得柔和了。

"I'm sorry, dear, but yer'n angel now. In this state yer aura might kill'im."  
亲爱的，很抱歉，但你现在是个天使了。在这种状态下，你的光环可能会伤害到他。

The sound Ligur made drove several arrows through Crowley's heart. And Gabriel's too, but only Aziraphale noticed that.  
利古尔发出的声音穿透了克劳利的心脏，射入了几支箭。加百利也受到了影响，但只有阿齐拉费尔注意到了这一点。

And was intrigued. 然后被吸引了。

"We... will be downstairs then," Aziraphale thus said, nudging the other angels out. "If you need anything..."  
"我们...那时会在楼下，"亚齐拉费尔这样说着，轻推其他天使出去。“如果你需要什么...”

"Hot water," said Raphael, putting her bag down on a chair.  
拉斐尔把她的包放在椅子上说道：“热水。”

"Certainly," said Aziraphale, and closed the door.  
“当然，”亚齐拉费尔说着，然后关上了门。

Inside the room Raphael shook her head and looked at Crowley.  
在房间里，拉斐尔摇了摇头，看着克劳利。

And then threw him a pair of purple rubber gloves.  
然后向他扔了一双紫色的橡胶手套。

"You'll need'em. Help me with his clothes, laddie."  
你会需要它们的。帮我处理他的衣服，小伙子。

"What?" 什么？

"Them two of you can be lucky you're wearing pretty well-covering clothes. Anything flimsy..."  
你们两个要庆幸自己穿着遮得住的衣服。要是穿得太薄的话...

Crowley, in the best tradition of stupid instinctual decisions, sniffed his sleeve, immediately howling in pain and holding his nose.  
克劳利，按照最佳的愚蠢本能决定的传统，嗅了嗅他的袖子，立刻痛得大声嚎叫，并捂住鼻子。

"Exactly," said Raphael, fiddling with Hastur's coat. "Undress an' help me with his wings." That said, she looked at the miserable state of the demon's left wing. "Know what happened there?"  
"没错，"拉斐尔说着，玩弄着哈斯图尔的外套。"脱掉衣服，帮我处理他的翅膀。"说完，她看着那只可怜的恶魔左翅膀。"知道那里发生了什么吗？"

"Hell," said Crowley, squirming out of his clothes while trying to make as little contact with them as possible.  
“地狱。”克劳利说着，一边尽量避免与衣物接触，一边蠕动着脱下它们。

"Hey, will he... y'know..." Crowley began, tossing his clothes to the side and scratching the reddish patches on his neck.  
“嘿，他会……你懂的……”克劳利开始说道，一边把衣服扔到一边，一边挠着脖子上的红斑。

Raphael gave him a deeply hurt and insulted look.  
拉斐尔给了他一个深深受伤和受侮辱的表情。

"Gonna tell you something. _You_ certainly won't be fine if you dun stop scratching yerself."  
要告诉你一件事。如果你不停止抓自己，你肯定会不舒服的。

Crowley frowned softly, but fought off the urge to scratch himself bloody.  
克劳利轻轻皱了皱眉，但他抑制住了想要抓破自己的冲动。

"Close the curtains before y'get out of yer panties."  
在你脱掉内裤之前拉上窗帘。

"What?" Crowley didn't know his voice could get that high in this form, not unintentionally at least.  
“什么？”克劳利不知道自己在这个形态下的声音居然能够如此高亢，至少不是无意识地。

"Y'wanna lose yer groin and whatever effort y'made to some Holy Water soaked shorts? Be my guest, but dun come complaining." Raphael smiled cockily.  
“你想要失去你的下体和你为之付出的努力，换上一条浸泡过圣水的短裤吗？随你便，但别来抱怨。”拉斐尔得意地笑了笑。

"You're as horrible as I remember you," muttered Crowley, pulling the curtains close and dropping his last set of garments before stalking around the bed.  
"你还是和我记忆中一样可怕，" 克劳利嘟囔着，拉上窗帘，脱下最后一套衣服，然后在床边来回踱步。

"And yet people wonder where you got it from." Raphael's smile softened, and Crowley smiled back sincerely.  
“然而人们还在猜想你是从哪里得到的。”拉斐尔的微笑变得温和，克劳利真诚地回以微笑。

"I missed you," he said, carefully easing the wing through the split seams in Hastur's clothes.  
“我想你了。”他说着，小心地将翅膀穿过哈斯特尔衣服的裂缝。

"I missed you too. You've come a long way from a fledgling angel who couldn't get their shell off their foot."  
"我也很想你。你已经走了很长的路，从一个无法脱掉脚上壳的初生天使变成了现在的样子。"

"And naturally you go and embarrass me. Bring out the polaroids, why don't you?" Crowley rolled his eyes. Not that he really meant it.  
“当然你要出来让我难堪。拿出那些拍立得照片吧，你为什么不拿出来呢？”克劳利翻了个白眼。虽然他并不是真心这么想。

"Will he be okay?" he asked again, his voice much more of a whisper now.  
他再次问道：“他会没事吗？”他的声音现在更像是低语。

"He's breathing, but..." 他还在呼吸，但是...

With a heavy sigh Raphael leaned back. "I'm more worried about his wing. That mist's eating into it pretty nastily."  
拉斐尔重重地叹了口气，向后靠了靠。“我更担心他的翅膀。那股雾气正在恶劣地侵蚀着它。”

Crowley's eyes widened behind his glasses.  
克劳利戴着眼镜，眼睛瞪大了。

"_Is_?" 是吗？

Raphael nodded, carefully pushing aside a bushel of twisted, dull feathers.  
拉斐尔点了点头，小心地推开一捆扭曲、暗淡的羽毛。

The patch below was a dreadful sight and will thus be left undescribed.  
下面的补丁是一个可怕的景象，因此将不予描述。

"Can't you do something?" asked Crowley the moment he felt less nauseous. "I mean... you are you."  
“你难道不能做点什么吗？”克劳利感觉不那么恶心的瞬间问道。“我的意思是...你就是你。”

Raphael smiled dryly. 拉斐尔干笑了一下。

"Has he been acting oddly lately?" she asked.  
她问道：“他最近表现得怪怪的吗？”

Crowley hesitated. 克劳利犹豫了一下。

"By whose standards?" 按照谁的标准？

"His essence is very low," Raphael stated matter-of-factly. "He can be happy he survived whatever Hell put him through."  
"他的本质很低劣，" 拉斐尔毫不客气地说道。"他能庆幸自己幸存下来，无论地狱曾经对他施加了什么样的折磨。"

"... Is that why Ligur's aura could kill him?"  
“这就是为什么利古尔的气场会杀死他吗？”

Raphael nodded. 拉斐尔点了点头。

"Did y'ever wonder why the Boss made me with an aura like mine? So dreadfully unangelic as Sandalphon loves to put it? This' why."  
你有没有想过为什么老板让我拥有像我这样的光环？像桑达尔芬所说的那样，那么可怕地不像天使？这就是原因。

"I..." Crowley began, yet unable to admit that he was worried for the other demon.  
“我……” 克劳利开始说，然而他无法承认自己对另一个恶魔感到担忧。

Hastur had, after all, tried to kill him twice - in over 6000 years, but still -, discorporated him dozens of times, and had been present at his punishments in Hell about as often.  
毕竟，哈斯特尔曾两次试图杀死他——在6000多年的时间里，但仍然如此——无数次将他解体，还经常亲眼目睹他在地狱受罚。

And yet... 然而...

With what Ligur had said a lot of things appeared in a new light.  
根据Ligur所说的，许多事情都呈现出新的光芒。

Looking back there had always been something to the discorporations Hastur had managed that made them less severe than what Crowley might have suffered at the hands of mortals or even angels otherwise, and where Hastur didn't succeed often enough served as a needed kick to Crowley's behind, didn't it?  
回顾过去，哈斯特尔所进行的解体行为总是比克劳利在凡人或甚至天使手中所受的苦难要轻微，而哈斯特尔未能成功的时候，往往成为了对克劳利的一记必要的警醒，不是吗？

And hadn't Hastur always been injured when he came by to see Crowley suffer?  
而且哈斯特尔每次来看克劳利受苦时，总是受伤了吗？

Crowley winced, and traced a hand over the older demon's good wing.  
克劳利皱了皱眉，用手抚摸着那只年长恶魔的好翅膀。

"What does that mean for him?"  
那对他意味着什么？

Raphael folded her hands.  
拉斐尔双手交叉。

"I could amputate the wing..."  
我可以截肢这只翅膀...

"He'll kill you," said Crowley, without a hint of sarcasm. "Or never forgive you. Dunno which's worse."  
克劳利毫不带讽刺地说道：“他会杀了你，或者永远不会原谅你。不知道哪个更糟。”

In response Raphael just nodded curtly, got up and left the room.  
对此，拉斐尔只是简短地点了点头，站起身离开了房间。

Crowley sat up curiously. As rattled as he was, he had enough self-awareness left to know he couldn't waltz around the shop naked.  
克劳利好奇地坐了起来。虽然他心烦意乱，但他还有足够的自我意识知道自己不能赤身裸体地在店里闲逛。

So he waited. 于是他等待着。

"Alright. Next o' kin greenlit it, we're going in."  
"好的，亲属已经批准了，我们要进去了。"

Crowley nearly tumbled off the bed in surprise as Raphael stormed back in, smacking a water bottle onto the table and snapping gloves into place.  
克劳利吃惊得差点从床上摔下来，拉斐尔气势汹汹地回到房间，将一个水瓶砰地放在桌子上，然后戴上手套。

"See about getting'im comf'table, laddie." Raphael pulled an array of jars and vials, a mortar and a nastily large syringe from her bag. Crowley winced.  
"看看能不能让他舒服点，小伙子。"拉斐尔从她的包里拿出一排瓶瓶罐罐、一个研钵和一个相当大的注射器。克劳利皱了皱眉。

"An' make sure he can buck without twisting anything. This gonna hurt."  
确保他能够扭动身体而不受伤。这会很疼的。

Crowley watched in fascinated horror as the Archangel mixed together some rusty red liquid, gazing at it inside the syringe against the light.  
克劳利惊恐地看着大天使将一些生锈的红色液体混合在一起，透过光线注射器仔细地观察着。

"What yer waiting for?" Raphael looked disappointed.  
“你在等什么？”拉斐尔看起来很失望。

Once more Crowley winced, and rather hurriedly moved Hastur around on the bed.  
克劳利再次皱了皱眉，匆忙地将哈斯特尔在床上移动了一下。

"I need you to keep him from winching in his wings, Crowley."  
克劳利，我需要你阻止他收起他的翅膀。

"What?" 什么？

"See that bottle?" Raphael pointed a scalpel blade at the table. "Holy Water, freshly blessed, heavily diluted. Much more than what soaked into yer clothes an' his wing. An' I need to wash that shite out."  
“看见那个瓶子了吗？”拉斐尔用手术刀的刀片指向桌子。“圣水，新鲜祝福过的，稀释得很厉害。比你的衣服和他的翅膀上渗透的要多得多。我得把那些狗屎洗掉。”

Crowley felt the blood drain from his face.  
克劳利感到脸上的血液离开了。

"You... you're not going to inject him with... Raph, that's gonna... that..."  
你...你不会给他注射...Raph，那会...那...

"It might. First time I do something like this on a demon..."  
可能会。我第一次在一个恶魔身上做这样的事情...

Raphael cut open several spots on the wing, discoloured blood and something else seeping out.  
拉斐尔在翅膀上切开了几个地方，有着变色的血液和其他东西渗出来。

For a moment Crowley and Raphael had to turn away coughing. Then the Archangel took a brief, determined breath... and plunged the needle into a gently pulsing swelling just under one of the joints.  
克劳利和拉斐尔不禁咳嗽了一阵。然后大天使深吸了一口气，下定决心...然后将针头插入一个轻轻脉动的肿胀部位，正好在一个关节下方。

Outside the room Aziraphale was glad Michael had helped with a little miracle to not let any sound get out of the building.  
在房间外，亚齐拉费尔很高兴迈克尔帮忙做了一个小奇迹，不让任何声音透出建筑物。

Even Gabriel whimpered in sympathy.  
甚至加百利也同情地呜咽了起来。

"That was... loud..." said Michael, if only to say something to sooth her nerves.  
迈克尔说道：“那声音...太大了...”，只是为了安抚她的紧张情绪而说。

"I had hoped ne'er to hear that kinda scream again," murmured Ligur, staringly shakily at the ceiling, while Michael held his hand.  
“我本以为再也不会听到那种尖叫声了。”利古尔低声说道，颤抖地盯着天花板，而迈克尔则握着他的手。

Gabriel shifted, and Aziraphale would have sworn the Archangel had mouthed 'So had I.'  
加百列移动了一下，阿齐拉费尔几乎可以发誓看到大天使嘴里嘟囔着“我也是”。

The silence that followed came so suddenly that its presence in Aziraphale's shop might have surprised itself.  
紧接着而来的寂静如此突然，以至于它在亚齐拉费尔的书店里的存在可能会让它自己感到惊讶。

"He... will be alright. I'm certain of it," said Aziraphale, worrying his cuffs.  
“他……会没事的。我对此非常有把握。”亚齐拉费尔担心地整理着袖口说道。

"And if not, it will simply be one demon less to worry about."  
如果不是这样的话，那就少了一个魔鬼需要担心了。

Everyone turned and stared at Gabriel. Michael with a bemused brow quirked, Ligur with wrath in his eyes and Aziraphale with confusion.  
所有人都转过头盯着加百利。迈克尔皱着眉头带着一丝困惑，利古尔眼中充满愤怒，而阿齐拉费尔则一脸困惑。

He had been on the receiving end of Gabriel's pep talks about Heaven, Hell and 'Doing Good' often enough to know the Archangel's tone when he rejoiced in any potential setback and defeat Hell suffered.  
他曾多次听到加百列关于天堂、地狱和“行善”的鼓励，以至于他能够准确地判断出大天使在任何潜在挫折和地狱的失败面前所表现出的欣喜口吻。

And this was not it.  
这还不是全部。

Gabriel's voice rung hollow and mechanic, a bit like a broken record.  
加布里埃尔的声音空洞而机械，有点像一张坏掉的唱片。

Aziraphale took a deep breath, rose and stepped over, placing his hands on Gabriel's arm.  
亚齐拉费尔深吸一口气，站起身来，迈步走过去，把双手放在加百列的胳膊上。

"You... should perhaps... go for a walk," said Aziraphale, fixing Gabriel with a stare usually reserved for Crowley whenever the demon had some trouble understanding that his latest diabolical scheme was a most ridiculous hassle and bound to bite him in the buttocks before he'd even gone through with it.  
“你...或许应该...出去散散步。”亚齐拉费尔说着，用一种通常只对克劳利保留的目光盯着加百列，每当这个恶魔对于自己最新的邪恶计划无法理解，觉得这个荒谬的麻烦必定会在他付诸实施之前就让他吃苦头时，亚齐拉费尔都会用这种目光看着他。

Gabriel blinked. 加布里埃尔眨了眨眼睛。

"...A walk. Yes. Brilliant idea," he murmured.  
“散散步。是的。太棒了，”他低声说道。

"Gabriel," Michael began, "I think Aziraphale... oh."  
"Gabriel," Michael开始说道，"我觉得Aziraphale...哦。"

Michael looked a little taken aback that Gabriel -who was already halfway out the shop but was now waiting for what was coming- had agreed to the suggestion so easily.  
迈克尔有些吃惊，加百利已经走出了店门，但此刻却停下来等待着即将发生的事情，他竟然如此轻易地同意了这个建议。

"That's a new one," said Michael. Next to her, Ligur frowned, pulling his hand from her caress.  
"这还真是新鲜事儿，"迈克尔说道。在她旁边，利古尔皱起了眉头，从她的抚摸中抽回了手。

"Dun be like that. Y'agree with him, right?"  
别这样。你同意他的观点，对吧？

Michael drew a long, sharp breath.  
迈克尔深吸了一口长长的气。

"Raphael is good, but judging by that sound this is beyond even her abilities."  
拉斐尔很厉害，但从那个声音来看，这已经超出了她的能力范围。

Ligur didn't even look at Michael as he rose after that, stalking towards the door.  
利古尔甚至没有看迈克尔一眼，他站起身来，朝门口走去。

Only to be stopped by Aziraphale.  
只被阿齐拉费尔拦住。

"I don't think it would be wise for you to leave," he said, calmly, before looking at the two Archangels. "You two however... I reckon you have said and done what you came here for, haven't you?" His tone was maybe a little too sweet.  
他平静地说：“我认为你离开可能不明智。”然后他看向两位大天使。“不过，你们两个……我猜你们已经说了你们来这里的目的，是吗？”他的语气可能有点过于甜蜜。

Another, much more ordinary moment of silence followed, broken only by the sounds from the street rushing in again as the little miracle lifted.  
又一个普通得多的沉默时刻随之而来，只有街上的声音再次涌入，随着那个小奇迹的升起而打破。

"We have," said Gabriel, in the same too sweet tone. "Come, Michael. I am certain we can leave everything to the capable hands of Raphael and our field agents." He grabbed Michael by the upper arm and pulled her upright. Judging by Michael's displeased and surprised glare, Gabriel was gripping a little harder than necessary, and certainly harder than Michael might have deemed him capable of.  
“我们有，”加百列以同样过于甜蜜的语调说道。“来吧，迈克尔。我相信我们可以把一切交给拉斐尔和我们的外勤人员处理。”他抓住迈克尔的上臂，把她拉直。从迈克尔不悦和惊讶的眼神来看，加百列的握力似乎有点过分，肯定超出了迈克尔认为他能够做到的程度。

"Farewell," said Gabriel before Michael could get a word in, and with the ring of a bell they were gone.  
“再见。”加百列在迈克尔来得及开口之前说道，随着一声铃响，他们消失了。

Aziraphale sighed, exhausted, his shoulders slumping.  
亚齐拉费尔叹了口气，筋疲力尽，双肩耷拉着。

"I'm terribly sorry," he said, leading Ligur back to the couch. "I'm certain Raphael is doing what she can. And you know how stubborn she can be."  
“非常抱歉。”他说着，把利古尔领回到沙发上。“我相信拉斐尔正在尽力。而且你知道她有多么固执。”

"Don't try, Aziraphale," Ligur began, sitting down and worrying his cuffs like Aziraphale had done before. "Michael's right, ain't she? There's hardly hope." He rested his head in his hands. "'Tis nothing but another rotten joke, an' you know it."  
"别试了，阿齐拉费尔，"利古尔开始说道，坐下来像阿齐拉费尔之前那样担心地摆弄着袖口。"迈克尔说得对，不是吗？几乎没有希望了。"他将头埋在双手中。"这只不过是又一个糟糕的玩笑，你明白的。"

Aziraphale's hand hovered over the other's back, before he gently lowered it, rubbing soothingly.  
亚齐拉费尔的手在对方的背上悬停了一下，然后他轻轻放下，温柔地揉捏着。

"We should try and wait. It won't do if you leave now to go for a walk with uncertainty."  
我们应该试着等一等。如果你现在离开去散步，心里没底，那可不行。

Ligur looked up. 利古尔抬起头。

"Man, it really shows you fucked Wilde."  
哥们，这真是让你操莫里斯·怀尔德的事情给你上了一课。

Aziraphale bristled. 亚齐拉费尔愤怒地竖起了毛。

"Ah! I am trying to help here."  
啊！我在这里尽力帮忙。

Ligur smiled a wry smile.  
利古尔苦笑了一下。

"You are. It's just..." 你是。只是...

Aziraphale gently took his hand.  
亚齐拉费尔轻轻握住了他的手。

"I understand. Believe me, I understand."  
我明白。相信我，我明白。

Ligur looked at him. And nodded.  
利古尔看着他，点了点头。

"Now we wait?" 现在我们等吗？

"Now we wait." 现在我们等待。

~⧖~

"Ah, you must be Miss Device then," Miss Mag greeted Anathema at the gate.  
“啊，你一定就是设备小姐了。”玛格小姐在门口向阿纳西玛打招呼。

"Yes. You're Miss Bolton?"  
是的。你是Bolton小姐吗？

"Oh, please call me Miss Mag. I'm terribly sorry you got called here. I understood that book..."🔄  ❓

Anathema waved her off. Anathema挥了挥手示意她离开。

"Believe me. If Agnes explicitly wrote not to bother me she did that for the sole purpose to ensure I get bothered."  
相信我。如果Agnes明确写道不要打扰我，那她这样做的唯一目的就是确保我被打扰。

"Ohh? Huh. Cheeky that. Ah, won't you come in then?"  
哦？嗯。真是个调皮的家伙。啊，那你就进来吧。

"Gladly," said Anathema as they walked up the path. "I hadn't expected to come back to Tadfield so soon. Or... ever, for that matter."  
“很高兴，”Anathema说着，他们沿着小路走上去。“我没想到会这么快就回到Tadfield。或者说...永远都不会回来。”

"Ah, Adam told me you moved away from here only a while ago." Miss Mag ducked into the kitchen. "Tea?"  
“啊，亚当告诉我你不久前搬离了这里。”玛格小姐躲进了厨房。“来杯茶吗？”

"Yes, thank you. And yes."  
是的，谢谢。是的。

"Jasmine Cottage, correct? How peculiar."  
茉莉小屋，对吗？多么奇怪。

Anathema quirked a brow. 安娜塞玛挑了挑眉毛。

"How so?" 怎么回事？

"Oh, nothing special, dearie. I’ve just recently become acquainted with the most intriguing fellow that moved into there just a couple of days ago. Mr Nicholas."  
哦，没什么特别的，亲爱的。我最近刚认识了一个非常有趣的家伙，他就在那里住了几天。尼古拉斯先生。

"Ah?" "啊？"

"He's an author, you know. Came here for inspiration."  
他是个作家，你知道的。来这里寻找灵感的。

The kettle whistled and Miss Mag moved to get everything ready. Anathema had long since sat down at the kitchen table.  
水壶响了，玛格小姐赶紧准备好一切。安娜塞玛早就坐在厨房的桌子旁边了。

"Is that so?" she asked.  
"是这样吗？"她问道。

"Yes. And, I know it's not all fair to say so, but he's quite a source of frustration for the children."  
是的。而且，我知道这样说可能不太公平，但他对孩子们来说确实是个令人沮丧的源泉。

Miss Mag put the tray down, pouring each of them a cup. In lack of a proper tea set this had her end up with a pale pink one with roses, while Anathema found herself with a mug that proclaimed _'The road to Hell is badly signposted'_.  
麦格小姐把托盘放下，给每个人倒了一杯。由于没有合适的茶具，她拿了一个粉色的带玫瑰花的杯子，而阿纳西玛则拿了一个杯子上写着“通往地狱的路标不清”的马克杯。

"How come?" 怎么回事？

"Oh, he's very elusive, that one. The children try and try to meet him but he seems to be always where they aren't, and it'd seem they usually are where he just left."  
哦，那个人真是难以捉摸。孩子们一直努力想见到他，但他似乎总是在他们不在的地方，而他们似乎通常都在他刚离开的地方。

Anathema nodded curtly. It wouldn't do to tell a complete stranger - no matter that Agnes had dragged the poor woman into whatever this was going to be - about the odd undercurrent that seeped through Tadfield.  
阿纳塞玛干脆地点了点头。告诉一个完全陌生的人是不合适的——无论阿格尼丝把这个可怜的女人拖进了这个即将发生的事情中——关于塔德菲尔德中那奇怪的潜流，最好还是不要说。

It seemed... familiar. But Anathema couldn't tell if in a good or bad way.  
这感觉...有点熟悉。但是Anathema无法确定是好还是坏的感觉。

It did have her hair stand on end though.  
这确实让她毛骨悚然。

"Now," said Miss Mag, putting her cup down and taking the book from the tray. "Enough of that, that's not what you are here for."  
“现在，”玛格小姐放下杯子，从托盘上拿起书说道。“别再说那些了，你来这里不是为了那个。”

She smiled and handed Anathema the book.  
她微笑着把书递给了Anathema。

With a sigh Anathema put her own mug down, took first the book, then a deep breath.  
安娜塞玛叹了口气，放下自己的杯子，先拿起书，然后深吸了一口气。

And opened the book at random.  
随意翻开书页。

_Well met, Anathema  你好，Anathema_

Anathema frowned, but read on  
阿纳塞玛皱了皱眉，但继续阅读

_Fear ye not the King in the house of words, nor his adornment. For it is formidable, but it is not for you, not in pleasance nor in danger  
不要畏惧言辞之王，也不要畏惧他的华丽装饰。因为它虽然令人敬畏，但它并不属于你，无论是在愉悦还是危险之中。_

With a drawn-out sigh Anathema closed the book.  
安娜塞玛长长地叹了口气，合上了书。

"Cryptic, isn't it?" said Miss Mag.  
“这个有点神秘，不是吗？”玛格小姐说道。

"Agnes has always been like that," sighed Anathema.  
安娜塔玛叹了口气：“阿格尼丝一直都是这样的。”

Anathema shook her head, and leafed through the book again.  
阿纳塞玛摇了摇头，又翻了翻书。

"I can't believe it," she murmured.  
"我简直不敢相信，"她低声说道。

"What is?" 什么是？

"That Agnes pulled a complete stranger into this. I mean, it is absolutely her style, but... Doesn't bear thinking about the reason..."  
"Agnes竟然把一个完全陌生的人牵扯进来。我是说，这绝对是她的风格，但是...想到原因真是让人不寒而栗..."

Anathema shuddered a little and read on the page she was on.  
安娜塞玛微微颤抖着，继续阅读她所在的页面。

"..._beware the Angel with the Deville's face, for he_..." Her brows furrowed. "Huh."  
"...小心那个长着恶魔面孔的天使，因为他..." 她皱起了眉头。"嗯。"

"Is something amiss? Besides Agnes pulling me into this."  
有什么不对劲吗？除了Agnes拉着我参与其中。

"I'm not... sure..." Determined Anathema shut the book again. "Just... does anyone else know that you received the book?"  
“我不太确定……”下定决心的厄运再次合上书。“只是……还有其他人知道你收到这本书吗？”

"Aside the children, you mean? Admittedly, yes." A hint of guilt swept over Miss Mag's face. "I mean, I didn't know you existed, so I contacted an expert in London. In fact, I'll be visiting him about the book just tomorrow."  
除了孩子们，你是指他们吗？诚然，是的。”玛格小姐的脸上掠过一丝愧疚。“我的意思是，我不知道你的存在，所以我联系了伦敦的一位专家。事实上，明天我将去拜访他，就是关于这本书的事情。”

Anathema frowned once more. If there was something that wasn't a good idea with Agnes then it was getting more strangers involved.  
阿纳塞玛再次皱起了眉头。如果有什么对阿格尼丝来说不是个好主意的话，那就是让更多陌生人参与进来。

She rubbed her temples. 她揉了揉太阳穴。

"You don't look so well," said Miss Mag.  
"你看起来不太好," Mag 小姐说道。

"I'm fine, don't worry." Anathema told Miss Mag what she thought.  
"我很好，别担心。" Anathema 告诉 Miss Mag 她的想法。

"Do you reckon I should call the meeting off? You know better what the right course is here." said Miss Mag, looking a little disappointed.  
“你觉得我应该取消会议吗？你更清楚这里应该采取什么正确的做法。” 麦格小姐说着，看起来有些失望。

"Yes. I doubt there is any 'expert' who could tell you any-" Anathema paused. "Who is this expert anyway?"  
"是的。我怀疑有谁能告诉你任何-" 安娜塞玛停顿了一下。 "这个专家到底是谁？"

"Oh," Miss Mag smiled, "judging by the phone call we had he's a bit an odd one, but charming. A.Z. Fell's his name."  
“哦，”玛格小姐微笑着说道，“根据我们的电话交谈，他有点古怪，但很有魅力。他叫A.Z.费尔。”

Anathema's face went the kind of blank that has one know she was inwardly cursing someone.  
安娜塞玛的脸变得一片茫然，让人知道她内心正在诅咒某人。

Quite probably Agnes. 很有可能是Agnes。

"Oh. Yes," said Anathema. "That... maybe you should see this expert after all. And maybe I should accompany you to London."  
“哦，是的。”安娜塞玛说道，“也许你真的应该去找这位专家。也许我应该陪你去伦敦。”

~⧖~

"And now?" asked Crowley, watching Raphael put away her tools.  
“现在呢？”克劳利问道，看着拉斐尔收起她的工具。

Hastur was out cold on the bed, his chest rising and falling in shuddering, but otherwise steady breaths.  
哈斯特躺在床上一动不动，胸口起伏着，呼吸虽然有些颤抖，但却稳定。

"We wait," said Raphael, and sat back down, absentmindedly miracling some of the worst stains off the bed and her clothes.  
"我们等待," Raphael 说着，然后重新坐下，心不在焉地用奇迹般地将床上和她的衣服上最严重的污渍清除掉。

"He's so cold..." 他好冷...

Crowley had been holding the other demon still during the entire ordeal, and was now tracing his hand down Hastur's arm.  
克劳利在整个折磨过程中一直抓住另一个恶魔，现在正沿着哈斯图尔的手臂轻轻抚摸。

"Should he be that cold? I mean, he's sorta amphibian, but should he be that cold?"  
他应该这么冷吗？我是说，他有点像两栖动物，但他应该这么冷吗？

Raphael smiled in sympathy.  
拉斐尔同情地微笑着。

"He should be fine. This took a lot out of him."  
他应该没事。这让他很吃力。

"Can imagine." Crowley nodded mournfully, and ultimately rose, helping himself to one of Aziraphale's old nightshirts.  
"可以想象。" 克劳利沉痛地点了点头，最终站起身来，拿起了阿齐拉费尔的一件旧睡衣。

To Crowley's knowledge the angel had only bought them back in the day because what respectable gentleman would not own proper sleeping attire? Oddly enough they smelled faintly of demon, something Crowley had no explanation for.  
据克劳利所知，天使当初只是买了它们，因为哪个体面的绅士不会拥有合适的睡衣呢？奇怪的是，它们散发着一丝恶魔的气息，这是克劳利无法解释的。

"Y'seem really worried, Crowley."  
克劳利，你看起来真的很担心。

"... I... no... I'd..." Crowley's shoulders slumped. "Yes. Don't you dare tell anyone."  
“我...不...我会...” 克劳利的肩膀耷拉下来。“是的。你敢告诉任何人，小心点。”

Raphael smiled cockily. 拉斐尔得意地笑了笑。

"It's just," Crowley began anew. "These past few... hours I... A lot has changed. I think... I think he's not as much of an arse as I always thou- OW!"  
“只是，”克劳利重新开始说道。“这些过去的几个……小时，我……发生了很多变化。我觉得……我觉得他并不像我一直以为的那样讨厌——哎呀！”

Either it was a subconscious reflex, or Hastur was awake already, in any case, he had smacked Crowley in the face with his good wing.  
不管是下意识的反射还是哈斯特尔已经醒来了，总之，他用他的好翅膀狠狠地打了克劳利的脸。

Raphael leaned to the side, prodding the older demon's nose.  
拉斐尔向一侧倾斜，戳了戳年长的恶魔的鼻子。

"Y'awake?" 你醒了吗？

It took a moment, but Hastur stirred.  
哈斯特尔稍稍动了一下。

"Fuck me sideways, it's Raphael," he slurred, staring at the Archangel blearily. "How long's it been? A century or somethin'?"  
"我靠，是拉斐尔啊，"他含糊不清地说着，朦胧地盯着大天使。"我们多久没见了？一百年还是什么的？"

Raphael nodded. 拉斐尔点了点头。

"Sounds about right. You are still as stubborn and hard to knock down as I remember you. Did you find a new ferryman?"  
听起来差不多。你还是像我记得的那样固执而难以击倒。你找到新的渡船人了吗？

Hastur stirred a little more and scratched his neck.  
哈斯特尔稍微动了一下，挠了挠脖子。

"Yeah, over'n Birmingham. Odd story, that one..."  
"是的，在伯明翰。那个故事真是奇怪啊..."

With a groan he sank back onto the pillows.  
他发出一声呻吟，倒在枕头上。

"You know each other?" said Crowley.  
"你们认识吗？" 克劳利问道。

"Obviously..." Hastur grumbled. "What? Y'think yer the only one wot ever came 'cross angels on the job?"  
“显然……”哈斯特嘟囔着说。“什么？你以为你是唯一一个在工作中遇到天使的人？”

"No... just..." 不...只是...

"Fuck it's cold..." Hastur shivered, trying to move deeper under the blanket. Raphael gave Crowley a curt nod.  
"靠，好冷啊..." 哈斯特颤抖着，试图把自己藏得更深一些在毯子下面。拉斐尔对克劳利点了点头。

"The blanket, yes," confirmed Crowley, and stalked over to get one from the wardrobe.  
"毯子，没错，"克劳利确认道，然后走到衣柜拿了一条。

"Where'm I?" Hastur squirmed a bit as Crowley placed the thick feather duvet over him.  
“我在哪儿？”哈斯特在克劳利把厚厚的羽绒被子盖在他身上时有些扭动了一下。

"The book shop," Crowley said. And Hastur snarled darkly.  
“书店，”克劳利说道。哈斯特尔阴沉地咆哮着。

"Wot's that about?" Raphael cocked her head at the sound.  
“这是怎么回事？”拉斐尔听到声音后歪了一下头。

Hastur squinted at her, obviously having trouble focussing.  
哈斯特尔皱起眉头看着她，显然很难集中注意力。

"Nuffin'." "什么都没有。"

"Suit yerself." With a shrug Raphael rose, and produced what looked like a pocket watch from her jacket. "Crowley?"  
"随你便吧。" 拉斐尔耸了耸肩，从她的夹克里掏出了一个看起来像是怀表的东西。"克劳利？"

"Yes?" Crowley questioned.  
"什么事？" 克劳利质疑道。

"Here. Make sure neither Ligur or Aziraphale or any other angel get in here until this turns blue."  
这里。确保利古尔、阿齐拉费勒或任何其他天使在这里之前都不能进来，直到这变成蓝色为止。

She handed Crowley the trinket, and, after a look at the darkness inside, the demon nodded.  
她把小饰品递给了克劳利，魔鬼看了一眼里面的黑暗后点了点头。

"Should be within the next 24 hours," Raphael added. And turned to Hastur. "And you stay in bed, Mister."  
"应该在接下来的24小时内完成，"拉斐尔补充道。然后他转向哈斯图尔说道："你要好好待在床上，先生。"

Hastur smiled at her drunkenly.  
哈斯特醉醺醺地朝她微笑着。

"Aye, aye, ma'am." 是的，女士。

Meanwhile Crowley was prodding at the clothes strewn across the room.  
与此同时，克劳利正在房间里拨弄着散落的衣物。

"Do you think they're dry enough?" he called.  
"你觉得它们干得够吗？"他喊道。

"Put'em on an' find out," Hastur called back, voice slurring again as he drifted off to sleep.  
"穿上它们，然后试试看，"哈斯特喊道，声音再次含糊不清，他渐渐入睡。

Crowley frowned and simply started to pick up the various items, dropping them as various trinkets and a note tumbled from Hastur's pockets.  
克劳利皱了皱眉头，开始捡起各种物品，从哈斯特尔的口袋里掉出了一些小玩意和一张纸条。

"For Satan's sake, Crowley..." the older demon complained drowsily.  
"为了撒旦的缘故，克劳利..." 年长的恶魔昏昏欲睡地抱怨道。

"As if I meant to do that," Crowley murmured, picking up the loose change, the straight razor and the note. He had just put everything to the side, when his eyes fell on the latter.  
克劳利低声说：“仿佛我本意如此。”他捡起散落的零钱、剃刀和纸条。他刚刚把所有东西放到一边，当他的目光落在最后一样物品上时。

He quirked a brow. 他挑了挑眉毛。

"What did Aziraphale want from you?" He would recognize the handwriting anywhere.  
“亚齐拉费尔想从你那里得到什么？”他能在任何地方都辨认出那手写。

Hastur growled, pushing himself onto his elbows.  
哈斯特尔咆哮着，用手肘支撑着自己。

"Guess who gots us in this mess," he snarled.  
“猜猜是谁把我们弄进这个困境里了，”他咆哮着说道。

"What?" 什么？

Hastur groaned.. 哈斯特尔呻吟着。。

"Don't 'What' me, Fledgling. 'Twas yer fucking Principality what urged me to get the whole Dragging-to-Hell business done. Came up to me in the park, being all 'I know I should not do this, but it's for Crowley's sake'. All dithering and shite."  
别跟我说“什么”，新手。是你他妈的公国催促我把整个拖入地狱的事情搞定的。在公园里找到我，一副“我知道我不应该这样做，但这是为了克劳利”的样子。犹豫不决，一派胡言。

Crowley's brow furrowed, and so did Raphael's.  
克劳利的眉头紧锁，拉斐尔的眉头也紧皱起来。

Hastur, however, simply slumped back down into bed, falling asleep fairly quickly.  
然而，哈斯特尔只是无力地倒在床上，很快就入睡了。

"S'cuse me for a moment," Crowley murmured and stalked out of the room.  
"不好意思，稍等一下，" 克劳利低声说着，然后离开了房间。

"Angel?" "天使？"

Both Aziraphale and Ligur looked up as Crowley ducked into the back room.  
亚齐拉费尔和利古尔都抬头看着克劳利闪身进了后房间。

"Is this yours?" Crowley asked, not bothering to clarify who of the two he meant. That question was answered when he held the note out to Aziraphale.  
“这是你的吗？”克劳利问道，没有费心澄清他指的是两人中的哪一个。这个问题在他将纸条递给阿齐拉费尔时得到了回答。

"It is my handwriting, certainly," confirmed Aziraphale, but he looked at Crowley with confusion written all over his face. "But I can't recall writing it. What is it?"  
“这确实是我的笔迹。”亚齐拉费尔肯定地说道，但他满脸困惑地看着克劳利。“但我不记得写过这个。这是什么？”

"That's what got us into this mess," Crowley said, brows furrowing again.  
"这就是让我们陷入困境的原因，" 克劳利皱起眉头说道。

"Pardon?" 请再说一遍？

"Hastur says you told him to go to that house at that time."  
哈斯特尔说你告诉他在那个时间去那个房子。

"Hastur's awake?" Ligur interrupted, sounding hopeful.  
"哈斯特醒了吗？" 利古打断道，声音充满了希望。

"He's asleep again. Aziraphale, what's going on here?"  
他又睡着了。亚齐拉费尔，这里发生了什么事？

Before Aziraphale could answer Ligur rose, face blank.  
亚齐拉费尔还没来得及回答，利古尔起身，面无表情。

"I'd like t'know that, too," he said, his voice a dangerously low growl. "The shit that nearly killed Hastur was diluted Holy Water... humans can't make that. Angels can."  
“我也想知道。”他说道，声音低沉得带着一丝危险的咆哮。“那东西几乎要了哈斯特的命，是稀释过的圣水……人类无法制造出那种东西，只有天使能。”

Aziraphale's eyes widened in shock.  
亚齐拉费尔震惊地瞪大了眼睛。

"And you think I would...?"  
"你觉得我会...?"

"_I_ know you wouldn't," said Crowley. But didn't make it any further.  
“我知道你不会的。”克劳利说道。但他没有再多说。

"He wouldn't harm _you_," Ligur snarled, looking at the two. Crowley, by the looks of it, feared the worst. But Ligur just pushed past them.  
"他不会伤害你的，"利格尔咆哮着，看着两人。从克劳利的表情来看，他似乎对最坏的情况感到恐惧。但利格尔只是径直走过他们。

Aziraphale whimpered as the shop door was slammed shut. Ligur had gone, in a mood that was outright abysmal. By all means, this was the worst.  
当店门被砰地关上时，亚齐拉费尔发出了一声呜咽。利古尔已经走了，情绪极差。可以说，这是最糟糕的情况了。

"Crowley," Aziraphale began. "I don't..."  
"克劳利，"亚齐拉费尔开始说道。“我不...”

Crowley raised his hand, then snapped his fingers to get back into his own clothes.  
克劳利举起手，然后咔嗒一声响指，穿回了自己的衣服。

"I trust you, angel. But Ligur... I can't believe I'm saying this, but... I'll talk with him. Don't go to Hastur, you might kill him."  
我相信你，天使。但是Ligur...我简直不敢相信我会说这样的话，但是...我会和他谈谈。不要去找Hastur，你可能会杀了他。

Before Aziraphale could ask, Crowley was out the door, too. He stared down at the note.  
在亚齐拉费尔来得及问之前，克劳利也已经冲出了门。他凝视着那张纸条。

Whatever was going on, it wasn't anything good.  
不管发生了什么事情，都不是什么好事。

But frightening, that it was.  
但是令人害怕，那确实是。

"Gabriel! Michael!" Raziel greeted, as far as a 'greeting' was possible in the rattled state Raziel was in. "Thank the Almighty you're back."  
"加百列！迈克尔！" 拉齐尔打招呼，尽管在他如此紧张的状态下，“打招呼”这个词可能不太合适。 "感谢全能者你们回来了。"

"What's wrong?" Michael asked.  
"怎么了？" 迈克尔问道。

"You better come and see. We have a problem. A big, big problem."  
你最好过来看看。我们有麻烦了。一个很大，很大的问题。

This was where Heaven's artifacts were kept with the highest imaginable security.  
这是天堂神器被保管在最高可想象安全性的地方。

Artefacts like Gabriel's Horn, or Michael's Spear.  
像加百列的号角或迈克尔的长矛这样的文物。

And right now those two very Archangels, accompanied by Raziel, stood in front of the open door to the vault.  
此刻，这两位大天使，伴随着拉齐尔，站在敞开的地窖门前。

"That... is not good," Gabriel murmured, wringing his hands.  
"那...不太好," 加布里埃尔低声说着，双手紧紧握着。

"That's very much not good," said Michael.  
迈克尔说：“那真的很不好。”

As said, this _was_ where Heaven artifacts were kept... normally...  
就像说的那样，这里通常是存放天地宝物的地方...

"Isz that all?" hollered Beelzebub, slamming her hand on her desk. "A few trinketsz and a hunch?" She rubbed her temples. Asmodeus gave an equally exhausted shrug.  
"就这些吗？" 贝利泽布大声喊道，一边砰地拍着桌子。"只有一些小玩意和一种预感？" 她揉了揉太阳穴。阿斯莫德斯也无精打采地耸了耸肩。

"Mammon's up to _something_ at least," he said. "This's too odd to be harmless."  
他说：“魔鬼至少在搞些事情。这太奇怪了，不可能是无害的。”

"You say the same about me," said Belphegor, and Asmodeus gestured, exasperated.  
“你也这么说我，”贝尔菲戈说道，阿斯莫德耐心地做了个手势。

"I rest my case." 我不再辩驳。

"Quiet!" Beelzebub howled, the glower directed at the three other Archdemons in her office growing a little darker. "I have more important mattersz to szee to. If you have nothing better to offer, get out!"  
“安静！”贝尔塞巴斯咆哮道，目光凶狠地投向她办公室里的其他三位大恶魔。“我有更重要的事情要处理。如果你们没有更好的建议，就滚出去！”

Asmodeus winced, while Leviathan sneered.  
阿斯莫德痛苦地皱了皱眉，而利维坦则冷笑着。

"Don't say I didn't warn you," Leviathan muttered, and dragged Asmodeus - much to that one's dismay - out of the dingy office.  
“别说我没警告过你。”利维坦嘟囔着，然后把阿斯莫德斯拖出了那间肮脏的办公室，让后者非常不悦。

"And what are you waiting for?" snarled Beelzebub when Belphegor didn't budge.  
“你还在等什么？”当贝尔菲戈一动不动时，贝利亚尔咆哮道。

"You said to get out if we have nothing better to offer."  
你说过如果我们没有更好的东西提供，就要离开。

Beelzebub blinked once. Twice. And sank back in her chair with a resigned frown.  
贝尔芭布眨了一下眼睛。再次眨了眨眼。然后带着一丝无奈的皱眉坐回了椅子上。

"Szpill it." 倒出来。

"I know why Lou's gone."  
我知道为什么Lou走了。

"What hasz that got to do with... _How the Heaven do you know that?_"  
那跟...有什么关系？你怎么知道的？

Belphegor beamed proudly as Beelzebub jumped up.  
贝尔菲戈得意地笑了起来，当贝利泽布跳了起来。

"I'm responsible," she said, bouncing on her feet.  
她蹦蹦跳跳地说道：“我负责。”

"... what?" Beelzebub sank back down, staring at the other Archdemon in disbelief. Not disbelief at what she had just heard, though. Disbelief that she was even surprised.  
“……什么？”贝利泽布沉默了下来，怀疑地盯着另一个大恶魔。不是对她刚刚听到的内容感到怀疑，而是对自己竟然感到惊讶感到怀疑。

"Y'know how the whole 'being bound in Hell' always came with a 'till the end of days' or 'till kingdom come' when people talk 'bout it? I went and checked the wording, had nothing else to do, and it only mentions 'The day of Armageddon'... and that was two years ago."  
你知道吗，每当人们谈论“被困在地狱”时，总是会加上“直到世界末日”或者“直到王国降临”之类的话吗？我去查了一下措辞，无聊得没事可做，结果只提到了“末日审判之日”……而那已经是两年前的事了。

Beelzebub feel silent, the flies swarming her landing on the desk and looking at her in silence.  
贝尔则布感到沉默，苍蝇们蜂拥而至，落在桌子上静静地看着她。

"Szo... you told the Maszter..." she then began, voice devoid of any emotion. "And he..."  
“嗯...你告诉了大师...”她开始说道，声音毫无情感。“然后他...”

"Buggered off when he found he could."  
当他发现自己能够时，他就溜了。

"And you didn't tell me... why?"  
"而你没有告诉我...为什么？"

"It didn't worry you while you didn't know."  
在你不知道的时候，这并没有让你担心。

And in that moment Beelzebub looked as if she had no greater desire than a window in her office. Either to gaze out wistfully or to throw Belphegor through it.  
就在那一刻，贝利泽布看起来似乎没有比她办公室里的窗户更大的愿望。无论是凝视着遥远的景色，还是将贝尔菲戈扔出去。

"Any idea where he went?" said Beelzebub then.  
贝尔塞巴却问道：“他去哪儿了？”

"Yes." "是的。"

"Whe-" Beelzebub stopped herself. "I mean aszide from 'He left Hell'."  
“嗯——”贝尔芭布停了下来。“我是说，除了‘他离开了地狱’之外。”

"Oh." "哦。"

"Any idea where he went aszide from 'He left Hell'?"  
除了“他离开地狱”这句话，你有没有想法他去了哪里？

"No." 不。

Another frown. 又皱起了眉头。

"Juszt... go..." 就是...走吧...

She waved dismissively at the other Archdemon, and Belphegor left with a shrug, the flies taking to the air again as the door closed.  
她漫不经心地向另一个大恶魔挥了挥手，贝尔菲戈耸了耸肩，苍蝇们在门关闭时再次飞起来。

Beelzebub leaned back with an exhausted sigh, putting her feet up on the table.  
贝尔芭布松了一口气，疲惫地靠在椅背上，把脚搁在桌子上。

At least that answered some questions about Lucifer's absence. Even if it didn't bring things any further.  
至少这回答了一些关于路西法缺席的问题。即使没有进一步推动事情的发展。

This was all so bloody ridiculous. But alas, it wasn't surprising, was it? Two years since the failed Armageddon and the failed trial, the back-and-forth-and-hoppling-around when it came to diplomacy with Above, the changes to Hell, of course people were getting tetchy and paranoid. More than usual even.  
这一切都太可笑了。但唉，也不足为奇，是吧？自从那次失败的末日和失败的审判以来已经两年了，与上界的外交来回摇摆不定，地狱的变化，当然人们变得更加烦躁和多疑了。甚至比平常还要多。

Of course all of this, a surplus angel, Lucifer going missing, these weird trinkets and what Leviathan thinks those mean...  
当然，所有这一切，一个多余的天使，路西法失踪，这些奇怪的小玩意，以及利维坦认为它们意味着什么...

It was absolutely in line with Her kind of humor.  
这完全符合她的幽默品味。

Beelzebub rubbed her temples and wondered how this whole miserable affair would get worse.  
贝尔芭布揉了揉太阳穴，心里想着这整个糟糕的事情会变得更糟。

"Lord Beelzebub, we gots a problem."  
贝尔芬巴斯大人，我们有个问题。

Ah, there it was.🔄  ❓

Beelzebub begrudgingly sat up straight as Dagon entered, looking a bit out of breath.  
贝尔塞巴布勉强坐直，达贡进来时有些喘不过气来。

"What?" grumbled Beelzebub. "And where have you been? Could have needed you here."  
“什么？”贝尔塞巴卜咕哝着说道。“你去哪儿了？这里可能需要你。”

"Sorry, really. Our ferryman needed a word with me."  
抱歉，真的。我们的渡船夫需要和我说句话。

"Why?" Beelzebub blinked.  
“为什么？”贝尔撒巴瞪大了眼睛。

"Y'know them souls that try to get on the boat to sneak out of Hell?"  
你知道那些试图悄悄离开地狱的灵魂吗？

"What about them?" 他们怎么样？

"Charlie says he's not seen them for days now."  
查理说他好几天没见到他们了。

Beelzebub huffed. 贝尔芬格咕哝了一声。

"Szo they finally gave up. Good."  
所以他们最终放弃了。好的。

Dagon looked extremely disappointed.  
达贡看起来非常失望。

"Bee, they've been tryin' for thousands of years now. They wouldn't just give up." Dagon sighed. "And I fear they didn't..."  
“蜜蜂，它们已经努力了几千年了。它们不会轻易放弃的。”达贡叹了口气。“而且我担心它们并没有放弃……”

Beelzebub's brow furrowed.  
贝尔塞巴布皱起了眉头。

"What?" 什么？

"I crunched some numbers. They're gone."  
我计算了一些数字。它们不见了。

~⧖~

Crowley didn't know if the absence of death and demise on Ligur's path was due to the former demon being so pissed-off that he _didn't_ lash out at random bystanders and instead kept it all inside, or if it were cause Ligur was an angel again and was barred from lashing out by Heaven.  
克劳利不知道利古尔的道路上没有死亡和毁灭的原因是因为这位前恶魔太生气了，不会随意攻击旁观者，而是将一切都压在心里，还是因为利古尔再次成为了天使，受到天堂的禁止而不能发泄。

Whatever it was, it worried Crowley. Immensely so.  
无论是什么，这让克劳利感到担忧。非常担忧。

"You don't really think Aziraphale would do that?" Crowley gasped, finally catching up with Ligur in the park.  
“你真的认为亚齐拉费尔会那么做吗？”克劳利喘着气，在公园里终于追上了利古尔。

The other gave him a deathly glare over his shoulder and kept walking.  
另一个人冷冷地瞪了他一眼，然后继续走了。

"Dun gimme that. You thought it too."  
别给我那一套。你也这么想过。

Crowley pulled himself together.  
克劳利振作起来。

"No," he said. "I was surprised that Aziraphale went to help Hastur with Hell's business."  
“不，”他说。“我很惊讶亚齐拉费尔会去帮助哈斯图尔处理地狱的事务。”

"There you have it." Ligur snarled, and nestled his face as deep into his scarf as his hands were buried into his coat's pockets.  
就是这样了。利古尔咆哮着，把脸埋得和他的手深深地藏在大衣口袋里。

Crowley stopped briefly to send an annoyed glance towards the sky..  
克劳利停下来，稍微不悦地朝天空投去一瞥。

"But that doesn't mean Aziraphale had anything to do with..." he began.  
“但这并不意味着亚齐拉费尔与……有任何关系。”他开始说道。

"An' where else should that guy have gotten it from?" Ligur growled, finally stopping. "Humans can't dilute Holy Water. Humans think a drop of it would render ev'ry body of water bloody holy."  
“那家伙还能从哪里得到呢？”利古尔咆哮着，最终停下了脚步。“人类无法稀释圣水。人类认为一滴圣水就能让每一滴水都变得神圣。”

"They also think women can't be pope."  
他们还认为女性不能当教皇。

This got a snort out of Ligur.  
这让利古尔发出了一声哼笑。

"They think the Vatican's holy ground, while we're at it," he said, but shook his head. "But, fuck it, where else should the guy have gotten Holy Water from?"  
他说：“他们认为梵蒂冈是神圣的地方，顺便说一下。”但他摇了摇头。“但是，该死的，这家伙还能从哪里拿到圣水呢？”

He and Crowley stood in silence for a moment, the other visitors to the park flowing around them. Crowley might have picked a more insistent and heartfelt answer, had Ligur not looked at him as hurt as he did.  
他和克劳利静静地站了一会儿，公园里的其他游客在他们周围流动。如果利古尔没有像他那样伤心地看着他，克劳利可能会给出一个更坚决和真挚的回答。

"Look,"  Crowley began carefully. "If that guy messed with Hell, who's saying he didn't mess with Heaven too? Got scared, asked an angel for Holy Water in case of... I really should shut up now, shouldn't I?"  
"听着，"克劳利小心地开始说道。"如果那个家伙惹毛了地狱，谁能说他没惹毛天堂呢？他可能害怕了，找了个天使要了圣水，以防万一...我现在应该闭嘴了，对吧？"

"Yeah. Yeah you should." "是的。是的，你应该这样做。"

Ligur motioned him to sit down on a nearby bench.  
利古尔示意他在附近的长椅上坐下。

Crowley did, staring ahead.  
克劳利一直盯着前方。

"Sorry," he murmured. "对不起，" 他低声说道。

Ligur shook his head and sat down next to him.  
利古尔摇了摇头，坐在他旁边。

"Stop apologizing. Yer a demon."  
别再道歉了。你是个恶魔。

"I know what I'd be like if someone would do that to Aziraphale."  
我知道如果有人对亚齐拉费尔做那样的事情，我会变成什么样子。

"But no one did it to Aziraphale. Aziraphale did it to Hastur."  
但没有人对亚齐拉费尔这样做。亚齐拉费尔对哈斯特尔这样做了。

Crowley bristled. 克劳利怒气冲冲。

"You don't know that..." He frowned. "C'mon, Ligur. Do you really think he would? You know him. You worked with him. Would he really do something like that?"  
"你不知道..." 他皱了皱眉头。"拜托，利古尔。你真的认为他会吗？你了解他。你和他一起工作过。他会真的做那样的事吗？"

Ligur blinked. 利古尔眨了眨眼睛。

"What?" 什么？

Crowley sighed. 克劳利叹了口气。

"The Jack the Ripper thing. Aziraphale told me."  
"杰克·雷普尔的事情。阿齐拉费尔告诉我的。"

"Did he now?" "他现在这样了吗？"

"Yes. He told me everything."  
是的。他告诉我一切。

Ligur's eyebrows shot up into his hairline.  
利古尔的眉毛瞬间挑得高高的。

"_Did_ he now?" "他现在这样了吗？"

"Yes, he did." Crowley seemed a little baffled.  
"是的，他做了。" 克劳利似乎有点困惑。

"And you're okay wi' that?"  
"你对此没意见吗？"

"Yeah. Aziraphale can make his own decisions. Would be creepy if he'd always go 'Oh, would Crowley approve of this'."  
"是的，亚齐拉菲尔可以自己做决定。如果他总是说 '哦，克劳利会同意这个吗'，那就有点可怕了。"

Ligur whistled through his teeth.  
利古尔用嘴发出了一个口哨声。

"Well, if he does trust y'enough t' tell ya that... unless he wanted to piss you off."  
嗯，如果他足够信任你而告诉你这件事……除非他想惹你生气。

"With _that_? Naw." 这个？算了吧。

Ligur nodded slowly and leaned back on the bench.  
利古尔慢慢点了点头，靠在长凳上向后倚靠。

"You got a better idea?"  
你有更好的主意吗？

"Mhn?" "嗯？"

"'Bout what happened." "关于发生的事情。"

Crowley wrung his hands. 克劳利握紧了双手。

"I..." Then an idea hit him. "Hey, there's this guy that looks like Aziraphale and..."  
"我..." 然后一个主意突然闪过他的脑海。"嘿，有个人长得像阿齐拉费尔，然后..."

Ligur snorted without any amusement.  
利古尔不屑地哼了一声，毫无乐趣可言。

"Eh, sure. Some random guy wot looks like Aziraphale who happens to know 'bout Hastur and that whole draggin'-to-Hell thing an' who happens to have..."  
嗯，好的。有个看起来像阿齐拉费尔的随便一个家伙，碰巧知道哈斯特和那整个拖入地狱的事情，碰巧还有...

"Alright, alright," Crowley said, head in his hands. "I dunno what happened. But I know that Aziraphale wouldn't do something like that."  
“好了，好了。”克劳利双手托着脑袋说道，“我不知道发生了什么。但我知道阿齐拉费尔不会做那种事。”

Ligur sat back and stared at the sky.  
利古尔靠在椅子上，凝视着天空。

"Well," he then said. "Easy way to find out."  
"嗯，"他接着说道。"找出答案的方法很简单。"

"Huh?" Crowley staggered to his feet after Ligur had suddenly gotten up, and stumbled after the former demon.  
“嗯？”克劳利在利古尔突然站起来后摇摇晃晃地站了起来，然后跌跌撞撞地跟在这位前恶魔的后面。

"Gonna get me chameleon and ask Upstairs if Aziraphale did any bloody miracle to make Holy Water."  
我要弄只变色龙，然后问楼上的人，阿齐拉费尔是否做了什么血腥的奇迹来制造圣水。

"Umm..." 嗯...

Well, that was just ridiculously easy, wasn't it?  
嗯，这真是太简单了，不是吗？

Then Crowley paused. 然后克劳利停顿了一下。

"Huh. Didn't notice you didn't have the chameleon with you."  
哎呀，没注意到你没带变色龙。

Ligur smirked at him. 利古尔冷笑着看着他。

"Goes t'show how well you pay attention."  
这就说明你注意力有多好。

Crowley bristled a little, but said nothing. He wanted to sort this thing out, and the less he talked, the quicker, he reckoned, that would be done.  
克劳利有点生气，但什么也没说。他想解决这件事，他觉得自己越少说话，就能越快解决。

Only when they arrived at the flat did he speak up.  
只有当他们到达公寓时，他才开口说话。

"I just hope Heaven's bureaucracy won't be a bunch of arses..."  
我只希望天堂的官僚机构不会是一群混蛋...

"I dealt with Dagon," said Ligur. "There's nothing in Hea-" he snapped his mouth shut, gaze fixed on the flat's door.  
“我处理了达贡，”利古尔说道。“在海——”他咬紧了嘴唇，目光盯着公寓的门。

Crowley said nothing. Something was wrong and he felt it too.  
克劳利什么也没说。有什么不对劲，他也感觉到了。

"Let me," he whispered, and stretched a little.  
“让我来吧。”他低声说着，然后伸了个懒腰。

And a little more, till he laid coiled up in his snake form on the floor. Ligur carefully and silently nudged the door open, and Crowley slithered in.  
再多一点，直到他以蛇形蜷缩在地板上。利古尔小心而无声地推开门，克劳利蠕动着进去。

There was an odd demonic presence in the flat, something oddly familiar about it.  
公寓里有一种奇怪的恶魔存在，它有一种奇怪的熟悉感。

Crowley moved along the walls and between furniture, always peeking up to the ceiling.  
克劳利沿着墙壁和家具之间移动，总是偷偷地朝天花板看。

You never know. 你永远不知道。

He stopped before the main plant room, and pressed himself into the shadows. There was a movement of something quite a bit bigger than a chameleon.  
他停在主要的机房前，融入了阴影之中。有一种比变色龙大得多的东西在动。

"I'm terribly sorry, dearie," said a voice that made Crowley's eyes go wide. Aziraphale. "But having you 'round won't do. Not after what you did."  
“亲爱的，非常抱歉。”一个声音让克劳利瞪大了眼睛。阿齐拉费尔。“但是你待在这里不合适。尤其是在你做了那件事之后。”

This was followed by a heartwrenching squeak, and no matter what or whom Crowley had thought he had heard, now he went into protective mode, shifting his form and leaping at the shadow.  
紧接着，传来一声令人心碎的尖叫，不管克劳利之前认为自己听到了什么或者是谁，此刻他立刻进入了保护模式，变换形态，向着阴影扑去。

He connected with something that felt the way he had expected, but reeked of Hell.  
他与某种感觉相连，正如他所预料的那样，但却散发着地狱的气息。

They tumbled across the floor, something falling onto the carpet behind them, and then Crowley was on the intruder, getting a decent look at them.  
他们在地板上滚来滚去，有东西掉在他们身后的地毯上，然后克劳利就扑向了入侵者，好好地看了看他们。

What escaped Crowley's mouth then was a combination of blessings swears and words so long forgotten to humans that it was impossible to categorize them as either.  
克劳利嘴里逃出的是一连串祝福、咒骂和那些被人类遗忘已久的词语，以至于无法将它们归类为任何一种。

The other bucked and punched Crowley in the side, scrabbling to his feet and rushing for the window.  
另一个家伙朝克劳利的侧腹猛击一拳，然后挣扎着站起身，冲向窗户。

A shattering of glass and he was gone before Crowley was back on his feet.  
玻璃碎裂声响起，克劳利还没站稳脚，他就已经消失了。

"What the _fuck_!" Crowley coughed and staggered up. And turned as he heard some cursing behind him.  
“他妈的！”克劳利咳嗽着艰难地站起来，听到身后有人咒骂，他转过身去。

And his heart sank as he saw Ligur cradling the little chameleon.  
当他看到利古尔抱着那只小变色龙时，他的心沉了下去。

"Is it... did that..." 是...那个...

Ligur sighed, gently stroking the little creature, his hand glowing softly.  
利古尔叹了口气，轻轻地抚摸着那只小动物，他的手柔和地发出微光。

"Fucker nearly cut his tail off," he growled. "But he'll be fine."  
“这混蛋差点把尾巴剁掉了，”他咆哮道。“不过他会没事的。”

Crowley absent-mindedly summoned up some bandages, handing them over.  
克劳利心不在焉地召唤出一些绷带，递给了对方。

"Thank you." 谢谢。

"Don't mention it," said Crowley, miracling the window fixed. "What the fuck did I just see?!"  
“别客气。”克劳利说着，用神奇的力量修好了窗户。“我刚才到底看到了什么？！”

Ligur, patching up the little creature, growled lowly.  
利古尔低声咆哮着，给这个小生物修补伤口。

"Beats me. But they sure as fuck looked like Aziraphale."  
我不知道。但他们看起来确实像阿齐拉费尔。

~⧖~

Mary Hodges had been a Satanic nun, which meant she had a fair understanding of which bits about it the general public got completely wrong. Or more precisely, as her current existence as a business woman had shown her, the general public was actually spot on about all the bits, they just got the group of people wrong.  
玛丽·霍奇斯曾经是一位撒旦教修女，这意味着她对公众对此的误解有相当的了解。或者更准确地说，正如她作为一名商业女性的现实生活所展示的那样，公众对于所有这些误解都是完全正确的，只是他们把人群搞错了。

Business was war, the old dog eat dog thing...  
商业就是战争，老狗吃老狗的事情...

And Mary Hodges was having none of it anymore.  
玛丽·霍奇斯再也不愿意忍受这一切了。

The past two years had been a bit of a mess (a failed Apocalypse does that to you) and while Mary found it easy to find what business desired, it got exponentially harder to provide with all the competition around.  
过去的两年有些混乱（一个失败的启示录会让你变得如此），尽管玛丽发现找到商机很容易，但由于周围竞争的加剧，提供服务变得越来越困难。

So Mary began focussing on those that looked for something else than what the media claimed the mass wanted.  
所以玛丽开始关注那些寻求与媒体所声称的大众需求不同的人。

Which turned out to be quite a lot of people.  
结果发现是相当多的人。

Right now she was organizing a charity event on the shortest notice she could imagine.  
她现在正在以她能想象到的最短时间准备一个慈善活动。

"I must thank you again, Miss Hodges, for hosting our little endeavor on such short notice," said the man sitting in front of the desk. "I hope it isn't too much trouble."  
坐在桌前的男人说道：“霍奇斯小姐，我必须再次感谢您在这么短的时间内安排我们的小活动。希望这不会给您带来太多麻烦。”

"Oh, not at all, Dr Sable," said Miss Hodges. "True, two weeks notice is a short time, but as you are providing security and catering," the woman next to Sable chuckled a little.  
“哦，一点也不，Sable博士，”霍奇斯小姐说道。“没错，两周的通知时间确实很短，但既然您提供了安全和餐饮，”Sable旁边的女士轻笑了一下。

"Yes, yes," said Sable with a thin smile. "It's really _a shame_ about the initial avenue."  
“是的，是的，”Sable带着一丝浅浅的微笑说道。“最初的大道真是可惜。”

Mary Hodges noticed the odd emphasis Dr Sable put on those words and the displeased sideglance he gave his companion.🔄  ❓

The woman in red gave a slight, defeated sigh, before Sable turned back to Miss Hodges and the documents laid out neatly on the desk.  
穿着红色衣服的女人轻轻地叹了口气，显露出一丝失败的气息，然后Sable转身回到霍奇斯小姐和整齐摆放在桌子上的文件面前。

The clock ticked by while he read everything, and his companion was getting restless.  
当他读着一切的时候，时钟滴答滴答地走着，他的伴侣开始变得不耐烦起来。

"If you don't mind," she said in a meaningful tone.  
她以一种有深意的语气说道：“如果你不介意的话。”

"Down the corridor, down the stairs, second door to the right," said Miss Hodges.  
霍奇斯小姐说：“沿着走廊走，下楼梯，右手边第二扇门。”

Ruby rose from her seat.  
Ruby从座位上站起来。

"Thank you." 谢谢。

Not that she actually needed to know the way to the restrooms.  
她其实并不需要知道去洗手间的路。

She just really needed to get out of that office and stretch her legs a little.  
她只是真的需要离开办公室，稍微活动一下腿部。

And sort her thoughts. 整理她的思绪。

It was ridiculous, wasn't it?  
这太荒谬了，不是吗？

That they'd end up in this place of all places again? Sure, it was for reasons unrelated to Armageddon this time around, but that did nothing for the headache she felt creeping around her temples.  
他们会再次来到这个地方，真是让人想不到。虽然这次与世界末日无关，但对于她来说，这并没有减轻她头痛的感觉。

She stalked out of the building and into the courtyard.  
她气冲冲地走出大楼，来到庭院里。

It wouldn't hurt if she would march onto the street and into the village. So she did. Sable would see to her not being missed.  
她走上街头，进入村庄也无妨。于是她就这么做了。Sable会确保她不会被人注意到。

And in case of doubt she could still call him and say she went for a walk. After all, she was only here because...  
万一她有疑问，她还可以给他打电话，说她出去散步了。毕竟，她之所以在这里只是因为...

"Shouldn't you be dead?" a voice called and Ruby spun around to face the teenage girl addressing her. She remembered the kid.  
“你不是应该死了吗？”一个声音喊道，Ruby转过身来面对那个对她说话的少女。她记得这个孩子。

"Shouldn't you be at school?"  
你不应该在学校吗？

Pepper shrugged and wheeled her bike closer.  
佩珀耸了耸肩，将自行车推近了一些。

"We got the day off. Teachers got in a fight. So, ah, Thanks."  
我们放了一天假。老师们打起来了。所以，啊，谢谢。

Ruby crossed her arms. Ruby双臂交叉。

"Pff, don't menti-" she narrowed her eyes. "Hold up a second. How do you...?"  
“呸，别提了。”她眯起眼睛说道，“等一下，你怎么知道……？”

"Oh, Adam told us. Said it's not fair if we'd have all those fuzzy memories flopping 'round in our heads like a... is it drowning what fish do on land?"  
哦，亚当告诉我们了。他说如果我们的脑袋里有那么多模糊的回忆晃来晃去，就不公平了，就像...是鱼在陆地上淹死吗？

Ruby blinked and shrugged.  
Ruby眨了眨眼，耸了耸肩。

"Err... technically. I guess."  
嗯...从技术上讲。我猜是这样的。

"You ain't here for more funny business, are you?" said Pepper in a tone that was so innocently curious and coldheartedly accusing that Ruby couldn't help but feel a good chunk of respect for the girl.  
"你不是来搞笑的吧？"佩珀以一种既天真好奇又冷酷指责的语气说道，这让鲁比不禁对这个女孩产生了相当的尊敬。

"Adam told us everything," Pepper continued, now standing so close that only a sudden jerk of the bike separated Ruby's shins from making painful acquaintance with the front wheel.  
"亚当告诉我们一切，"佩珀继续说道，现在站得离得这么近，以至于自行车突然一抖，才让鲁比的小腿与前轮痛苦地相遇。

Ruby wrinkled her nose. Ruby皱了皱鼻子。

"No. Just regular business. Where's the boy anyway?"  
没有，只是普通的生意。那个男孩在哪里呢？

"Down with a cold. Half the school is."  
感冒了。学校里有一半的人都感冒了。

"Oh?" Something about that piqued Ruby's interest and she couldn't tell why. It wasn't that she would have expected the Antichrist to never fall ill, he was human after all\* but something about it made her hair stand on end.  
"哦？" 这件事引起了Ruby的兴趣，她不知道为什么。并不是说她期望反基督从不生病，毕竟他也是人类\*，但这件事让她感到不安。

It couldn't be possible that...?  
这难道可能是不可能的吗？

\*Sort of. And too much of it in any case, in Ruby's opinion.  
有点吧。而且在Ruby看来，无论如何都太多了。

"What sort of regular business?" asked Pepper, ripping Ruby from her thoughts.  
"什么样的常规业务？"佩珀问道，打断了鲁比的思绪。

"You're nosy." 你很爱管闲事。

"You've been a reporter."  
你一直都是一名记者。

Now what the...? 现在是什么情况...？

"How much did the boy bloody well tell you?"  
那个小子到底告诉你多少了？

"Not that. I know you from the nonsense papers. Had your picture in'em."  
不是那个。我从那些胡言乱语的报纸上认识你。上面有你的照片。

Ruby drew a deep and exhausted breath.  
Ruby深深地吸了一口气，感到筋疲力尽。

"Alright. Alright. So. Adam. He told you everything?"  
好的。好的。那么。亚当。他把一切都告诉你了吗？

Pepper shrugged. 佩珀耸了耸肩。

"So he says. But I think there's something he don't tell us. Cause he's got no idea what it is."  
他这么说。但我觉得他有些事情没有告诉我们。因为他根本不知道那是什么。

Ruby looked up. The wind, for once having impeccable dramatic timing, played forebodingly through her hair.  
Ruby抬头看着。风，这一次具备了无可挑剔的戏剧性时机，凶兆般地吹拂着她的头发。

"Well, there _is_ something in the air.  
嗯，空气中有些不同寻常的东西。

~⧖~

The problem, mused Aziraphale, was that none of this made any sense.  
问题在于，阿齐拉费尔苦思冥想，这一切都毫无意义。

No matter how he turned it, things just wouldn't fit together.  
无论他怎么转弯抹角，事情就是无法拼凑在一起。

"I believe we will only be treading water until Hastur's awake," said Aziraphale, and put his cup down. "How long do you think will that take?"  
“我相信在哈斯特尔苏醒之前，我们只能原地踏步。”亚齐拉费尔说着，放下了杯子。“你认为那需要多长时间？”

"He got through the procedure better than expected. But he _is_ weak. He'll prolly sleep the whole weekend through."  
他的手术进展比预期要好。但他很虚弱。他可能会整个周末都睡觉。

Aziraphale nodded, folded his hands and drummed his fingers on his knuckles.  
亚齐拉费尔点了点头，双手交叉放在一起，用指节敲击着手指。

"This is dreadful, really dreadful. And Ligur obviously thinks the worst of me now."  
这太可怕了，真的太可怕了。而且利古尔现在显然对我有着最坏的看法。

"You said as much," said Raphael, who had just spent the last half an hour or so listening to Aziraphale's worries about Ligur's reaction.  
“你说得没错。”拉斐尔说道，他刚刚花了大约半个小时听阿兹拉菲尔对利古尔的反应感到担忧。

"I hope he knows I would never do such a thing." Aziraphale shook his head.  
“我希望他知道我绝对不会做这种事。”亚齐拉费尔摇了摇头。

"Ligur isn't dumb, Aziraphale. But he can only go by what he has."  
利古尔不傻，阿齐拉费尔。但他只能根据他所拥有的去行动。

Aziraphale picked up the note and turned it in his hands.  
亚齐拉费尔拿起纸条，在手中翻转着。

"I still don't understand how this is possible. It is my handwriting, yes. But..."  
我还是不明白这怎么可能。这确实是我的字迹，没错。但是...

Raphael leaned forward and patted his hand.  
拉斐尔向前倾身，拍了拍他的手。

"Again, you said as much." She smiled. But then sat up straight all of a sudden, her face hardening.  
“再说一遍，你说得没错。”她微笑着。但突然间，她坐直了身子，脸上变得严肃起来。

"What's wrong?" Then Aziraphale felt and odd, alarming tingle go up and down his spine.  
"怎么了？" 然后亚齐拉费尔感到一股奇怪而令人不安的刺痛沿着他的脊椎上下传来。

Just a blink later the door opened, Crowley and Ligur coming in, both more than a little agitated.  
眨眼之后，门打开了，克劳利和利古尔走了进来，两人都有些不安。

Well, Ligur was... 嗯，Ligur是...

Crowley however seemed to be babbling deliriously.  
然而，克劳利似乎正在胡言乱语。

"Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!" Ligur howled, holding Crowley upright. "Raphael? We need a hand here."  
"闭嘴。闭嘴。闭嘴！" 利古尔咆哮着，扶着克劳利站起来。“拉斐尔？我们需要帮忙。”

Raphael was over in a flash, as was Aziraphale.  
拉斐尔一闪而过，阿齐拉费尔也是如此。

The latter winced loudly as he saw Crowley's state.  
后者看到克劳利的状态，忍不住大声哀叹。

The demon was pale as a sheet, matted hair clinging to his forehead with cold sweat, and blood drippling from his nose.  
那个恶魔脸色苍白如纸，头发黏在额头上，冷汗淋漓，鼻子滴血。

"What... what happened?" Aziraphale managed. Raphael let out a frustrated groan.  
“发生了什么……发生了什么？”亚齐拉费尔勉强说出。拉斐尔发出一声沮丧的呻吟。

"Got a bigger dose of Holy Water than you said," she stated and shook her head.  
她说道：“你说的圣水剂量比我想象的要大。”她摇了摇头。

Crowley gave a protesting cough.  
克劳利咳嗽了一声表示抗议。

"'Twasn't the Holy Water," said Ligur, guiding Crowley to the couch. "'Twas a bloody holy dagger."  
“不是圣水，”利古尔说着，引导克劳利走向沙发。“是一把血腥的圣剑。”

Aziraphale and Raphael stared at him. Then Raphael nodded.  
阿齐拉费尔和拉斐尔盯着他看，然后拉斐尔点了点头。

"Go ahead." 请继续。

While she moved to check Crowley over, Ligur sat down heavily.  
当她走过去检查克劳利时，利古尔沉重地坐了下来。

"Good news, Aziraphale, maybe yer cleared of all charges. _Maybe_."  
好消息，阿齐拉费尔，也许你被所有指控都洗清了。也许。

"Come again?" Aziraphale blinked.  
"再说一遍？"亚齐拉费尔眨了眨眼睛。

"We had a little run in with yer doppelgänger."  
我们和你的分身有点小冲突。

"Pardon?" 请再说一遍？

"We got back to the flat an' ran into someone looking like you."  
我们回到公寓，碰到了一个长得像你的人。

"Oh." 哦。

Who'd have thought. 谁能想到呢。

"No idea who that was," Ligur frowned, "but he tried to cut me little buddy here into ribbons."  
“不知道那是谁，”利古尔皱着眉头说，“但他试图把我的小伙伴切成丝带。”

The little creature looked up a bit drowsily.  
小动物有点昏昏欲睡地抬起头来。

"Crowley drove him out, the wanker dropped his knife, and then Crowley wanted t'ave a look at it... cuts himself. Should of known something was wrong. He's been walking wonkier than usual. Next thing I knew he keels over, nearly crashing the bloody car."  
克劳利把他赶了出去，那个混蛋掉了刀子，然后克劳利想看看它... 结果割到自己了。早该知道有问题了。他走起路来比平时更不稳。接下来我就看到他倒下去，差点把车撞翻了。

"'Twas blessed," Crowley murmured while Raphael saw to a nasty cut on his hand. "Why did he have a blessed knife?"  
“真是受祝福的。”克劳利低声说道，而拉斐尔则在给他手上的伤口处理。 “他为什么有一把受祝福的刀？”

"Save your energy," Raphael said, and hauled him onto his feet. "Let's get you upstairs. Ligur, bring yer chameleon. Little thing could do wi' some rest too."  
“省点力气吧。”拉斐尔说着，把他扶起来。“咱们上楼吧。利古尔，带上你的变色龙。小家伙也需要休息一下。”

"Why did he have a blessed knife?" Crowley repeated, nearly sobbing. "He's a demon."  
克劳利重复着：“他为什么有一把被祝福的刀？”几乎是哭泣的声音。“他是个恶魔。”

Aziraphale stopped in the middle of walking over to help Raphael.  
亚齐拉费尔停下脚步，正要走过去帮助拉斐尔。

"What did you say?" 你说什么？

Ligur stepped to his side and smiled a humorless smile.  
利古尔走到他身旁，露出一丝毫无幽默感的微笑。

"The best part 'bout this mess. Whoever your doppelgänger is, he's a demon."  
这个烂摊子最好的部分就是，不管你的分身是谁，他都是个恶魔。

~⧖~

"This is bad. This is horrible."  
这很糟糕。这太可怕了。

Michael clung to the cup of tea so hard that it made Uriel worry Michael would break it.  
迈克尔紧紧抓住茶杯，以至于乌里尔担心迈克尔会把它打破。

Michael had never drank tea before, but desperate times required desperate actions. She needed everything available to soothe her nerves now.  
迈克尔以前从未喝过茶，但绝望的时刻需要绝望的举动。她现在需要一切可以安抚她的神经的东西。

"It's going to be alright," said Uriel, rubbing Michael's back.  
"没事的，" Uriel 说着，轻轻地拍着 Michael 的背。

"I know, I know, I told Gabriel as much. It's just..." Michael frowned and shook her head. "This is impossible. There's no logical explanation for it."  
我知道，我知道，我已经告诉加百列了。只是……"迈克尔皱了皱眉头，摇了摇头。"这是不可能的。没有任何合乎逻辑的解释。"

"There has to be." 必须有。

Michael sighed and downed her tea.  
迈克尔叹了口气，一饮而尽她的茶。

"Hit me up if you find one. Only a handful of us can even access the vault. There's no clue to who could have done it, or when. And why would anyone steal those things?"  
如果你找到了，给我打个电话。只有我们几个人能进入保险库。没有任何线索能指出是谁做的，或者是什么时候做的。而且为什么会有人偷那些东西呢？

"They are some of the most powerful artifacts in creation. Gabriel's horn and spear, your sword, my lantern..."  
它们是创世界上最强大的神器之一。加百列的号角和长矛，你的剑，我的灯笼...

"But what would anyone in Heaven _want_ with them? So desperately that they'd steal them? If there'd be a chance that Hell took them, this would make some sense, but... There never was any. And now there's even less of a chance..." Michael shook her head. "I'll be honest. I'm really worried about Gabriel. He took this much worse than I would have expected."  
“但是天堂的人会对它们有什么渴望呢？渴望到要去偷它们？如果地狱有可能拿走它们，这还有点道理，但是……从来没有这样的可能。现在甚至更不可能了……”迈克尔摇了摇头。“说实话，我真的很担心加百列。他对此的反应比我预期的要糟糕得多。”

"Sandalphon and Raziel are keeping an eye on him. He'll be fine."  
桑达尔芬和拉齐尔正在关注他。他会没事的。

"I know, it's just..." 我知道，只是...

There was the squealing of soles on tile and Raziel skidded around the corner.  
瓷砖上发出了尖叫声，Raziel在拐角处打滑。

"Mike, Uriel. We have a problem. A new one I mean."  
迈克，乌里尔。我们有个问题。一个新的问题，我的意思是。

The two other Archangels sat up alarmed.  
另外两位大天使惊慌地坐了起来。

"What happened?" Michael demanded.  
发生了什么事？迈克尔要求道。

"We were talking with Gabriel, telling him everything will be alright, and Sandalphon noted how the Boss ought to have kicked whoever did this out of Heaven by now. I wondered where the horn and the spear and so forth are then, and... well, Gabe went all catatonic and started mumbling about having failed and about the Fallen and... I've never seen him like that. I maybe shouldn't have said that."  
我们正在和加百列交谈，告诉他一切都会好起来，桑达尔芬提到老板现在应该已经把那个做这种事的人赶出天堂了。我想知道那时候那些号角和长矛在哪里，然后...嗯，加百列突然变得呆滞了，开始嘟囔着自己失败了，还有堕落者...我从未见过他那样。也许我不该说那些话。

Michael put her cup away and stepped over.  
迈克尔把她的杯子放好，然后走了过去。

"Where is Gabriel now?" "Gabriel现在在哪里？"

Raziel gulped. 拉齐尔咽了口水。

"Sands sent me out to calm Gabriel down. I left, I mean Sandalphon knows Gabriel better than most of us, but Gabriel's never been like that before, so I went back, but..."  
沙恩让我出去安抚加百列。我离开了，我的意思是桑达尔芬比我们大多数人更了解加百列，但加百列以前从来没有这样过，所以我又回去了，但是...

"But?" asked Michael and Uriel in unison and in a tone indicating they had a good and not very nice idea where this was going.  
“但是？”迈克尔和乌里尔异口同声地问道，语气中透露出他们对接下来的情况有一个好的但并不太好的想法。

"When I came there, Sandalphon had been knocked out. And Gabriel... was gone."  
当我到达那里时，桑达尔芬已经被打昏了。而加百列...不见了。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

~⧖~

The first thing Hastur figured upon waking was that he ought to stop with the whole nearly dying and losing consciousness spiel. Bad choice for a hobby, really wasn't his thing at all.  
哈斯特醒来后首先想到的是，他应该停止那种几乎死去和失去意识的把戏。选择这种爱好真是个糟糕的决定，实在不适合他。

The second thing was that he wasn't alone in bed anymore.  
第二件事是他不再独自一人躺在床上了。

He was laying on his side, head half sunken into the pillow, and something small and warm and... scaly was laying on his face.  
他侧躺着，头半埋在枕头里，脸上有一些小而温暖的东西……有点鳞片的感觉。

Cautiously he moved a hand up to whatever it was, his muscles tensing.  
小心地，他抬起一只手去触摸那个东西，肌肉绷紧。

Now, the plan had been to grab whatever laid on his face and throw it across the room, preferably against the wall.  
现在，计划是抓住他脸上的任何东西，然后将其扔到房间的另一边，最好是撞在墙上。

But the ordeals Hastur had been put through had taken their toll on him, and the attempted grab and throw turned into the demon drowsily slapping himself.  
但是哈斯图尔所经历的磨难已经对他造成了伤害，试图抓住并扔掉的举动变成了恶魔昏昏欲睡地自己打了自己一巴掌。

Great, now his face hurt even more. He grumbled, blessing the whole bloody everything, when the thing rolled off his face. Hastur immediately regretted the 'grab-and-throw' plan the moment his eyes focused on Ligur's chameleon, which was right now lying on his back, tiny feet kicking at the air and pillow in a struggle to turn back right-side-up.  
太好了，现在他的脸更疼了。他嘟囔着，诅咒着整个该死的一切，当那东西从他脸上滚落下来时。哈斯特一看到利古尔的变色龙，立刻后悔起了自己的“抓住然后扔掉”的计划。此刻，变色龙正躺在他的背上，小脚在空中踢着，枕头上挣扎着想要翻过来。

Hastur bit back a yawn and turned the little creature around, looking puzzled at the bandages on the tail and front paws.  
哈斯特压住一个打哈欠，把小动物转过身来，对尾巴和前爪上的绷带感到困惑。

And he was getting angry.  
他开始生气了。

"Who the fuck hurt you," he whispered, giving the yawning little thing scritches.  
“谁他妈的伤害了你？”他低声说着，给那只打哈欠的小家伙抚摸着。

"A demon version of Aziraphale," someone said in a distinct matter-of-facts-I-would-like-to-disregard voice, and Hastur blinked slowly, gazing around, confused.  
“一个恶魔版本的阿齐拉费尔，”有人用一种明显的事实陈述的声音说道，哈斯特尔慢慢眨了眨眼，困惑地四处张望着。

"Wha-...? Oh." He had needed a moment to spot Crowley in the other bed, mainly on account of the younger demon having wrapped himself up in the duvet, only a sickly pale and sweaty face peeking out. "An' who put you through the wringer?"  
"什么...？哦。"他需要一会儿才能在另一张床上发现克劳利，主要是因为年轻的恶魔裹着被子，只露出一张病态苍白而汗湿的脸。"谁把你折磨成这样了？"

"Same answer as before," said Crowley, reluctantly squirming out of his cocoon. He coughed. "There's some demon running around looking like Aziraphale."  
克劳利勉强地从他的茧中挣扎出来，说道：“和之前一样的答案。”他咳嗽了一声。“有个恶魔在外面到处乱跑，长得像阿齐拉费尔。”

Hastur blinked again, more blearily, and propped himself up on one arm. Rather unsteadily, one should add.  
哈斯特再次眨了眨眼睛，更加迷糊地用一只手撑起身体。可以说是相当不稳定。

"What?" he croaked. "什么？"他嘶哑地说道。

Crowley let an arm dangle down from the bed.  
克劳利让一只手臂从床上垂下来。

"Want the whole story?" 想要听完整的故事吗？

Hastur groaned a little, exchanging views with the chameleon. In response the little creature skittered around on the pillow in a circle and made a indignant squeaking noise as Hastur slumped back into the pillow, sending him flying up an inch or two.  
哈斯特尔轻轻地呻吟了一声，与变色龙交换了一下眼神。作为回应，小动物在枕头上转了个圈，发出了愤怒的尖叫声，哈斯特尔一头栽倒在枕头上，把它吓得飞了起来一两英寸。

"Eh, didn't mean to," said Hastur, scritching the little one's snout, before he looked back at Crowley.  
“嘿，不是故意的，”哈斯特说着，用手指轻抚着小家伙的鼻子，然后又转向克劳利。

"Hit me." 打我。

Crowley went silent, the look on his face giving away that he was pondering how to start this tale the best.  
克劳利沉默了下来，他脸上的表情透露出他正在思考如何最好地开始讲述这个故事。

"Right," he began. "After what you said about that note, I went to ask Aziraphale about it."  
"对的，"他开始说道。"在你提到那张便条之后，我去问了阿兹拉菲尔关于它的事情。"

"Figures." Hastur closed his eyes and fluttered his wings a little. And looked up as alarmed as his current state allowed. He turned his head in an unnecessarily complicated manner, looking at his wings in shock.  
"真是个奇怪的事情。"哈斯图尔闭上眼睛，轻轻地扇动了一下翅膀。他抬头看着，尽管他的状态不容乐观，但还是感到惊慌。他以一种不必要地复杂的方式转动头，震惊地看着自己的翅膀。

"Oh, yeah. That," said Crowley. "Raph did an unbelievable job on the-... Hastur, are you okay?"  
“哦，是的。”克劳利说道。“拉夫在那个……哈斯特，你还好吗？”

The obvious answer seemed to be 'No'.  
显而易见的答案似乎是“不”。

Hastur had pulled himself up into a reclining position, his wings curled forward, almost wrapping himself up in them as he traced his fingers over the feathers, his frame shaking from sobs.  
哈斯特尔把自己拉起来，躺在一个斜倚的姿势上，他的翅膀向前卷曲，几乎把自己包裹在其中，他用手指轻抚着羽毛，身体因为抽泣而颤抖着。

"Hastur?" 哈斯特？

"Look at them," Hastur croaked.  
"看着他们吧，"哈斯特嘶哑地说道。

Crowley winced. He knew Hastur was immensely proud of his wings. And he had all rights to.  
克劳利皱了皱眉头。他知道哈斯特尔对自己的翅膀非常自豪。而且他有充分的理由。

They were beautiful. Crowley had always thought of them as some weird mix of flamingo and magpie wings. There were the pitch-black, shimmering primaries and secondaries of a flamingo, with star-like white spots sprinkling their coverts. But where flamingos bore reddish colours, Hastur's wings shimmered in dark iridescent blues and greens.  
它们很美丽。克劳利一直认为它们是火烈鸟和喜鹊翅膀的奇怪混合体。它们有火烈鸟那样漆黑闪亮的初级和次级飞羽，上面布满了星星般的白色斑点。但是火烈鸟是红色的，而哈斯特的翅膀闪烁着深邃的蓝色和绿色。

"Is... something wrong?" Crowley dared.  
"有...有什么问题吗？" 克劳利大胆地问道。

Hastur looked at him, the sobs becoming choked laughs.  
哈斯特尔看着他，抽泣变成了被堵住的笑声。

"They're so fuckin' beautiful," said Hastur. "I... I thought they'd never look like that again." He hastily wiped his face. "Fuck."  
“他们真他妈的美啊。”哈斯图尔说道。“我...我以为他们再也不会变成那样了。”他匆忙擦了擦脸。“该死。”

"Hey, I'm not going to tell anyone you cried."  
嘿，我不会告诉任何人你哭了。

"Shurrup." 闭嘴。

Crowley grinned. 克劳利咧嘴一笑。

"Look, I think you have all the right to get emotional 'bout that. And they _are_ pretty. Just don't winch them in yet."  
看，我觉得你完全有权利对此感到情绪化。而且它们很漂亮。只是暂时别把它们拴住。

"Still need t' heal. I figured." Hastur nodded curtly and laid back down, the chameleon clambering onto his shoulder.  
还需要疗养。我明白了。哈斯特短暂地点了点头，然后躺了回去，变色龙爬上了他的肩膀。

"Now, go on." "现在，继续吧。"

Crowley nodded, too, pondered, and picked up the story where he had left off.  
克劳利也点了点头，思考了一会儿，然后继续讲述他中断的故事。

"Aziraphale said it's his handwriting, but that he didn't write that note."  
亚齐拉费尔说这是他的笔迹，但他没有写那张便条。

Hastur snorted. And coughed heavily.  
哈斯特嗤了一声。然后重重地咳嗽起来。

"No surprise there." 毫不意外。

Crowley just glowered a little.  
克劳利只是微微皱了皱眉。

"C'mon now." 快点吧。

"Did you expect him to admit pullin' that shit."  
你指望他承认搞那种事吗？

"Well, he didn't do it." Crowley pulled himself up in what passed as a sitting position if one was generous about it, and glared.  
"嗯，他没做这件事。" 克劳利费力地坐了起来，如果对此慷慨一些的话，可以算作坐姿，并且怒视着。

Hastur glared back. 哈斯特尔怒视着对方。

"He's still an angel," he murmured. "They dun care 'bout us in the end."  
他低声说道：“他还是个天使。”“最后他们都不在乎我们。”

"Ligur's an angel too now."  
利古尔现在也成了一个天使。

Hastur sat up abruptly, the chameleon tumbling off his shoulder and landing snout first in the duvet.  
哈斯特突然坐了起来，变色龙从他的肩膀上摔了下来，头部先着地在被子上。

"Don't you dare!" Hastur snarled, before choking briefly and falling back into the pillows with a long groan.  
“你敢试试看！”哈斯特咆哮着，随后呛了一下，然后带着长长的呻吟倒在枕头上。

"Got up too fast," Crowley half-asked, half-scolded. "And... yeah... sorry. 'Tis just..."  
"起得太快了，"克劳利半问半责备道。"还有...是的...抱歉。只是..."

"Yer protective of yer angel."  
你对你的天使很保护。

"So are you..." "那你是..."

Hastur buried his face in the pillow.  
哈斯特尔把脸埋在枕头里。

"I dun have an angel."  
我没有天使。

Crowley sighed. 克劳利叹了口气。

"I know both of you hate it, but Ligur..."  
我知道你们两个都讨厌它，但是Ligur...

"Crowley, I know..." Hastur said. "And I know wot I said... I dun have an angel..." he added quietly.  
克劳利，我知道……哈斯特说道。“我知道我说过的话……我没有一个天使……”他轻声补充道。

"...oh." Crowley understood. "Hastur, I don't think..."  
“哦。”克劳利明白了。“哈斯特，我觉得……”

"Weren't you tellin' a story?"  
你不是在讲故事吗？

With a heavy sigh, and a heavier heart, Crowley looked at the older demon.  
克劳利沉重地叹了口气，心情更加沉重地望着那位年长的恶魔。

Demons don't love. 恶魔不会爱。

That's how it was, wasn't it?  
是这样的，不是吗？

Demons don't love, demons don't trust each other.  
恶魔不会爱，恶魔不会相互信任。

Crowley had figured long ago that that was a bunch of crap.  
克劳利早就明白那是一派胡言。

Sure, everyone in Hell was out to get you, backstabbing and cheating was de rigueur for a demon, and everything was dark and gloomy and... what had that guy Hastur once had to give a tour through Hell written? _Abandon all hope, ye who enter here_, or something. Aziraphale would know, most likely.  
当然，地狱里的每个人都想要陷害你，恶魔之间的背叛和欺骗是司空见惯的事情，一切都是黑暗和阴郁的...那个哈斯特尔曾经写过一本关于地狱导览的书，好像是说进入此地者必将放弃一切希望，或者类似的话。阿齐拉费尔很可能知道。

And that was the point, Crowley had found. Demons had no hope. You can't... you don't _dare_ to love or trust when you _know_ it won't end well for you.  
那就是克劳利发现的要点。恶魔们没有希望。当你知道爱情或信任不会有好结果时，你就不敢去爱或信任。

But do demons know? That was a question Crowley had asked before. To be told that _'Everyone knows that'_. So obviously no one had the slightest clue. If you tell a lie often enough...  
但是恶魔们知道吗？这是克劳利之前问过的一个问题。被告知“每个人都知道”。所以显然没有人有丝毫线索。如果你说谎的次数足够多...

They had lost Her love, sure. But that didn't have to mean they lost _all_ love. Hadn't Asmodeus fallen in love with that one human woman? Sarah? Samantha? Something like that. That miserable misadventure with Raphael? All because the old goat couldn't open his mouth and say something?  
他们失去了她的爱，没错。但这并不意味着他们失去了所有的爱。阿斯莫德斯不是也爱上了那个人类女人吗？莎拉？萨曼莎？类似这样的名字。那次可怜的冒险与拉斐尔有关？全都因为那只老山羊不会开口说些什么？

Not that he'd admit it was _love_. Wouldn't look too good on the resume of the Archdemon of Lust.  
虽然他不会承认那是爱情。对于欲望之主的履历来说，这可不太好看。

But Crowley knew better. Demons were capable of love and trust. He was the best example, and he found the thought that he'd be the only one ridiculous.  
但克劳利更清楚。恶魔也能够爱和信任。他就是最好的例子，他觉得自己会是唯一一个这样的人简直荒谬。

And Hastur? 哈斯特尔呢？

Of course Crowley had no way of telling whether or not there was anything romantic between him and Ligur (All things aside, those two had the romantic capabilities of a soggy sweater,) but there was _something_.  
当然，克劳利无法确定他和利格尔之间是否存在浪漫关系（撇开一切不谈，这两个人的浪漫能力就像一件湿漉漉的毛衣一样），但确实有某种感觉。

There was at least great care for the other.  
对他人至少有很大的关心。

But it's not something one could just ask about. Not that demons care, anyway.  
但这不是一个人随便问的事情。不过，恶魔们也不在乎。

Crowley, though, reckoned he had started caring. But he didn't dare to ask.  
然而，克劳利觉得他开始在意了。但他不敢问。

So instead he drew a deep breath and exhaled slowly.  
于是他深吸一口气，缓缓地呼出。

"Sorry." 对不起。

"Stop apologising. Yer a..."  
别再道歉了。你是个...

"Demon. I know, I know," Crowley waved Hastur off, and watched the chameleon scuttle across the bed and under Hastur's wing. "And as you pointed out, a demon telling a story." He cleared his throat.  
恶魔。我知道，我知道，"克劳利挥手打发哈斯特，看着变色龙在床上匆匆穿过，躲进哈斯特的翅膀下。"正如你所指出的，一个恶魔在讲故事。"他清了清嗓子。

"Well," he started anew, "you might like to hear that Ligur got just as upset about it, and stormed out."  
"嗯，"他重新开始说道，"你可能会喜欢听到Ligur对此也感到非常沮丧，并且气冲冲地离开了。"

"Good." Hastur scoffed. "Shame he can't..."  
"好的。"哈斯特嘲笑道。"可惜他不能..."

"Oh cut it out!" Crowley barked. "Why the fuck are you so bitter now? You were fine with all of this before."  
“别闹了！”克劳利咆哮道。“你为什么现在这么恶劣？之前你对这一切都还好好的。”

"An' then I almost died fuckin' brutally. That's enough to piss one off royally, innit?"  
然后我差点被他妈的残忍地搞死。这足以让人彻底生气了，是吧？

"I... guess." Crowley sighed heavily, picking at a feather poking out of the heavy duvet. "But..." 

He stopped when Hastur began laughing. Well, not laughing. It was more of a hiccuping giggling, a sound that Crowley was certain should not come from the older demon.  
当哈斯特尔开始笑的时候，他停了下来。嗯，并不是笑，更像是一阵打嗝般的咯咯笑声，克劳利确信这不应该是来自那个年长的恶魔的声音。

Hastur was squirming a little, giggling and snorting, fluffing and flapping his wings.  
哈斯特有点扭动，咯咯地笑着，蓬松地拍打着翅膀。

"What's so funny?" Crowley frowned darkly and displeased, sitting up proper to get a better look at things. "Oh."  
“有什么好笑的？” 克劳利皱着眉头，不悦地坐直身子，以便更好地看清楚事情。“哦。”

A green and cream spot moved between the black and iridescent blue of Hastur's wings, and Crowley snorted briefly.  
哈斯特尔的翅膀上，黑色和彩虹般的蓝色之间，一个绿色和奶油色的斑点移动着，克劳利轻轻地哼了一声。

Ligur's little buddy was obviously enjoying himself playing amongst the fresh feathers.  
利古尔的小伙伴显然在新鲜的羽毛中玩得很开心。

"You're ticklish," said Crowley, and Hastur glared at him the best the laughing tears in his eyes allowed.  
“你很怕痒。”克劳利说道，哈斯特尽力用眼中的笑泪瞪着他。

"Shurrup!" He barked, before giggling again, fingers curling into the blanket. "Oh. Get him out, will you?"  
"闭嘴！"他吠道，然后再次咯咯笑起来，手指紧握着毯子。“哦，把他弄出去，好吗？”

Crowley smiled and rose, staggering around the bed and combing through the thick and dense feathers to find the chameleon.  
克劳利微笑着站起身来，踉跄地绕过床边，梳理着浓密的羽毛，寻找变色龙。

Hastur groaned at the touch, out of breath from laughing.  
哈斯特被触碰到后呻吟了一声，因为笑得上气不接下气。

"Be more careful, will you?" he muttered.  
"你能再小心点吗？" 他嘟囔着说。

"Sorry," said Crowley, meaning it at least in the most likely case. "You have very dense wings."  
“抱歉。”克劳利说道，至少在最有可能的情况下是认真的。“你的翅膀非常浓密。”

Hastur bit back another giggle and smacked Crowley lightly with his wing.  
哈斯特抑制住另一个咯咯笑声，用翅膀轻轻地拍了拍克劳利。

Crowley simply harrumphed, ruffling some feathers. Hastur squeaked.  
克劳利只是哼了一声，搅动了一些羽毛。哈斯特吱吱地叫了起来。

"Gonna behave?" Crowley teased, and Hastur half-turned and glared.  
"要乖乖听话了吗？" 克劳利调侃道，哈斯特半转身，怒视着他。

"You taught me well," said Crowley, an honest if rather skewed smile spanning across his face before Hastur could get a word out.  
“你教得很好。”克劳利说道，他的脸上露出了一丝诚实而有些歪曲的微笑，还没等哈斯特开口。

Gently lifting the chameleon out of the feathers and putting it back down on the duvet, the smile softened as Crowley sat down.  
温柔地将变色龙从羽毛上抬起，放回被子上，克劳利坐下时微笑变得柔和了。

"And, I know, I know, demon and all but... Thank you."  
"而且，我知道，我知道，你是恶魔，但是...谢谢你。"

"What for?" Hastur groaned, and then growled lowly as Crowley began grooming his wings.  
“为什么？”哈斯特嘟囔着，然后在克劳利开始梳理他的翅膀时低声咆哮起来。

"Ligur told me. 'Bout how you put your head on the chopping block for me and all that. And it got me thinking."  
Ligur告诉我，关于你为了我而冒险的事情。这让我思考了很多。

Hastur buried his face in the pillow.  
哈斯特尔把脸埋在枕头里。

"That bloody, blessed..." the rest was an annoyed groan.  
"那该死的，又该庆幸的..." 其余的只是一声恼怒的呻吟。

"I'd just like to know why," said Crowley.  
克劳利说：“我只是想知道为什么。”

Hastur shrugged a shoulder.  
哈斯特耸了耸肩膀。

"None of yer business." 不关你的事。

"All of my business, Hastur," Crowley protested. "You pulled me from the sulphur pools and carried me to the others. You came with me to spy on the Garden, and you distracted Aziraphale. You've been around by chance about as often as I've been around Aziraphale _by chance_."  
"哈斯特，我的所有事务都是你搅和的，"克劳利抗议道。"你把我从硫磺池中拉出来，带我去见其他人。你和我一起去监视花园，分散了亚齐拉费尔的注意力。你碰巧出现的次数和我碰巧与亚齐拉费尔相处的次数差不多。"

Crowley coughed heavily. 克劳利咳嗽得很重。

"So y'admit it?" Hastur grumbled. "And get yer arse back to bed."  
"那你承认了吗？"哈斯特嘟囔着说道。"现在赶紧回床上去睡觉。"

Crowley knitted his brows.  
克劳利皱起了眉头。

"First you answer. Also, you used to call me Fledgling. Then you stopped, and now you started it again."  
首先你回答。而且，你过去常常叫我菜鸟。然后你停止了，现在又重新开始了。

Hastur growled and pulled his wings from Crowley's hands.  
哈斯特咆哮着从克劳利的手中抽回了他的翅膀。

"Get yer arse back to bed an' finish yer story."  
快点回床上，把你的故事写完。

"You tell me yours then?" asked Crowley and got up, staggering back to his own bed. Hastur said nothing.  
“你告诉我你的，好吗？”克劳利问道，然后站起身，摇摇晃晃地回到自己的床上。哈斯特尔一言不发。

"Now," Crowley began anew for the second time, "Ligur got angry and went for a walk. I got worried and followed him."  
“现在，”克劳利第二次重新开始说道，“利古尔生气了，出去散步了。我担心他，就跟着他去了。”

"Worried for him or worried for yer precious humans?"  
是为他担心还是为了你们珍贵的人类担心？

Crowley tilted his head. 克劳利歪了一下头。

"Bit of column A, bit of column B. I caught up with him at the park, we talked, and he figured that if Aziraphale made that Holy Water, it'd be listed in his miracle record."  
有点A，有点B。我在公园里追上了他，我们聊了聊，他觉得如果阿齐拉费尔制作了那瓶圣水，应该会在他的奇迹记录中有所记载。

Hastur smiled cockily. 哈斯特得意地笑了笑。

"Ligur's clever like that. 'Tis bloody rude of Her to take him away from Hell." His gaze darkened, but Crowley immediately - and weakly - raised a hand in defense.  
利古尔就是这样聪明。她把他从地狱带走，真是太可恶了。他的目光变得阴沉，但克劳利立刻无力地举起手来辩解。

"Look," he said. "I know just what you are thinking about. And... I mean 'Sorry' won't do, will it?"  
“看着我，”他说道。“我知道你在想什么。而且……我是说，‘对不起’已经不够了，对吧？”

Hastur just growled curtly.  
哈斯特尔只是咆哮了一声。

"Listen, Hastur. Had I seen any other way out... I'd have taken it."  
听着，哈斯特。如果我看到其他出路的话……我会选择它的。

"Where did y'even get that bloody stuff from? Yer angel?"  
你到底从哪儿弄来那些该死的东西？你的天使？

Crowley frowned but shook his head.  
克劳利皱了皱眉头，但摇了摇头。

"I had asked him once, but he denied me. I mean, he was worried for me. Got it during World War One... Battle of the Somme... there was that German soldier, and I was with the British troops, and he had a flask with Holy Water..."  
我曾经问过他一次，但他拒绝了我。我的意思是，他为我担心。那是在一战期间...索姆河战役...有一个德国士兵，而我当时是与英国军队在一起的，他有一个装满圣水的瓶子...

"Yer at one of the fuckin' bloodiest battles humans know and that's yer fuckin' priority?"  
你在这他妈的最血腥的战斗中，这就是你他妈的优先事项？

"Being there put things into perspective, Hastur." Crowley said dryly.  
克劳利干巴巴地说道：“在那里，一切都变得清晰了，哈斯特。”

"I know. Been there too, y'know."  
我知道。我也经历过，你懂的。

Now Crowley blinked. And glared.  
现在克劳利眨了眨眼睛。然后怒视着。

"Making the battle bloodier, right?"  
让战斗更加血腥，对吧？

"That was the intent..." Hastur picked at his primaries. "But..." he sighed. "There is a point where the misery gets unbearable..." He shook himself. "And that's sayin' a lot comin' from me."  
“那本来是我的意图……”哈斯图尔拨弄着自己的羽翼。“但是……”他叹了口气。“有一个点，痛苦变得难以忍受……”他摇了摇头。“这可是我说的很多了。”

Crowley smiled a little. 克劳利微微一笑。

"Yeah, it does..." 是的，确实...

"Congratulations on not dying there, you bloody snake."  
恭喜你在那里没有死，你这个该死的蛇。

They laid in silence for a while, the chameleon having curled up on the duvet again.  
他们静静地躺了一会儿，变色龙又蜷缩在被子上。

"But yeah...  'twas dangerous enough the get the stuff. I mean..."  
但是嗯...弄到那东西真的够危险的。我的意思是...

"Y'mean, you got it by chance." Hastur blew a raspberry. "Sure, good thinking but..."  
“你是说，你是碰巧得到的。”哈斯特发出了一声嘲笑。“当然，想法不错，但是……”

"I killed the guy. He wanted to surrender... I..." Crowley sighed heavily. "Don't tell Aziraphale, alright? That's one of the things he doesn't know."  
我杀了那个人。他想投降...我... 克劳利沉重地叹了口气。“别告诉阿齐拉费尔，好吗？这是他不知道的事情之一。”

Hastur sat up with an astonished gaze.  
哈斯特尔惊讶地坐了起来。

"Heh. Knew you gots it in you."  
嘿，知道你有这个能力。

"Pff, c'mon. Not the first time I killed."  
嘿，别闹了。这不是我第一次杀人了。

"And not the last..." "还不是最后一次..."

Crowley let out a small whine.  
克劳利发出了一声小小的呻吟。

"We've come full circle with that story then..." he said awkwardly. "Look, I..."  
"我们又回到了那个故事的起点..." 他尴尬地说道。"听着，我..."

Hastur raised a hand to stop him.  
哈斯特举起手来阻止他。

"Just finish the other one," he said, staring ahead darkly, knees pulled up to his chest.  
“把另一个完成了就行了。”他阴沉地盯着前方，双膝紧贴着胸口。

"Where was I?" Crowley wondered, looking for the thread to pick it back up out of what looked like a giant, soggy ball of yarn.  
“我在哪儿来着？”克劳利想着，试图从看起来像一个巨大、湿漉漉的毛线球中找到那根可以继续的线索。

"Miracles," said Hastur with a scolding helpfulness.  
“奇迹，”哈斯图尔责备地说道，带着一种帮助的语气。

"Ah. Yes. Right. So, Ligur figured that if Aziraphale made that stuff, it'd be listed on his file. We went back to my flat to pick up his chameleon, and as we got there, someone had broken in."  
啊，是的，对，没错。所以，利古尔认为如果阿齐拉费尔制造了那种东西，它会在他的档案中有记录。我们回到我的公寓拿他的变色龙，但当我们到达时，有人闯进去了。

"That Not-Aziraphale." 那个不是阿齐拉费尔。

"Yeah..." Crowley quirked a brow. "Hey, seems you do know his name."  
“是啊…” 克劳利挑了挑眉毛。“嘿，看来你知道他的名字。”

Hastur snorted and laid back down.  
哈斯特嗤笑一声，然后躺了回去。

"What, did he complain to you?"  
"什么，他向你抱怨了吗？"

"Matter of fact, yes." Crowley coughed again.  
事实上，是的。克劳利再次咳嗽了一声。

"You jus' told me 'twasn't him wot gave you the bloody stuff y'killed Ligur with." He shrugged. "Jury's still out on the Holy Water now, but given wot you told me jus' now..."  
“你刚才告诉我不是他给你那些该死的东西，你用来杀了利格尔的。”他耸了耸肩。“关于圣水，现在还没有定论，但根据你刚才告诉我的……”

Crowley groaned. 克劳利呻吟了一声。

"You didn't call him by his name cause..."  
你没有叫他的名字是因为...

Hastur turned to him. 哈斯特转向他。

"Yeah. An' it's been really bothering him. But now you told me what's up, I see no reason to keep doin' that. He'd want to know wot changed, though. Shame I can't tell'im, what with where you got that shit from."  
是的。这个问题一直困扰着他。但是现在你告诉我了情况，我觉得没必要再继续这样做了。不过他肯定想知道发生了什么变化。可惜我不能告诉他，因为你从哪里得到那些东西。

He smiled an a little too broad smile.  
他笑得有点过分。

"... Wanker," grumbled Crowley.  
“混蛋，”克劳利咕哝着说。

Hastur laughed, but it quickly turned into a violent cough.  
哈斯特笑了起来，但很快变成了剧烈的咳嗽。

"...We're both a mess," said Crowley, smiling bitterly.  
“我们俩都一团糟。”克劳利苦笑着说道。

"Match made in Hell, almost," said Hastur.  
“地狱中的完美组合，几乎是的。”哈斯图尔说道。

"Naw. That's you and Ligur... Sssorry." Crowley bit his tongue and dove under the duvet.  
嗯，那是你和利古尔...对不起。克劳利咬了咬舌头，钻进了被子里。

"... just finish the story, Crowley."  
“克劳利，把故事讲完就行了。”

The younger demon peeked out of his hiding place, not yet risking to come back out.  
年轻的恶魔从他的藏身之处偷偷探出头来，还不敢冒险再次出来。

"Long story short, what we found was a demon looking like Aziraphale. Tried to kill the chameleon."  
长话短说，我们发现了一个长得像阿齐拉费尔的恶魔。试图杀死变色龙。

Hastur looked at the little creature, who by now had made himself comfortable on the duvet, and the chameleon made a noise one might rather expect from a cat.  
Hastur看着那只小动物，它已经在被子上找到了舒适的位置，变色龙发出了一种更像猫的声音。

"Knocked the wanker off," Crowley continued. "He escaped through the window though. Lost a dagger on his way out... and... err... well... that's that."  
克劳利继续说道：“把那个混蛋打倒了。不过他从窗户逃走了。在逃跑的过程中丢了一把匕首……嗯……就是这样了。”

"No, go on. Tell me the embarrassing bit." Hastur grinned.  
"不，继续说吧。告诉我那尴尬的部分吧。"哈斯特咧嘴一笑。

"You're horrible." 你真可怕。

"Flattery won't get ya anywhere."  
奉承是没用的。

Crowley simply rolled his eyes.  
克劳利只是翻了个白眼。

"Fiiiine," he drawled. "Cut myself on the bloody thing. How... how was I supposed to know it's blessed."  
"好吧，"他慢吞吞地说道。"我被这该死的东西割伤了。我...我怎么知道它是受祝福的呢。"

Hastur stretched a little before making himself comfortable again.  
哈斯特伸了个懒腰，然后再次舒服地蜷缩起来。

"Yer tellin' me you ran into a demon version of yer angel and he had a fuckin' blessed knife with'im?"  
你告诉我你遇到了一个恶魔版本的你的天使，他还带着一把他妈的祝福之刀？

"You don't believe me?" 你不相信我吗？

"You look like shit, and the little one's injured. I'm buyin' this one alright." Hastur laid his hands behind his head, staring at the ceiling. "Wanker." He paused. "Y'think that's the surplus demon wot's bothering head office?"  
你看起来像个狗屎一样，小家伙受伤了。我买下这个，行吧。"哈斯特把手放在头后，盯着天花板。“混蛋。”他停了一下。“你觉得是那个多余的恶魔在困扰总部吗？”

Crowley crawled out from under the duvet again.  
克劳利再次从被子底下爬了出来。

"What?" 什么？

"Didn't I tell ya?" 我不是告诉过你吗？

"Not that I'd remember." 我不记得了。

"Hell has an extra demon an' no one can make heads or tails of it," explained Hastur. "Tasked me to keep an eye out."  
“地狱多了个恶魔，谁也搞不清楚它是个什么东西。”哈斯特尔解释道，“让我留意一下。”

Crowley whistled. 克劳利吹了个口哨。

"I seriously can't remember anything like that. But... I mean... What I saw was no demon I'd know. He smelled like Aziraphale."  
我真的记不起来有这样的事情。但是...我的意思是...我看到的不是我所认识的恶魔。他闻起来像是阿齐拉费尔。

"You smell like Aziraphale too."  
你也有亚齐拉费尔的味道。

"Low, Hastur, low." 低下，哈斯特，低下。

"What? I go out of me way an' tell the truth an' that's how you thank me?"  
什么？我费尽心思说出真相，你就这样感谢我？

Crowley went as pink as his current state allowed.  
克劳利的脸变得尽可能地粉红。

"You know that's not the case."  
你知道那不是事实。

"Pff, it's how you wankers fooled us. What did you even do? Can't be all that stickin' together. Did..."  
"呸，就是你们这些混蛋骗了我们。你们到底做了什么？不能只是一味团结在一起吧。难道..."

"No!" Crowley protested, knowing _exactly_ where this was heading. "It _is_ that sticking together. Happened over time... Just like you and Ligur smell similar under all the rot and grime."  
“不！”克劳利抗议道，他清楚地知道事情的发展方向。“就是那种黏在一起的感觉。随着时间的推移而发生的……就像你和利古尔在所有的腐烂和污垢之下闻起来很相似。”

"No rot an' grime on Ligur now."  
现在Ligur上没有腐烂和污垢了。

"He still smells like..." Crowley sniffed the nightshirt he was wearing, and raised an astronomically confused brow. "What the fudge?"  
“他还是有一股……”克劳利嗅了嗅自己穿着的睡衣，然后抬起一只极度困惑的眉毛。“什么鬼？”

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"Err, nothing." Crowley shook himself. "Anyway. That demon was definitely not someone just pretending to be Aziraphale. So... yeah. Maybe. How did we even get an extra demon?"  
“额，没什么。”克劳利摇了摇头。“无论如何。那个恶魔绝对不是假扮成阿齐拉费尔的人。所以...是的。也许。我们怎么会多了一个恶魔呢？”

"Fuck if I know," Hastur said. "Y'think there's an angel you too?"  
“我他妈的知道个屁。”哈斯图尔说。“你以为你也有个天使？”

In 6000 years and a bit Crowley had experienced his fair share of unexpected pain. Like being brought into a church when he got injured in the 15th century, or his unpleasant discorporation at the discovery of gunpowder.  
在6000多年的时间里，克劳利经历了许多意想不到的痛苦。比如在15世纪受伤后被带进教堂，或者在发现火药时不愉快地解体。

But nothing had ever hurt as much as those words.\* He whimpered, curling in on himself.  
但是从来没有什么比那些话更让他受伤了。\* 他呜咽着，蜷缩起来。

\* Aziraphale's statement about not being able to explain the feeling of Love in Tadfield, especially not to someone like _him_ silently retreated to second place of Crowley's inner ranking list  
亚齐拉费尔关于无法向塔德菲尔德的人解释爱的感觉，尤其是对像他这样的人，默默地退居克劳利内心排行榜的第二位

"What's it now?" Hastur went, before groaning loudly. "Oh for... That shite again?"  
现在怎么了？哈斯特问道，然后大声叹息道：“哦，该死...又是那个破事？”

Crowley glowered. 克劳利怒视着。

"Excuse me for being a liiiiittle bit traumatised by the whole Falling from Heaven thing."  
对不起，我对整个从天而降的事情有点小小的创伤。

"Pff, as if I'd mind _that_. It's the lamentin' 'bout seekin' Her forgiveness that pisses me off."  
哼，好像我会在意似的。真让我生气的是那些为了寻求她的原谅而叹息的事情。

Crowley turned. 克劳利转身。

"I know, I know, we're unforgivable so why even try..."  
我知道，我知道，我们是不可原谅的，所以为什么还要试着呢...

Hastur raised a hand and shook his head.  
哈斯特举起手摇了摇头。

"Not what I meant." 不是我想表达的意思。

"What else _could_ you mean?"  
你还有什么其他意思吗？

Hastur smiled wearily. 哈斯特疲倦地微笑着。

"That's the big difference between you an' I, Crowley. Yer hopin' for Her forgiveness. I'm waiting for Her to ask mine."  
这就是你和我之间的巨大区别，克劳利。你希望她原谅你，而我在等待她向我道歉。

Crowley just shook his head bewildered.  
克劳利只是困惑地摇了摇头。

"What?" 什么？

"You an' so many others are all about gettin' the ol' hag to forgive them. Demons an' humans alike. But y'know... that's the thing. What did we do wrong? She's _God_, for fuck's sake. She made us like we are. You, me, Lucifer. Ev'ryone. An' She knew wot would happen, wot wi' the whole all-knowy-ness. She bloody well punished us for Her own fuckin' shortcomings."  
你和许多人都在努力让那个老婆婆原谅他们。不管是恶魔还是人类。但你知道吗...问题就在这里。我们做错了什么？她可是上帝，该死的。她让我们变成现在这个样子。你、我、路西法，每个人都是。而她知道会发生什么，因为她全知全能。可她却为了她自己的缺点而惩罚了我们。

Hastur looked like he was in urgent want for a cigarette.  
哈斯特看起来急需一支香烟。

"What?" said Crowley instead.  
“什么？”克劳利反问道。

"What I said. She made everyone so they'd do what they did. And then She punished us for bein' who we are. We owe Her bloody well nothing."  
我说的话。她让每个人都做他们所做的事情。然后她因为我们是我们自己而惩罚我们。我们可一点儿都不欠她。

"I..." "我..."

"Never looked at it that way, eh? Tell you what, Fledgling. She owes each and every being ever, an' 'specially us demons one big apology an' all that. Not the other way roun'. Least if She's really all-knowing an' isn't just bullshitting Her way through life like everyone else."  
从来没这么看过，嗯？听着，新手。她欠每一个存在，尤其是我们这些恶魔一个大大的道歉，还有其他的方式。至少如果她真的无所不知，而不只是像其他人一样在生活中胡扯。

Crowley pondered this. 克劳利陷入了沉思。

"She's God. She can't just do away with the all-knowy-ness."  
她是神。她不能随随便便放弃全知全能。

"She's _God_. She should be very well able to."  
她是上帝。她应该非常有能力。

Crowley pondered this as well.  
克劳利也在思考这个问题。

"Well that... That's not a wrong thought. Pretty clever, actually."  
嗯，那个... 这个想法并不错。相当聪明，实际上。

"Don't act so surprised, pal. I say a lot of clever shit. You jus' never stay 'round long 'nough to hear it."  
别那么惊讶，伙计。我说了很多聪明的话。只是你从来没待够时间听到而已。

They laid in silence for a bit, Hastur staring at the ceiling, occasionally scratching his neck, while Crowley had rolled to his stomach, dangling an arm down the side of the bed and tracing a finger over the floorboard.  
他们静静地躺着，哈斯图尔盯着天花板，偶尔挠挠脖子，而克劳利则翻身趴在床上，一只手悬在床边，用手指在地板上轻轻划过。

"Doesn't make much sense, does it?" Crowley said ultimately.  
克劳利最终说道：“这没什么意义，对吧？”

"What does?" "这是什么意思？"

"I mean... this demon would explain the surplus thing. But... how did he know 'bout that guy we're supposed to drag to Hell?  
我是说...这个恶魔会解释那个多余的事情。但是...他怎么知道我们要把那个人拖到地狱去？

"Beats me. Maybe he spied on us?" Hastur turned his head. "An' we still don't know where the guy got the Holy Water from."  
不知道。也许他监视了我们？"哈斯图尔转过头。“而且我们还不知道那家伙从哪里弄到圣水的。”

Crowley nodded grimly. 克劳利沉重地点了点头。

"Not my Aziraphale. I vouch for that."  
不是我的阿齐拉费尔。我为此担保。

"Whatever." 随便。

"But what now?" 现在怎么办？

"We sleep. We both been put through the wrangler an' we need it."  
我们睡觉。我们俩都经历了一番折腾，需要好好休息一下。

Crowley blinked. Something about this didn't sound right to him.  
克劳利眨了眨眼睛。对于这件事情，他感觉有些不对劲。

"Shouldn't we tell Hell?"  
我们不应该告诉地狱吗？

Hastur snorted. 哈斯特嗤笑了一声。

"Since when are you so bloody eager to please'm?"  
你从什么时候开始这么他妈的热衷于讨好人了？

There it was. 就在那里。

"Since when are you so disobedient?"  
你什么时候变得这么不听话了？

Hastur smiled crookedly. 哈斯特微微一笑。

"Told you. Since they tried to do away wi' me piece by piece. And then made me a bloody angel's nanny. I dun take kindly to that."  
告诉过你了。自从他们试图一点一点地摆脱我，然后让我成为一个该死的天使保姆。我对此可不感冒。

"You're on a vendetta?" 你在报复吗？

"I'm being pissed off an' tired," Hastur said in a tone illustrating exactly that. "Laugh if you have to, but I'll be taking you as 'xample and fly over the radio."  
“我被气烦了，又累得要命。”哈斯特尔语气中充满了这种情绪。“你要笑就笑吧，但我会以你为例子，通过广播传达出去。”

Crowley drew breath to correct the phrase, but decided against it.  
克劳利吸了口气，本想纠正那句话，但最终决定不这么做。

"So," he said in a distinct not-trying-to-change-the-topic tone, "I told my story. What's yours?"  
“那么，”他以一种明显不想改变话题的语气说道，“我讲完了我的故事。轮到你了。”

"My story? I'm tired of yer babbling, that's me story."  
我的故事？我受够了你的唠叨，那就是我的故事。

With a more than frustrated groan Crowley sat up, regretting the decision immediately. He gave a hacking cough before falling back into the pillow, a hand pressed over his mouth.  
克劳利沮丧地发出一声叹息，勉强坐了起来，立刻后悔了。他咳嗽了几声，然后又倒回枕头上，一只手捂住嘴巴。

"See. Told you we needs it," Hastur teased. "An' before you complain. There's nothing to me story. I rebelled, I fell, pulled ya out of the pool 'cause I thought we might need all the people we can get."  
看吧，我就告诉你我们需要它了，"哈斯特调侃道。"还没开始抱怨呢。这个故事没什么好说的。我叛逆了，我跌落了，把你从水池里拉出来，因为我觉得我们可能需要尽可能多的人。"

For some odd reason Crowley was... disappointed to hear that. And disbelieving too.  
由于某种奇怪的原因，克劳利听到这个消息感到失望。而且他也不相信。

You wouldn't call me Fledgling then, he thought. But he rose, and staggered for the door.  
他想，你不会再叫我新手了。但他站起身，蹒跚着走向门口。

"Where you goin'?" asked Hastur, more annoyed than interested.  
"你去哪儿？" 哈斯特问道，更多的是烦恼而不是感兴趣。

"Gonna call Hell, get this out of the way."  
打个电话给地狱，把这事解决了。

Crowley heard the annoyed grunt, and pulled the door shut behind him.  
克劳利听到了不悦的咕哝声，然后关上了门。

Downstairs was quiet, with only the occasional rustle of pages.  
楼下很安静，只偶尔传来纸页翻动的声音。

"Aziraphale?" Crowley peeked around in the shop, finding Aziraphale reading as he had expected. The angel looked up alarmed.  
"阿齐拉费尔？" 克劳利在店里四处张望，发现阿齐拉费尔正在读书，正如他所预料的那样。天使惊慌地抬起头。

"You go back to bed this instant." Aziraphale whacked his finger. "Look at yourself. You're more unsteady on your feet than usual."  
"你立刻回去睡觉。"亚齐拉费尔狠狠地敲了敲手指。“看看你自己，比平常更站不稳。”

Crowley sighed. 克劳利叹了口气。

"I appreciate your concern, angel," said Crowley and coughed, getting an equally scolding and concerned sigh out of Aziraphale. "I just need to contact Hell for a moment. Where's the others?"  
“谢谢你的关心，天使。”克劳利说着咳嗽了一声，阿齐拉费尔也发出了一声责备和关切的叹息。“我只是需要联系地狱一下。其他人在哪里？”

Aziraphale pointed up. 亚齐拉费尔指了指上方。

"Headed to Heaven to check for things. You and Hastur were fast asleep. Umm, how are you?"  
去天堂看看有什么事情。你和哈斯特都在熟睡。嗯，你好吗？

"Feeling like I've been ran over by a parade of steamrollers, thanks for asking." Crowley slumped down in a chair and looked up at the angel, who had begun putting books away. "I'm trying to make sense of all of this."  
感觉就像被一队蒸汽压路机碾过一样，谢谢关心。克劳利无精打采地坐在椅子上，抬头看着正在整理书籍的天使。“我正在努力理清这一切。”

Aziraphale sighed once more. "So am I."  
亚齐拉费尔又叹了口气。“我也是。”

"Aziraphale?" "阿齐拉费尔？"

"Yes?" "是吗？"

"I mean I saw a demon that looked and smelled like you."  
我的意思是，我看到一个长得和你一样，闻起来也像你的恶魔。

The angel winced. 天使皱了皱眉。

"And," Crowley went on, in a softer tone. "Do you think there's an angel me out there too? I mean, with what you saw and all?"  
“而且，”克劳利以柔和的语调继续说道，“你觉得还有一个像我这样的天使存在吗？我的意思是，根据你所见的一切？”

Aziraphale shook his head.  
亚齐拉费尔摇了摇头。

"You shouldn't worry about that, dear. Not now."  
亲爱的，你不必担心那个。现在不是时候。

"Azi-" Crowley began to protest.  
"阿兹-" 克劳利开始抗议。

"I mean because you are not, ah, back on track."  
我是说因为你现在不在正轨上。

Crowley cocked his head. There was something odd going on and he couldn't pinpoint it.  
克劳利歪了歪头。有些奇怪的事情正在发生，他无法准确找出原因。

"I believe," said Aziraphale, "contacting Hell cannot wait?"  
“我相信，”亚齐拉费尔说道，“联系地狱不能再等了？”

"You know Hell." 你知道地狱。

"I know you rarely cared."  
我知道你很少在意。

Crowley laughed curtly. 克劳利冷笑了一声。

"Ah, I dunno. After all what happened the past week..."  
啊，我不知道。毕竟过去一周发生了那么多事情...

"I know what you mean." Aziraphale pulled up another chair. "Are you alright?"  
"我知道你的意思。"亚齐拉费尔拉了一把椅子过来。“你还好吗？”

"Aside from what I already said? No." Crowley sighted and kicked his legs a little. "This is... I mean I went through the fourteenth century..."  
除了我已经说过的之外？没有了。”克劳利叹了口气，有点踢腿。“这是……我的意思是，我经历了十四世纪……”

"Raphael says you still owe her dinner from back then."  
拉斐尔说你还欠她一顿晚餐。

"..." went Crowley. "You angels and your priorities." He brightened nevertheless. "I'll see to that. But... it's just all a bit much right now."  
“…” 克劳利说道，“你们天使们和你们的优先事项。”尽管如此，他还是变得开心起来。“我会处理的。但是……现在一切都有点太多了。”

Aziraphale nodded sympathetically.  
亚齐拉费尔同情地点了点头。

"Hey!" Someone called, and Crowley and Aziraphale turned to see Hastur leaning against a shelf nearby. Crowley rolled his eyes.  
“嘿！”有人喊道，克劳利和阿齐拉费尔转过头，看到哈斯特靠在附近的书架上。克劳利翻了个白眼。

"Didn't you say you were going to sleep?"  
你不是说你要去睡觉吗？

"Didn't you say you was gonna contact Hell?"  
你不是说你要联系地狱吗？

Crowley rolled his eyes harder. And Aziraphale mirrored it.  
克劳利更加翻了个白眼，阿齐拉费尔也模仿了他。

"Mind to tell me why you are naked?" sniffed the angel.  
"能告诉我为什么你一丝不挂吗？" 天使嗅了嗅。

Hastur looked down at himself as if the fact hadn't yet occured to him.  
哈斯特尔低头看着自己，仿佛这个事实还没有意识到他。

"'Cause I'm not wearing clothes?" he said.  
他说：“因为我没穿衣服？”

Aziraphale bristled. 亚齐拉费尔愤怒地竖起了毛。

"There could have been customers here!"  
这里本来可以有客人的！

"What, during a time o' day that'd make for reasonable opening hours? Anyway. I talked t' Dagon."  
在一个合理的营业时间内，你在做什么？不管怎样，我和达贡谈了谈。

"Huh?" said Crowley, getting up from his seat.  
“嗯？”克劳利说着，从座位上站了起来。

"Got a li'l radio upstairs." Hastur nodded vaguely towards the ceiling. "Wanna hear a joke?"  
楼上有个小收音机。”哈斯特朝天花板随意点了点头。“想听个笑话吗？”

"You hate jokes," said Crowley and Aziraphale in unison.  
“你讨厌笑话。”克劳利和阿齐拉费尔异口同声说道。

"Aye. An' especially this one. Told Dagon 'bout the new demon. And then 'bout how we'll need more time to get that human." Hastur frowned and crossed his arms. "Guess what Dagon said."  
嗯，尤其是这个。告诉达贡有关那个新恶魔的事。然后又说我们需要更多时间来抓住那个人类。哈斯特皱了皱眉，双臂交叉在胸前。“猜猜达贡说了什么。”

"Tell," said Crowley, frowning as well.  
“说吧。”克劳利皱起了眉头。

"That you," Hastur whacked a finger at the younger demon, "delivered him days ago."  
“就是你，”哈斯特指着年轻的恶魔，说道，“几天前把他送来的。”

### Chapter Text 章节正文

**~⧖~**

"So, yeah. It's not much a flavor, really." Warlock scratched his nose and drummed his heels against the low wall he was sitting on.  
嗯，是的。其实，这个味道并不怎么样。术士挠了挠鼻子，双脚敲击着他坐在的低墙。

"Tsk," went Pepper. "嘁," Pepper 嘀咕道。

She had spotted the new kid on her way home and, in lack of both company and anything better to do, had gone over to say Hello. The fact that the newcomer was American had naturally laser-guided the discussion to ice cream.  
她在回家的路上注意到了那个新来的孩子，由于缺乏伴侣和更好的事情可做，她走过去打招呼。新来的孩子是美国人这个事实自然而然地将讨论的话题引导到了冰淇淋上。

"Shame, really," Pepper continued, turning the information that not even chocolate tasted like chocolate in America over in her head.  
"真是可惜啊，"佩珀继续说道，她脑海中回想起连巧克力都不像巧克力那样好吃的美国的信息。

"Yeah." "是的。"

"So, you're movin' here with your Mum?"  
"那么，你跟你妈妈一起搬来这里了？"

Warlock blew a raspberry.  
术士吹了个呸。

"Dunno. Not really my kind of place. But Mom's been draggin' me from one place to the next, and I'm _so_ sick of it. But, man, it'd be totally weird to move here."  
不知道。不是我喜欢的地方。但是妈妈一直把我从一个地方拖到另一个地方，我真的受够了。但是，哥们，要是搬到这里来，那真的太奇怪了。

"Why?" 为什么？

"You know..." 你知道的...

He was cut off by his mother calling him.  
他被他妈妈的电话打断了。

"Eesh," said Warlock. "I better get going. Guess there'll be no movin' here then."  
“唉，”Warlock说道。“我最好走了。看来这里是不会有什么动静了。”

He jumped off the low wall. Pepper couldn't tell if he looked disappointed or relieved. He slouched past Pepper and turned to say Bye.  
他从低矮的墙上跳了下来。Pepper无法确定他是失望还是松了一口气。他低头走过Pepper，转身说了声再见。

"Be seein' ya, maybe," he said. "And I was born here. That's why it's weird."  
他说：“或许再见了。”“而且我是在这里出生的。所以这很奇怪。”

**~⧖~**

There were few things that Crowley was absolutely and unshakable convinced of:  
克劳利确信的事情很少，而且他对这些事情坚定不移

1.  He deserved some sort of medal for the invention of Scripted Reality TV formats.  
    他因为发明了真人秀电视节目的剧本格式而应该得到某种奖章。
2.  Some hitherto unknown third party had invented peacocks.  
    一些迄今未知的第三方发明了孔雀。
3.  The current situation could not get worse.  
    目前的情况已经无法再糟糕了。
4.  He would get in so much trouble for this.  
    他会因此惹上大麻烦。

It might have cheered him up to know that he had gotten two of these correct.  
也许让他高兴的是，他答对了其中两个。

"This won't do," concluded Crowley gloomily, balancing a vintage-going-antique  radio on his knees.  
克劳利沮丧地下结论道：“这样不行。”他将一台古董收音机平衡在膝盖上。

That was one of the issues he had with Aziraphale's little shop and the adjacent living quarters: the utmost lack of anything he could use to contact Hell.  
这是他对亚齐拉费尔的小店和隔壁的住所之一的问题：他完全没有任何可以用来联系地狱的东西。

Not just because the angel was, well, an angel.  
不仅仅因为那个天使是个天使。

The main part of the problem was that, ever since Crowley had convinced Hell to use electronics for communication, the number of potential ways to contact Hell from the bookshop had theoretically dwindled down to one:  
问题的主要部分是，自从克劳利说服地狱使用电子设备进行通信以来，从书店联系地狱的潜在方式理论上已经减少到了一种：

Aziraphale's vintage computer.  
亚齐拉费尔的复古电脑。

And Crowley had quickly found that his options had dwindled down to zero on account of Aziraphale's most unfortunate tendency to bless things as some sort of subconscious thing akin to sticking out one's tongue when concentrating. Including the computer.  
克劳利很快发现，由于阿齐拉费尔有一种非常不幸的倾向，就是将事物祝福，就像专注时伸出舌头一样，他的选择已经减少到零。包括电脑。

Which made the existence of the radio such a big surprise.  
这使得收音机的存在成为一个巨大的惊喜。

Almost as big as the surprise of learning that it had been Hastur who had restored it.  
几乎和得知是哈斯特恢复了它一样令人惊讶的是，它的规模也相当庞大。

With the _How-To-Make-Contact_ question out of the way, the one left was _How-To-Explain-To-Hell-That-There's-Apparently-An-Angel-Crowley-Running-Around_. Crowley would never openly admit it, but he was grateful that Hastur hadn't spilled the beans on that yet.  
在解决了如何联系的问题之后，剩下的一个问题是如何向地狱解释，似乎有一个名叫克劳利的天使四处奔波。克劳利永远不会公开承认，但他感激哈斯特还没有泄露这个秘密。

"Why?" asked Hastur casually while picking feathers from the pillow. "'S'not every day that this kinda thing happens, innit?"  
“为什么？”哈斯特随意地问道，一边从枕头上拔下羽毛。“这种事情可不是每天都发生的，是吧？”

Crowley groaned. 克劳利呻吟了一声。

"We don't even know how this... whatever he is managed that."  
我们甚至不知道这个...他是怎么做到的。

"Oh, that's easy," said Hastur. "If there's an angel-you an' a demon-Aziraphale they pulled the same stunt as you an' your angel."  
“哦，那很简单，”哈斯特尔说道。“如果有一个天使——你和一个恶魔——阿齐拉费尔和你的天使玩了同样的把戏。”

Crowley didn't miss the cranky tone which was a significantly different kind than Hastur's usual crankiness. He wisely chose not to acknowledge it.  
克劳利察觉到了那种不同于哈斯特常见的脾气暴躁的语气，他明智地选择不予理会。

"They swapped bodies after killing someone? What for?"  
他们杀了一个人后交换了身体？为了什么？

Hastur gave the audible equivalent of a shrug.  
哈斯特发出了一个听得见的耸肩声。

"Beats me." 我不知道。

Crowley just shook his head.  
克劳利只是摇了摇头。

"This won't do." 这样不行。

YOU SAID AS MUCH. 你说了一样多。

Crowley made an undignified squeaking noise and nearly dropped the radio as Dagon's voice replaced the white noise from the speaker.  
克劳利发出了一个不太体面的尖叫声，几乎把收音机掉在地上，当达贡的声音取代了扬声器中的白噪声时。

Hastur chuckled quietly. 哈斯特尔轻轻地笑了笑。

"Have you been listening in the entire time?"  
你一直在听吗？

YES. HASTUR'S IDEA. 是的。哈斯特的想法。

Hastur flashed Crowley a too broad smile. Crowley looked oddly heartbroken.  
哈斯特向克劳利露出了一个过于宽广的微笑。克劳利看起来异常心碎。

CARDS ON THE TABLE. THIS WOULD EXPLAIN THE SURPLUS DEMON.  
摊牌吧。这会解释多余的恶魔。

"Naturally," agreed Crowley, helpfully. "So what now?"  
"当然," 克劳利乐意地表示同意。"那么现在怎么办？"

SAME AS BEFORE. Y'KEEPS AN EYE OPEN.  
和之前一样。你要保持警惕。

"Naturally," agreed Crowley, reluctantly.  
"当然," 克劳利勉强地同意了。

AH, AN' CROWLEY? THIS WILL OF COURSE BE SCRATCHED FROM YER ACCOMPLISHMENT LIST.  
啊，还有克劳利？这当然会从你的成就清单上被划掉。

"... Naturally," agreed Crowley, begrudgingly.  
“当然，”克劳利勉强地同意了。

There was a static hush and hum as Hell ceased broadcasting, and Crowley carefully put the radio to the side, switching it off.  
地狱停止广播时，静电声和嗡嗡声消失了，克劳利小心地把收音机放到一边，关掉了它。

"Any plans?" he asked, crawling back under the duvet.  
"有什么计划吗？"他问道，蜷缩回被子下。

Hastur cast him a scrutinizing glance. There was something in his gaze that made Crowley momentarily certain that the older demon was about to make a snide remark.  
哈斯特尔投以他一瞥。他的目光中有一种东西让克劳利瞬间确信，这位年长的恶魔即将说出一句讽刺的话。

Had Crowley held onto that thought it would have been another musing he would have been correct about.  
如果克劳利坚持那个想法，那将是另一个他正确的思考。

"Lay back an' get better," said Hastur. "Won't be any use if we keel over."  
“躺下来好好休息，”哈斯图尔说道。“如果我们倒下了，就没有任何用处了。”

Crowley had to admit this was sensible. He was still dizzy and mildly nauseous, and his head felt like it was a few sizes to small for all the thoughts and worries that were squirming and squishing through it, like the tube at rush hour.  
克劳利不得不承认这是明智的。他仍然感到头晕和轻微恶心，他的头部感觉就像是为了那些蠕动和挤压而在思绪和担忧中变得太小了，就像高峰时段的地铁车厢。

In over 6000 years he had seen a lot. Good, bad, weird.  
在6000多年的时间里，他见过很多事情。好的，坏的，奇怪的。

The images that stayed with him the most - much to his dismay - where the 14th century and what he saw upon Falling. And if he was honest with himself, he couldn't say what had been worse. Well, he could make some sort of sense of the 14th century though. What he saw upon Falling...  
他记忆最深刻的画面——令他感到不安的是14世纪的景象以及他在坠落时所见到的景象。如果他对自己诚实，他无法说哪个更糟糕。不过，他对14世纪的景象还能够有些理解。而他在坠落时所见到的……

It was just confusing, to say the least.  
这真的令人困惑，至少可以这么说。

And this situation now felt similar.  
而现在的情况感觉相似。

"How d'ye think that's possible?" he asked, ultimately.  
他最终问道：“你觉得这可能吗？”

Hastur cracked an eye open at him.  
哈斯特尔睁开一只眼睛看着他。

"Not like that, wot with you babbling the whole time."  
不是那样的，你整天啰嗦个不停。

It took Crowley a moment to make sense of that. Then he sighed heavily.  
克劳利花了一会儿才弄明白。然后他沉重地叹了口气。

"Not what I meant. I... how _can_ there be, y'know... a _Me_ who..."  
不是我想表达的意思。我...怎么可能有，你懂的...一个像我这样的人...

He suddenly found himself unable to say it. Maybe it was because of him remembering Falling just now, maybe it was something else, but he couldn't get himself to muse out loud about a him who didn't Fall.  
他突然发现自己无法说出来。也许是因为他刚刚想起了坠落，也许是其他原因，但他无法大声思考一个没有坠落的他。

And he couldn't muse even quietly about an Aziraphale that did.  
他甚至不能安静地思考一下一个会这样做的阿齐拉费尔。

"Fuck me if I'd know," grunted Hastur, and fell into a thoughtful silence.  
“要是我知道就去他妈的吧。”哈斯特嘟囔着，陷入了沉思的寂静中。

"Do you think that this is the only world what exists?"  
你觉得这是唯一存在的世界吗？

Crowley frowned lowly. 克劳利皱了皱眉。

"Hastur, you know whether or not there are other inhabitable pla-" He sat up incredibly slowly. "You're not talking about alien planets. You're talking different realities."  
哈斯特，你知道是否还有其他适宜居住的星球吗？"他慢慢地坐了起来。“你不是在谈论外星球，你是在谈论不同的现实。”

"What's to it?" 有什么事吗？

"I... err..." "我... 呃..."

Hastur groaned in a way that showed he knew just exactly what Crowley had been thinking. He had gotten used to that reaction.  
哈斯特发出了一声呻吟，表明他清楚地知道克劳利刚才在想什么。他已经习惯了这种反应。

"Different question then. Do you think She really has some bloody plan?"  
那就换个问题。你觉得她真的有什么血腥计划吗？

Crowley pondered. 克劳利陷入沉思。

"Didn't we talk about this?"  
我们不是已经谈过这个了吗？

"Could be. Could not be. Anyway. Do you think She's actually got a plan."  
可能是，也可能不是。不管怎样。你觉得她真的有计划吗？

"The bloody Ineffable one, sure. Why?"  
血腥的无法言喻的存在，当然。为什么？

"I think Ma's bullshittin' Her way through life like everyone else."  
我觉得马女士就像其他人一样，用胡扯的方式过着生活。

Crowley just stared. 克劳利只是盯着看。

"But She's God." "但她是上帝。"

"So? Tell you what we talked about. Why the whole getting booted from Heaven is some sort o' high-quality shit. An' that She owes ev'ryone an apology. But tell you what. Thinkin' 'bout that gots me thinkin'.  
那么？告诉你我们谈论的是什么。为什么被从天堂赶出来是一种高品质的狗屎。而且她欠每个人一个道歉。但是告诉你吧。想着这个让我想到了一些事情。

Ma has an utter shite sense of humor, an' people like that hate getting bored. And y'know how everyone's all 'God knows everything'. Doesn't go with having a plan, does it?"  
马的幽默感真是糟糕透顶，像他这样的人最讨厌无聊。而且你知道大家都说“上帝无所不知”吗？这可不符合有计划的想法，对吧？

Crowley stared again. 克劳利再次凝视着。

He hated to admit it, but it made some sense. Though he very much doubted its possibility.  
他不愿承认，但这说得有些道理。尽管他非常怀疑它的可能性。

Sometimes his imagination was worse than that of the average demon.  
有时候，他的想象力比普通恶魔还要糟糕。

"If I was almighty an' all-knowing," Hastur went on, "I'd do away wi' the all-knowy-ness an' just pretend I have a plan. I mean, remember Her kid and that fig tree. Guy gets sloshed, curses the tree and next mornin's all 'I totally meant to do that'. He didn't get that from his other mum."  
"如果我是全能的，无所不知的，"哈斯特继续说道，"我会摒弃无所不知的能力，只是假装我有一个计划。我的意思是，记得她的孩子和那棵无花果树。那个家伙喝醉了，咒骂了那棵树，第二天早上却说'我完全是有意为之'。这不是他从他的另一个妈妈那里学来的。"

Crowley couldn't argue that. He had been there. And he was certain he had spoiled all chances of being let back back into Heaven he might have had by laughing there and then.  
克劳利无法反驳这一点。他曾经在那里。他确信自己因为当时的笑声而彻底失去了重返天堂的机会。

"Fair," he said. "And you think those... other two come from a different timeline?"  
"公平," 他说道。"你认为那两个...其他的人来自不同的时间线？"

"Sounds right to me." 听起来对我来说没问题。

Crowley laid back again and thought about that.  
克劳利再次躺下来，思考着这个问题。

"But why would God let that happen? And how?"  
"但是为什么上帝会允许那种事情发生呢？又是如何发生的呢？"

"Shits and giggles. And I said She turned off the all-knowy-ness, not the other things."  
开玩笑而已。我说她关闭了全知全能，而不是其他的东西。

"I think it's nonsense. For my money those two are just part of some scheme to make us pay. Dunno how they got the smell right, but I say they are just agents of someone up to something that spells trouble for us."  
我觉得这是胡扯。我认为这两个人只是某种让我们付钱的阴谋的一部分。不知道他们是怎么搞对了那个味道的，但我说他们只是某个人的代理人，搞些对我们来说麻烦的事情。

Hastur looked at him coldly.  
哈斯特冷冷地看着他。

And shrugged. 然后耸了耸肩。

"If you say so. And now sleep, or are all me ideas not good 'nough for you?"  
如果你这么说的话。现在去睡觉，难道我的想法都不够好吗？

He rolled to his side, his back to Crowley, and cocooned himself in his wings.  
他侧身滚动，背对着克劳利，然后用翅膀将自己包裹起来。

"Hastur, I didn't mean..."  
哈斯特，我不是故意的...

"Sleep, Crowley, just sleep."  
睡吧，克劳利，安心入眠。

Crowley quietly rolled onto his back, pulled the duvet up, and tried to make sense of things.  
克劳利悄悄地翻身躺在床上，拉起被子，试图理清思绪。

**~⧖~**

"That is _not_ what I gave it to you for!" cried Keruvael, flinging an already broken vase from the equally broken counter at Phelan.  
"这不是我给你的目的！" Keruvael 大喊着，将已经破碎的花瓶从同样破损的柜台上扔向 Phelan。

Who dodged it easily, throwing back a glare.  
谁轻松地躲开了，瞪了回去。

"I told you, I had no choice. And what did you think I would need Holy Water for?"  
我告诉过你，我别无选择。你以为我会需要圣水做什么？

Keruvael was seething. 克鲁瓦尔愤怒不已。

"Medicine. Wards. Something... something else!"  
医学。病房。还有什么...还有其他的东西！

Phelan groaned. 菲兰叹了口气。

"And you think I could do any of that without you?"  
"你觉得我能在没有你的情况下完成这一切吗？"

"We had agreed not to harm them!"  
我们曾经约定不伤害他们！

"That was before the..." 那是在之前的事情了...

"_That_ is even more reason to tell them."  
这更是告诉他们的理由。

"So you decided to risk everything we achieved up till now, to..."  
所以你决定冒着我们迄今为止取得的一切风险，去...

Keruvael snorted humorlessly.  
克鲁瓦尔不悦地哼了一声。

"Why are we even doing this still?" he snarled. "We gained nothing from that plan. And you nearly killed an innocent!" He crossed his arms defiantly.  
"我们为什么还要继续做这件事？"他咆哮道。"我们从那个计划中一无所获。而且你差点杀了一个无辜的人！"他挺起胸膛，双臂交叉。

"There are no innocent demons," hissed Phelan darkly. "Your own words, angel."  
"没有无辜的恶魔，"费兰阴沉地嘶吼道。"这是你自己的话，天使。"

"In our world, yes. Here? We don't know."  
在我们的世界里，是的。但在这里呢？我们不知道。

Phelan blew a raspberry. 菲兰吹了个呸。

"This 'Crowley' did start the Spanish Inquisition. How different can this Hell be if another You does better... worse... you know what I mean, than I did?"  
这个“克劳利”确实发起了西班牙宗教裁判所。如果另一个你做得更好...或者更糟...你知道我是什么意思，那么这个地狱会有多不同呢？

Keruvael sneered. 克鲁瓦尔冷笑了一声。

"What if he also just got a commendation 'cause Hell thought he did do that? 'Tis what happened to you."  
要是他也只是因为地狱认为他做了那件事而得到表彰呢？这就是发生在你身上的事情。

Another raspberry followed.  
又来了一颗树莓。

"Oh, what are the chances, angel? Really now?"  
哦，天使，这有多大的机会呢？真的吗？

Keruvael fell silent for a moment.  
克鲁瓦尔沉默了片刻。

"Oh, I dunno," he then sneered. "About the same as us spending this new life in a ruined house worse than what we had in our world?"  
"哦，我不知道，"他嘲笑道。"和我们在这个比我们在原来的世界里更糟糕的破败房子里度过这个新生活差不多吧？"

"We are not spending our new life in a ruin..."  
我们并没有把我们的新生活过在一片废墟中...

Keruvael gestured at everything in general.  
克鲁瓦尔向周围的一切做了个手势。

"...forever," Phelan drawled. "Just for the time being."  
“……永远的，”费兰慢吞吞地说道。“只是暂时而已。”

"The time being, my foot. Do you really believe that nonsense about us vanishing if we'd get in contact with them?"  
现在的时间，才不是呢。你真的相信那些关于我们与他们接触就会消失的胡言乱语吗？

Phelan's gaze darkened again.  
菲兰的目光再次变得阴沉。

"As a matter of fact, I do."  
事实上，我确实这样认为。

Keruvael frowned. 克鲁瓦尔皱了皱眉。

And turned towards the door.  
并转向门口。

"Where are you going?" Phelan hollered.  
"你去哪儿？" 菲兰大声喊道。

"I'm telling them." 我告诉他们。

With a howl Phelan lunged forward and grabbed his arm.  
菲兰发出一声嚎叫，向前扑去，抓住了他的胳膊。

"No!" 不！

"And why not?" 为什么不呢？

"Because I _do_ believe that we'll vanish!"  
因为我确实相信我们会消失！

Keruvael paused. 克鲁瓦尔停下了脚步。

"Why? 'Cause someone who has some beef with them said so?"  
为什么？因为有人跟他们有点儿矛盾就这么说了？

"He's ought to know, right?"  
他应该知道，对吧？

"Why?" 为什么？

Phelan let go of Keruvael's arm upon that.  
菲兰松开了克鲁瓦尔的手臂。

"Why else would he help us, right?"  
他要不然为什么会帮助我们呢，对吧？

Keruvael cocked his head. That had sounded weird.  
克鲁瓦尔歪了一下头。那听起来有点奇怪。

"Some weird revenge plan maybe?"  
一些奇怪的报复计划吗？

Phelan simply pouted. 菲兰只是撅了撅嘴。

"Which would look like what exactly? He has more resources than we could ever acquire..."  
那会是什么样子呢？他拥有的资源比我们能够获得的要多得多...

"... as long as we are staying in a ruin."  
只要我们待在一座废墟里。

Phelan harrumphed. 菲兰哼了一声。

"I'm just saying, sure, he has got a bone or two to pick with them..."  
我只是说，当然，他对他们有一两个骨头要挑...

"Whole skeleton, more like."  
整个骨架，更像是这样。

Phelan sighed inwardly. 菲兰心里叹了口气。

"He has got some beef with them, but it surely isn't enough to lead to such an obscure and convoluted revenge plan. As I mentioned, with all his resources there is just no need to be... sneaky."  
他和他们有些矛盾，但这绝对不足以导致如此晦涩复杂的报复计划。正如我所提到的，凭借他所有的资源，根本没有必要耍手段。

Keruvael cocked his head the other way, and slouched to the small couch.  
克鲁瓦尔将头歪向另一边，懒散地躺在小沙发上。

"Tell that to Edmont Dantes, why don't you?" he said grimly.  
他阴沉地说道：“你为什么不去告诉埃德蒙·唐泰斯呢？”

**~⧖~**

"Penny for yer thoughts," said Ligur as he stepped next to Uriel on a small balcony overlooking one of the new, similarly small courtyards.  
“给你一分钱的想法。”Ligur说着，他走到乌列尔身边，站在一个俯瞰着其中一个新建的小庭院的小阳台上。

"Why would you care?" Uriel responded darkly, simply staring ahead.  
"你为什么会在意呢？"乌里尔阴沉地回答，只是直视前方。

"'Cause I think we're both tryin' to make sense of this."  
因为我觉得我们都在试图弄清楚这个。

The last hour or so had been a mess. As if what had happened with Hastur hadn't been upsetting enough, the situation in Heaven had turned out to be no better.  
过去的一个小时左右一团糟。好像哈斯特尔发生的事情还不够让人心烦意乱，天堂的情况也变得一团糟。

"It's none of your business," said Uriel, still not looking at him.  
乌里尔不看他，说道：“这不关你的事。”

"Oh, I dunno. This will likely affect Earth, and what wi' me now bein' of Heaven's field agents... " Ligur continued, leaned onto the banister, and grinned.  
"哦，我不知道。这很可能会影响地球，而我现在是天堂的特工..." 利古尔继续说着，倚在栏杆上咧嘴一笑。

"You're enjoying being a menace, are you not?" Uriel grumbled, finally glaring at him from the corner of her eyes.  
"你很享受做恶作剧，是吗？"乌里尔咕哝着，最终从眼角瞪视着他。

"Been a demon me whole bloody life and never did nothing to be Forgiven. An' why should I? The Almighty draggin' me back up here for a lark won't change who I am." He grinned. "Said it yerself, you did. 'M not one of yours an' nevermore will be."  
我这辈子都是个恶魔，从来没有做过什么需要被原谅的事情。我为什么要原谅自己呢？全能者把我拽回来只是为了开个玩笑，不会改变我是谁。"他咧嘴一笑。“你自己说过，我不是你们中的一员，以后也永远不会是了。”

Uriel eyed him scrutinisingly.  
乌里尔目光严厉地盯着他。

"You didn't come here to throw my words back at me, so out with it: Why are you here?"  
你不是来这里跟我争辩的，所以直说吧：你为什么来这里？

"It's what I said. I'm trying to make sense of what's going on."  
就是我说的。我在试图弄清楚发生了什么。

Uriel wrinkled her nose in displeasure.  
乌里尔不满地皱了皱鼻子。

"Someone managed to break into Heaven's Vault, stole various powerful artefacts and then Gabriel knocked Sandalphon out and fled Heaven. That is what's going on."  
有人设法闯入天堂的宝库，偷走了各种强大的神器，然后加百列击晕了桑达尔芬并逃离了天堂。这就是发生的事情。

"When y'say 'fled' you make it sound as if you do think Gabriels guilty. And I know y'dun do that."  
当你说“逃跑”时，你让它听起来好像你认为加布里埃尔有罪。而我知道你不会那样做。

Uriel harrumphed. 乌里尔哼了一声。

"You are correct about that."  
你说得对。

"But yer using Sandalphon's words. Don't you think it's odd that he used 'fled'?"  
“可你在引用桑达尔冯的话。你觉得他用‘逃离’这个词是不是有点奇怪？”

With brows furrowed and a snarl on her lips, Uriel turned away again.  
乌里尔皱着眉头，嘴角挤出一丝咆哮，再次转身离开。

"You wondered that too," said Ligur, triumphantly. "Admit it. And you wonder more 'bout Sandalphon talking about Gabriel that w-"  
"你也曾想过这个问题，"利古尔得意地说道。"承认吧。而且你对桑达尔冯谈论加百列那个-"

"Don't you try sowing dissent, demon," Uriel hissed, nose to nose with Ligur now.  
"你可别试图挑拨离间，恶魔，"乌列尔嘶声道，与利古尔鼻尖贴在一起。

"Dominion, Archangel. Dominion." Ligur grinned gleefully. "Look, again. I share yer intent to make sense of this. Sure, maybe Sandalphon didn't mean anything by that wording. As y'said and as I said: I'm a demon. Maybe not by creed anymore, but by heart. I know better than any bloody angel how words work."  
主宰，大天使。主宰。"利古尔愉快地咧嘴笑道。"看，再看。我和你一样，都想弄清楚这个意思。当然，或许桑达尔芬并没有特别的意思。就像你说的，也像我说的：我是个恶魔。或许不再是出于信仰，但是出于内心。我比任何该死的天使更懂得言辞的妙用。"

Most of them, anyway, Ligur thought. 'S'long as they're in a language I know.  
大部分，无论如何，利古尔心想。只要是我懂的语言就行。

"Ev'ryone who heard Sandalphon speak about things like that might as well go an' think Gabriel's behind that bit of thievery."  
每个听到桑达尔冯谈论这种事情的人都可以认为加百列在那次盗窃中起了作用。

At least this got Uriel out of his face and to grimace.  
至少这让乌里尔不再面露难色，而是扭曲了一下脸。

"They won't. He's the Archangel Gabriel."  
他们不会。他是大天使加百列。

"An' you an' Michael an' ev'ryone wot saw Gabriel after the discovery says he was acting mighty odd. I have ears, Uriel." Ligur took a deep breath. "If it's any help, I _do_ agree with you an' Michael on this."  
“你、迈克尔和每个看到加百列发现后的人都说他的行为非常奇怪。我有耳朵，乌列。”利古尔深吸了一口气。“如果有帮助的话，我同意你和迈克尔的观点。”

"It's quite some mess we got 'ere, yer right 'bout that," said a third voice, and Uriel and Ligur turned.  
“这可是个相当混乱的局面，你说得没错，”第三个声音说道，乌里尔和利古尔转过身来。

"Raphael," acknowledged Uriel. "How's Sandalphon?"  
"拉斐尔，"乌列尔承认道。"桑达尔芬怎么样了？"

"Got quite a bump on the noggin but he'll be fine."  
他的脑袋撞得挺厉害，但他会没事的。

"Did he say anythin' to clear things up?" said Ligur.  
"他有没有说什么来澄清事情？" 里格尔说道。

"Naw. Went on about how worried he is, and that Gabriel knocked him out after they spoke 'bout how few people can even open the bloody vault."  
嗯，他继续说他有多么担心，还说加布里埃尔在他们谈论有多少人能打开那该死的金库之后把他打晕了。

"Guess he went on lamenting 'bout how _impossible_ it is that Gabriel would do something like that," Ligur snarked.  
猜他继续抱怨加百列不可能做那种事情，利古尔讽刺地说道。

"You sound as if you think Sandalphon did it," Uriel snarked back.  
"你听起来好像认为桑达尔芬干的那样,"乌列尔嘲讽地回答道。

Ligur just shrugged and opened his mouth to respond.  
利古尔耸了耸肩，张开嘴巴准备回答。

"Stop sowing dissent for a moment, will you?" Raphael cut him off.  
"停止挑拨离间一会儿，好吗？"拉斐尔打断他。

Again Ligur just shrugged.  
利古尔再次耸了耸肩。

"'M Not trying. But I _do_ think Sandalphon's choice of words an' all that is odd what with him presum'bly not believing Gabriel did this."  
我不是在努力。但我确实觉得桑达尔冯选择的措辞有点奇怪，因为他应该不相信加百列做了这件事。

"But?" asked Raphael in a tone so undoubtingly accusatory that it would have made even your average First World government admit to how many hands they had in the latest elections in a sudden burst of deeply frightened conscience.  
“但是？”拉斐尔问道，语气如此毫不怀疑地指责，以至于即使是你们平凡的第一世界政府，在一阵深深恐惧的良心爆发中，也会承认他们在最近的选举中有多少插手。

"But be it as it is," said Ligur gloomily, suddenly very serious. "Heaven's facing a problem that's impossible t'ave happened. Too few people to even open the vault, and one o' them left Heaven in a hurry."  
“但不管怎样，”利古尔沮丧地说道，突然变得非常认真。“天堂面临着一个不可能发生的问题。人数太少，甚至无法打开保险库，而其中一个人匆匆离开了天堂。”

Uriel and Raphael nodded curtly.  
乌里尔和拉斐尔轻轻点了点头。

All things considered it wasn't looking too well for Gabriel.  
综合考虑，对于加布里埃尔来说情况并不太好。

"But why?" said Uriel, drumming her fingers onto the banister. "I mean, let's assume it was Gabriel or Sandalphon. Why would they do that?"  
“为什么？”乌列尔边敲着手指边说道，“我是说，假设是加百列或桑达尔芬干的，他们为什么要这么做呢？”

The other two shrugged. 另外两个耸了耸肩。

"Yer guess' as good as mine," said Raphael flatly. "I'm more on the 'When', meself. I mean, no one ever checks on the vault these days, what wi' none of us really roaming Earth mingling wi' humans or going to Hell to bail someone out anymore."  
拉斐尔平淡地说：“你的猜测和我的一样好。我更关心的是‘何时’。我的意思是，现在没有人再去检查保险库了，我们中没有人真正在地球上与人类交往或去地狱帮助别人脱困。”

Ligur and Uriel nodded morosely.  
利古尔和乌里尔黯然点头。

"Those days were fun," said Uriel, and Ligur grumbled agreeingly, kicking at the ground.  
"那些日子真好玩，"Uriel说道，Ligur不满地附和着，一边踢着地面。

Raphael paused, then nodded.  
拉斐尔停顿了一下，然后点了点头。

"So ev'ryone could of dunnit," she said, looking down at the courtyard.  
她低头看着庭院，说道：“所以每个人都可能做到。”

"Cards on the table," said Uriel. "Do you think Gabriel did it?"  
"摊牌吧，"乌里尔说道。"你认为加百列做了这件事吗？"

Raphael was silent. 拉斐尔沉默不语。

"No," she finally said, very slowly. "I expected he'd snap one o' these days, but still..."  
“不，”她最终慢慢地说道。“我预料他总有一天会发飙，但还是……”

Uriel blinked. 乌里尔眨了眨眼睛。

"What do you mean by that?"  
你是什么意思？

Raphael shrugged. 拉斐尔耸了耸肩。

"I shouldn't give this away as a doctor, but Gabriel..."  
"作为一名医生，我不应该泄露这个，但是加布里埃尔..."

"He's in London," came a fourth, urgent voice.  
"他在伦敦," 第四个急促的声音传来。

The trio looked to find Michael standing there, looking rather dishevelled.  
三人看到迈克尔站在那里，看起来相当凌乱。

"Is he now?" said Uriel.  
"他现在是吗？" Uriel说道。

"Briefest spike in energy," Michael explained, wringing her hands.  
迈克尔握着双手解释道：“能量的短暂激增。”

The others looked at her with concern.  
其他人带着关切的目光看着她。

"What happened?" Ligur finally voiced what everyone wanted to ask. But Michael shook her head.  
发生了什么事？利古尔终于说出了大家都想问的问题。但是迈克尔摇了摇头。

"I dunno. He miracled something but..."  
我不知道。他神奇地做了些什么，但是...

"Did you check his file?" said Uriel, and Michael's face fell.  
"你查过他的档案了吗？" Uriel 问道，迈克尔的脸色一下子变得沮丧起来。

"I... no. I forgot about that."  
我...不，我忘了那件事。

Uriel stepped over, laying a gentle hand on Michael's arm.  
乌里尔走过去，轻轻地把手放在迈克尔的胳膊上。

"It's alright. You're all rattled."  
没关系。你们都吓坏了。

Michael nodded softly. 迈克尔轻轻点了点头。

"Well," Ligur intoned, stretching a little in a way that very obviously was meant to mask the concerns he still had, "we still gotta check Aziraphale's file, dun we?"  
“嗯，”利古尔低声说道，稍微伸了个懒腰，明显是为了掩饰他仍然存在的担忧，“我们还得检查一下阿齐拉费尔的档案，不是吗？”

"Yes," Raphael stood up straight and turned towards the corridor. "Best not to dally any longer."  
“是的，”拉斐尔挺直身子，转向走廊。“最好不要再耽搁了。”

Now, it had been a good plan that would have certainly cleared some things up...  
现在，这原本是一个很好的计划，肯定能解决一些问题...

Had it accounted for the most unfortunate circumstance that both files had gone missing.  
假设最不幸的情况是两个文件都不见了。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Let us, for a moment, revisit the previous statement made about the structure and look of Hell.  
让我们暂时回顾一下之前关于地狱的结构和外观的陈述。

It's true that very few humans have ever had what could be called a 'good idea' of what Hell looks like, and those that have come closest usually cheated: Milton had gotten his input from a demon, Dante, who, as mentioned, had gotten a guided tour of the Nine Circles\*, and Blake had made an absurdly good guess.\*\*  
很少有人真正了解地狱的样貌，那些最接近真相的人通常都是作弊的：弥尔顿从一个恶魔那里得到了灵感，但丹特则亲身参观了九层地狱，而布莱克则做出了一个荒谬却准确的猜测。  
\-  
\* Naturally, in best biographer and tourist guide tradition, they've both been anything but objective. Milton's ideas of what sells thus got stacked on top of a demon trying to kiss up to the boss, and Dante was really at a loss as to what to make of that almost frustratingly polite angel that had gotten him and Virgil entrance into Dis.  
自然地，按照最好的传记作者和导游的传统，他们两个都远非客观。米尔顿的销售理念因此被堆叠在一个试图巴结老板的恶魔之上，但但丁对那个几乎令人沮丧地彬彬有礼的天使感到困惑，这个天使让他和维吉尔得以进入地狱。

\*\* A guess, admittedly, helped rather substantially by the passionate theological ramblings of a friend (an almost frustratingly polite bookseller) living a few streets from Blake's house in Soho.  
承认地说，这个猜测在很大程度上得到了一位热情的神学爱好者朋友（一个极其有礼貌但有点令人沮丧的书商）的帮助，他住在布莱克在索霍区的家附近的几条街上。  
\-  
No one, however, ever mentions the maintenance shafts.  
然而，没有人提到维护通道。

  
The maintenance shafts were one of the things that never changed, no matter how much Hell got shifted and turned upside-down and around, making them a usually reliable structure to traverse the Nine Circles. Usually.  
维护通道是那些从未改变的事物之一，无论地狱如何变动和颠倒，它们始终是穿越九层地狱的可靠结构。通常情况下。

"I'm at F4-12 again, and nothing." Legion noted, exasperated. He had been climbing up and down the rickety ladder running along the narrow shaft several times now, looking for just where the Here the trinkets Leviathan kept finding (and which Mammon consequently kept taking away) could even have come from.  
"我又回到了F4-12，什么都没有。”莱吉恩沮丧地说道。他已经多次爬上爬下沿着狭窄通道的摇摇欲坠的梯子，寻找利维坦一直找到的小玩意儿（而马门则一直拿走）到底是从哪里来的。

"Right, come back up then."  
好的，那就回来吧。

Asmodeus was sitting in his office, several floor plans of Hell rolled out in front of him, another copy of Legion sitting on the edge of the desk, relaying information. It was certainly more advantageous than fiddling with walkie-talkies.  
阿斯莫德坐在办公室里，地狱的几个楼层平面图展开在他面前，另一份军团的副本放在桌子边缘，传递信息。这绝对比摆弄对讲机更有优势。

"Right." Legion frowned. Normally he avoided the maintenance shafts like anything if he could help it. They creeped him out, and Legion being Legion that was saying a lot.   
"好的。" 莱吉恩皱了皱眉头。通常情况下，如果有可能，他会尽量避开维修通道。那些地方让他感到毛骨悚然，而对于莱吉恩这样的人来说，这可不是一句轻描淡写的话。

One, because no one could really tell where they even came from. Some demons speculated they must be the impact sites of those that Fell first, but there wasn't anyone who could say for certain if those holes hadn't been there even before.\*\*\*  
首先，因为没有人能够确定它们到底是从哪里来的。一些恶魔猜测它们可能是那些最早堕落的恶魔的撞击点，但没有人能够确定那些洞穴在之前是否就存在。  
\-  
\*\*\* When you are barreling towards the ground at a speed of Soditall the scenery (besides the immediate point of impact) isn't really the thing you're paying attention to.  
当你以Soditall的速度朝地面冲下去时，除了即将撞击的地方，你并不真正关注周围的风景。  
\-  
Two, it was a place to get lost quite thoroughly. Even though the shafts were strictly vertical and the tubes and other passages lead from one maintenance shaft to the next or out onto one of Hell's floors, it was still a strange and convoluted system. Some of the shafts were abnormally deep, seeming to go down much further than Hell itself\*\*\*\*. Legion had once lost a copy jumping down one of the shafts to see how deep it goes. Mind you, he didn't lose the copy because of the impact with the bottom, but because after roughly two days he had simply lost contact.  
二，这是一个非常容易迷失的地方。尽管通道严格垂直，管道和其他通道连接着一个维护通道到下一个或者通向地狱的地板，但这仍然是一个奇怪而复杂的系统。一些通道异常深，似乎比地狱本身还要深得多。军团曾经有一次跳下其中一个通道，想看看有多深。请注意，他失去了联系并不是因为撞到了底部，而是在大约两天后，他简单地失去了联系。

And three, they were just a little too dark for even a demon to see without help. For quite some time simply miracling up a light source had been the go-to, but some of the walls began sparking when such light came near them.\*\*\*\*\* Torches (the fire kind) were as much a good idea in Hell as they are in such confined spaces on Earth, so that hadn't been a great time either. Then humans had gone and invented storm lanterns, which were safe to use and extremely stylish, and later they discovered that one of the many uses of electricity was to make light, resulting in the invention of torches (the electric kind).  
而且，它们对于恶魔来说，即使是借助帮助也有点太暗了。相当长一段时间里，创造光源是唯一的解决办法，但是当这样的光靠近墙壁时，有些墙壁开始发出火花。\*\*\*\*\*火炬（火焰那种）在地狱里和在地球上这样狭小的空间里一样是个好主意，所以那也不是个好时机。然后人类发明了风暴灯，既安全又时尚，后来他们发现电的一个众多用途之一就是发光，于是发明了电筒（电动那种）。  
\-  
\*\*\*\* Yes,_including_ the Bottomless Pit. Make of that whatever you want.  
\*\*\*\* 是的，包括无底洞。你可以随意理解。  
\*\*\*\*\* Which, to Legion, was another half-reason to not like the shafts.  
对军团来说，这又是一个不喜欢这些轴的半个原因。  
\-  
"Shafts G through J don't run anywhere near any pools," Asmodeus said, tracing a finger over the plans. He was getting frustrated with this. Not his usual kind of 'getting frustrated with something' which usually was more of a getting bored with mundanity of things. No, this was pure, good old fashioned frustration over a riddle that didn't seem to have an answer. Also a riddle that forced him to work closely with Leviathan.  
阿斯莫德斯在图纸上划过一根手指，说道：“G到J号轴根本不靠近任何游泳池。”他对此感到非常沮丧。这不是他通常那种对事物平凡乏味感到厌烦的沮丧，而是对一个看似没有答案的谜题感到纯粹、老式的沮丧。而且这个谜题还迫使他与利维坦密切合作，这更加令他感到沮丧。

Confidentially speaking he didn't mind the other Archdemon, as long as they stayed far away from him. Asmodeus really didn't like fish.  
说实话，他并不介意其他大恶魔，只要他们离他远一点就行。阿斯莫德真的不喜欢吃鱼。

"So unless Leviathan is after all right — which I dearly hope he's not, I would never get to hear the end of that — and those blasted baubles just appear out of thin air, you should..."  
所以，除非利维坦最终是对的——我真心希望他不是——否则我将永远听不到最后的结局——那些该死的小玩意儿不会突然凭空出现，你应该...

Asmodeus was cut off by Legion muttering blessings.  
阿斯莫德被军团的祝福声打断了。

"Something amiss?" 有什么不对劲吗？

Legion looked up sheepishly.  
军团羞怯地抬起头。

"I dropped the torch. Thought I heard something, and..."  
我把手电筒掉了。觉得听到了什么声音，然后...

Now _Legion_ was cut off by himself suddenly falling off the desk, writhing in pain, holding his chest, coughing, and looking quite alarmed.  
此刻，军团突然从桌子上摔了下来，痛苦地扭动着，捂着胸口，咳嗽着，神情相当惊恐。

"Oh, that's gonna leave a mark," he croaked, squirming to sit up.  
"哦，那会留下痕迹的，"他嘶哑地说着，挣扎着坐了起来。

"What in the bloody Choirs was that?" Asmodeus managed, seriously shocked.  
“那是什么鬼东西？”阿斯莫德严肃地震惊地说道。

"Short version, sir? We got a rather trigger-happy angel in Hell."  
先生，简短版的话？地狱里有一个相当喜欢扣动扳机的天使。

~⧖~

The Problem, Keruvael figured, was that, at the end of the day, Phelan was a demon. And if Keruvael had learned one thing about this world, then that the local demons where just as infuriating as the once he was used to. Granted, at the line at the bottom or something they were better, which was a strange thing to say, and Phelan would very gladly hold a speech about why it's extremely rude to say something like that, but, all things considered, they were better, but in terms of being a never-ending well of frustration they were the same.  
问题在于，Keruvael 想到，归根结底，Phelan 是个恶魔。而且，如果 Keruvael 对这个世界有什么认识的话，那就是当地的恶魔和他习惯的那些一样令人恼火。当然，在某种程度上，他们在底线上要好一些，这是个奇怪的说法，Phelan 很愿意发表一篇关于为什么说这样的话极其无礼的演讲，但是，综合考虑，他们确实更好，但是在无尽的挫折感方面，他们是一样的。

Phelan had left after their fight a little earlier to clear his head, and Keruvael had been left alone with his own thoughts. And he was starting to get a headache.  
菲兰在他们的争吵之后稍早离开了，为了冷静一下。克鲁瓦尔被留在了自己的思绪中。而且他开始头疼起来。

He was pacing up and down in the little room (after sweeping up the broken vase, even though he just dumped the shards into a corner where they wouldn't be in the way), his mind spinning around the same thought like a far too loud record.  
他在小房间里来回踱步（扫完碎花瓶后，他只是把碎片倒在一个不碍事的角落），他的思绪像一张声音太大的唱片一样围绕着同一个念头旋转。

Alright, so, Phelan believed their mysterious benefactor enough to try and kill their counterparts. Which was bad enough. Especially since, the more Keruvael turned the information over in his head, the more loose piece came falling out. Sure, there _was_ a chance that guy was truthful and that Keruvael and Phelan would just go **_poof_** if they were to actually meet their counterparts proper. But why and how would that not apply to any other way this Aziraphale and this Crowley would learn about them? If they were anything like him and Phelan, then they ought to have figured things out by now. Keruvael had nearly ran into the other angel at the market, and Phelan had nearly _crashed_ into the other demon's car.\*\*\*\*\*\*  
好的，所以费兰相信他们神秘的恩人，足以试图杀死他们的对应者。这已经够糟糕了。特别是当克鲁瓦尔越想越觉得这个信息有问题时，更多的碎片开始掉落。当然，有可能那个人说的是真的，如果克鲁瓦尔和费兰真的遇到他们的对应者，他们可能会消失无踪。但是为什么其他方式，比如这个阿齐拉费尔和克劳利得知他们的事情，不会产生同样的效果呢？如果他们和克鲁瓦尔和费兰一样，他们应该早就弄清楚了。克鲁瓦尔几乎在市场上撞到了另一个天使，费兰几乎撞到了另一个恶魔的车。  
\-  
\*\*\*\*\*\* Which, to Phelan, was an even more aggravating thought than ceasing to exist.  
对菲兰来说，这个想法比停止存在更加令人恼火。  
\-  
And, by all means, Phelan ought to have figured something's fishy as well. He's no fool. Stubborn as one, but...  
而且，无论如何，菲兰也应该意识到有些事情不对劲。他可不是傻瓜。固执倒是有点像，但是...

Keruvael let out a howl and yanked his jacket from the couch, rummaging the broken cupboard for pencil and paper.  
克鲁瓦尔发出一声嚎叫，从沙发上抓起他的夹克，翻找着破碎的橱柜，找到了铅笔和纸。

This would all be so much easier if Phelan would just _tell_ him what that guy had told him out of Keruvael's earshot that had convinced Phelan. But all Keruvael would get out of his friend when he asked was a haunted look he'd seen on the demon's face often enough to know things were dire and serious. Which left Keruvael with only one choice on how to tackle all of this:  
如果费兰能告诉他那个家伙在凯鲁瓦尔听不见的地方告诉他的那些话，让费兰相信了，那一切都会变得容易得多。但是每当凯鲁瓦尔问他的朋友时，他只能看到一个鬼魅般的表情，他已经多次在恶魔的脸上见过这种表情，知道事情变得严重和紧急。这让凯鲁瓦尔只有一个选择来处理这一切：

Do something incredibly stupid.  
做一些非常愚蠢的事情。

"Right, that's cool," Adam sniffled, nevertheless excited, leaning on the window sill looking down. "The new kid, I mean, not the horsepeople being back."  
"没错，挺酷的，"亚当抽了抽鼻子，仍然兴奋地倚在窗台上往下看着。“我是说新来的孩子，不是那些骑马的人回来了。”

"Figured as much," Pepper called up. With all that had happened today, she reckoned it'd only be fair to let Adam know what was going on straight away. "You think he'll actually move here?"  
"我早就猜到了，"佩珀打电话过去。考虑到今天发生的一切，她觉得立刻让亚当知道发生了什么是公平的。"你觉得他会真的搬到这里吗？"

Adam shrugged, turned away to sneeze and turned back to Pepper.  
亚当耸了耸肩，转过身去打了个喷嚏，然后又转回来看着佩珀。

"Guess we gotta wait and see. But 'bout the horsepeople. Any idea what they're up to?"  
猜我们得等着看。但是关于那些马人，你有什么想法？他们在搞什么鬼？

Pepper shook her head. 佩珀摇了摇头。

"No. But it's gotta have something to do with the old manor, that where I ran into War."  
没有。但肯定与那座老庄园有关，那是我遇到战争的地方。

Adam drummed his fingers on the window sill, thinking. Then he coughed and groaned. Thinking in this state wasn't easy.  
亚当在窗台上轻轻敲打着手指，思考着。然后他咳嗽了一声，发出了呻吟声。在这种状态下思考并不容易。

"Ya really oughta get back to bed," Pepper called up. "You go get better, I'll keep an eye an' an ear open. Can't have'm trying to end the world again."  
"你真应该回去睡觉了，"佩珀喊道。"你去好好休息，我会保持警觉。不能让他们再试图毁灭世界了。"

Adam gave her a thumbs up and closed the window, crawling back into bed.  
亚当向她竖起大拇指，关上窗户，爬回床上。

"You think," Adam addressed Dog, who was curled up in his bed under the desk, "it's them what feels so odd in town right now?"  
"你觉得," 亚当对着蜷缩在桌子下床上的狗说道，"是不是他们让镇上感觉如此奇怪？"

Dog raised his head, barking once, but it wasn't anywhere near a 'yes'-bark.  
狗抬起头，汪了一声，但这声音并不像是肯定的汪汪声。

"Yeah, me neither," said Adam, furrowing his brow. "There's somethin' else. But it's really bad that _they_ are here now."  
“是啊，我也是这样想的。”亚当皱起了眉头说道。“还有其他的事情。但现在他们在这里真的很糟糕。”

Dog barked again. This time it was a 'yes'.  
狗又叫了一声。这次是一个“是”的回答。

Adam grumbled. Why did he have to get sick now out of all times? There was so much going on right now, and little of it felt good. Worse yet, Adam felt like there was a thought at the back of his head trying desperately through wade through the cold-caused mud and fog in his brain.  
亚当抱怨着。为什么他偏偏在这个时候生病了呢？现在有这么多事情要处理，但几乎没有一件让他感觉好的。更糟糕的是，亚当感觉脑后有一个念头在努力穿越因感冒而引起的脑袋里的泥泞和雾气。

The best thing he could do, he figured, was rest and get well, and hope things would not get weirder before he was back on his feet again.  
他心想，他能做的最好的事情就是休息好，养好身体，希望在他恢复健康之前事情不会变得更奇怪。

~⧖~

Aziraphale was brooding. Which was, considerably, worse than him dithering. Brooding meant he was focused to the point of getting tunnel vision.  
亚齐拉费尔陷入了沉思。这比他犹豫不决要糟糕得多。沉思意味着他专注到了只看到一个点的地步。

He was sitting on his desk, the surface covered in tomes written in languages long lost to humans, if they even ever knew them.  
他坐在桌前，桌面上堆满了用人类早已失传的语言写成的书籍，如果他们曾经知道的话。

There had to be a simple, comprehensible explanation for this. Whoever that demon that looked like him was, they had to have come from somewhere. But Aziraphale was at a complete loss as to where.  
这一定有一个简单易懂的解释。不管那个看起来像他的恶魔是谁，他们一定是从某个地方来的。但是阿齐拉费尔完全不知道是从哪里来的。

A strange hiccup in time and space due to Adam resetting the world possibly while Crowley and Aziraphale had swapped bodies had sounded like a good explanation, but neither did the text support it even remotely, nor did it make a satisfying amount of sense.  
由于亚当重置了世界，可能在克劳利和阿齐拉费尔交换身体时，时间和空间出现了一个奇怪的打嗝，这听起来是一个很好的解释，但是无论是文本本身还是它所表达的意思都无法支持这个解释，也无法给人以满意的理解。

Crowley had briefly peeked downstairs to inform the angel of the possibility that this demon him might had come from another reality, which sure, was a potential explanation, but one that raised as many new questions as all the others. And concentrating on just one was hard enough due to the pure and simple fact that there being a demon that looked like him made Aziraphale's stomach turn.  
克劳利曾短暂地往楼下看了一眼，告诉天使有可能这个恶魔是来自另一个现实的，这确实是一个潜在的解释，但也引发了许多新问题。而且集中精力只解决其中一个问题已经够难的了，因为有一个长得像他的恶魔让阿齐拉费尔感到恶心。

Now, humans had long since mused about multiple realities, about time-travel and such concepts. Even the Heavenly Host had speculated in hushed tones about this, but, try as he wanted, Aziraphale couldn't find any clue to it in the texts either.  
现在，人类早已对多重现实、时间旅行等概念进行了长时间的思考。即使是天堂的众神也曾私下猜测过这些事情，但是，尽管亚齐拉费尔想尽办法，他在文本中也找不到任何线索。

It was just frustrating. Enough to have Aziraphale wonder _if_ he should take this matter up with head office, all things considered.  
这真是令人沮丧。让亚齐拉费尔不禁开始考虑是否应该就此事向总部提出申诉，综合考虑一切。

But for now he needed a break. He leaned back and rubbed his face with a groan, stretched, winced, and looked at the clock.  
但是现在他需要休息一下。他向后靠在椅子上，咕哝着揉了揉脸，伸了个懒腰，略微皱了皱眉，然后看了看钟表。

Oh dear. 哎呀。

He still had so much to do for Miss Bolton's visit. At least most of it could only be done once the supermarket's open again, but before that there was cleaning up the shop. In a way that allowed for an easy messing it up again to not make potential customers get too comfortable in the shop. Some things mustn't be done half-hearted.  
他还有很多事情要为Bolton小姐的访问做准备。至少大部分事情只能在超市重新开放后才能完成，但在那之前需要清理店铺。以一种方式进行清理，以便随时可以再次弄乱，以免让潜在顾客在店内过于舒适。有些事情不能半途而废。

Another stretch and Aziraphale rose, just as someone nearby cleared their throat. Aziraphale's expression grew sour, but he turned with a strained smile.  
又伸了个懒腰，亚齐拉费尔站了起来，就在这时，附近有人清了清嗓子。亚齐拉费尔的表情变得不悦，但他勉强笑了笑，转过身去。

"Sandalphon, what brings you here at this hour?"  
桑达尔芬，这个时候你来这里有什么事？

"I need to speak to you." Sandalphon wrinkled his nose. "Your little abode is smelling worse and worse every time that I visit."  
"我需要和你谈谈。”Sandalphon皱了皱鼻子。“每次我来访，你的小住所的气味都越来越糟糕。”

You could stop visiting, y'know, Aziraphale thought, but kept his smile.  
阿兹拉菲尔心想，你可以停止访问了，但他保持着微笑。

"That might be on some of the tomes," he waved a hand at the desk. The higher angel quirked a brow.  
“那可能在一些书上，”他挥了挥手指指向桌子。高级天使皱了皱眉。

"I was talking about the stench of evil, but I reckon that is on your chaperone."  
我在谈论邪恶的气味，但我想这是你的监护人的责任。

"Who is setting up a room for himself upstairs, yes."  
谁在楼上给自己布置房间，是的。

"But, mind you, it reeks even more dire than just a..."  
"但是，注意，它的情况比仅仅是...更加严重。"

"Oh, Crowley is upstairs catching up with some of his quota. Belphegorian demon, you understand. Much higher threshold when it comes to sloth, curiously enough."  
哦，克劳利在楼上赶一些他的任务。贝尔菲戈尔恶魔，你懂的。懒惰方面的门槛要高得多，有趣的是。

Sandalphon looked displeased.  
桑达尔芬看起来不高兴。

"And you let him work on such quota in your house?"  
"你就让他在你家里做这样的任务量吗？"

"All in the spirit of charity." Aziraphale shrugged.  
“都是出于慈善之心。”亚齐拉费尔耸了耸肩。

This was met with an unamused harrumph.  
这引起了一个不悦的哼声。

"You ought to get your priorities in order." Sandalphon eyed the tomes. "Quite some ancient texts you are studying."  
你应该把你的优先事项整理好。Sandalphon注视着那些古老的文献说道：“你正在研究一些相当古老的文本。”

"Refresher courses, really," said Aziraphale, in a discernible It's-not-lying-if-I-don't-like-you tone (which Sandalphon didn't catch), moving all too slightly to stand in Sandalphon's way. "Now, albeit you might take joy in it, I doubt you came here to lecture me on how to do my duty. What is it?"  
“真的只是进修课程而已。”亚齐拉费尔以一种明显的“如果我不喜欢你，那就不算撒谎”的语气说道（桑达尔芬并没有察觉到），微微移动身体，挡住了桑达尔芬的去路。“现在，虽然你可能对此感到高兴，但我怀疑你来这里并不是为了给我上一堂关于履行职责的讲座。有什么事？”

Another harrumph, a scrutinizing glare, and another harrumph.  
又一声咕哝，一道挑剔的目光，再一声咕哝。

"I am looking for Gabriel, has he come by, by chance?"  
我在找加布里埃尔，他碰巧来过吗？

Aziraphale furrowed his brow.  
亚齐拉费尔皱起了眉头。

"No. Why?" 不。为什么？

"Oh, it's quite a miserable and distressing little tale, but I reckon I ought to tell you." So Sandalphon did. Aziraphale's gaze got darker.  
哦，这是一个相当悲惨和令人痛苦的小故事，但我想我应该告诉你。”于是桑达尔芬讲述了。亚齐拉费尔的目光变得更加阴暗。

"You make it sound as if Gabriel...," he began.  
"你说得好像加布里埃尔..."他开始说道。

"Oh, goodness, no. I would _never_! But it is really concerning, is it not? We can count on you telling us should you see him? Or better, tell me directly, the others have equally pressing problems on their hands I, however, cannot disclose."  
哦，天哪，不行。我绝对不会这样做！但这真的令人担忧，不是吗？我们可以指望你告诉我们，如果你见到他的话？或者更好的是，直接告诉我，其他人手头同样有紧迫的问题，但我不能透露。

"I will, of course." 当然，我会的。

"Good." 好的。

And Sandalphon was gone. 桑达尔冯消失了。

Aziraphale frowned, pondering the new information. This was bad news. Really bad news. And... something certainly reeked, and it wasn't his shop.  
亚齐拉费尔皱了皱眉头，思考着这个新的信息。这是个坏消息。真的是个坏消息。而且...某件事肯定很臭，而那不是他的店里散发的味道。

~⧖~

"I hope you had any luck," Michael greeted as she and Uriel met up on Trafalgar.  
"希望你有好运，" 迈克尔在特拉法加广场上与乌里尔会面时打招呼道。

Uriel shook her head, burying her hands in her pockets.  
乌里尔摇了摇头，把双手插进口袋里。

"Nothing. Not at St. Paul's, or the Tower, or Madame Tussauds."  
没有。不在圣保罗大教堂，也不在伦敦塔，或者杜莎夫人蜡像馆。

"It's the same on my end." Michael let out a frustrated grunt, stalking off towards Soho. "I just hope Gabriel is actually still in the city."  
我的情况也一样。迈克尔沮丧地咕哝了一声，朝着苏豪区走去。“我只希望加布里埃尔还在城里。”

They walked in gloomy silence for a bit, up around Sondheim Theater.  
他们默默无言地走了一段时间，绕过桑德海姆剧院。

"Did you know," Uriel began, in an unpracticed right-gonna-lighten-the-mood-if-only-for-my-own-sanity's-sake tone, "that London isn't technically a city?"  
"你知道吗，"乌里尔开始说，语气有些生疏，好像是为了缓解气氛，至少是为了保持自己的理智，"伦敦在技术上并不是一个城市。"

Michael stopped. 迈克尔停下来。

"Pardon?" 请再说一遍？

"God's truth. By British human definitions London's not a city. Nor's Reading. But The City of Westminster is, as is the City of London, over by the Tower. And St Davids."  
上帝的真理。按照英国人的定义，伦敦不是一个城市。雷丁也不是。但威斯敏斯特市是，伦敦市也是，在塔附近。还有圣大卫市。

Michael stared at her quite blankly.  
迈克尔一脸茫然地盯着她。

"That..." She shook her head. "Humans, I swear."  
“那个……”她摇了摇头。“人类，我发誓。”

Uriel shrugged. 乌里尔耸了耸肩。

"Exactly." "没错。"

They walked for a little more, when Michael took a deep breath, with an expression as if she knew she'd regret asking.  
他们继续走了一小段路，当迈克尔深吸一口气时，脸上带着一种表情，仿佛她知道自己会后悔问这个问题。

"What does make something a city then?"  
那么，什么才能让某个地方成为一座城市呢？

Again Uriel shrugged. 乌里尔再次耸了耸肩。

"Something to do with cheese, I think..."  
"好像跟奶酪有关吧，我想..."

See? Michael was right about regretting asking. A smile did tug on her lips, but it faltered fairly fast.  
看到了吗？迈克尔关于后悔提问的说法是对的。她的嘴角微微上扬了一下，但很快就消失了。

"I really appreciated you trying to lighten the mood. Still, I _do_ hope Gabriel is somewhere in London. He can't just have gone off the map."  
我真的很感激你试图缓和气氛。不过，我希望加布里埃尔还在伦敦的某个地方。他不可能就这样消失了。

More silence followed. 接着是更多的沉默。

"Then again," Uriel began, rather reluctantly, "_if_ he _has_ anything to do with..."  
"再说了，"乌里尔有些不情愿地开始说道，"如果他与...有任何关系的话..."

Michael rose a hand to cut her companion off.  
迈克尔举起手来打断她的伴侣。

"I... I don't want to hear it."  
"我...我不想听。"

The response was a stoic nod.  
回应是一次坚毅的点头。

"I'm sorry," apologised Uriel, as they passed Old Compton Street.  
“对不起。”乌里尔在经过老康普顿街时道歉道。

Michael hummed, looking at the other Archangel while she sorted her thoughts.  
迈克尔哼着小曲，看着另一个大天使整理思绪。

"No, no, you're right, Uriel. It is looking really bad for Gabriel. I..." Michael fell silent. Uriel let this silence hang in the air like cobwebs, until she stepped in front of the other Archangel, and cast Michael a scrutinising yet worried glance.  
“不，不，你说得对，乌里尔。加百列的情况确实很糟糕。我……”迈克尔沉默了下来。乌里尔让这个沉默像蜘蛛网一样悬挂在空中，直到她走到另一个大天使面前，投给迈克尔一瞥既审视又担忧的目光。

"I meant to ask this before. Are you blaming yourself for what occurred?"  
我本来就想问这个问题。你是不是在责怪自己发生了什么事情？

Once again Michael's response was a sigh and to fall silent. Then she shook her head and sat down on a bench. This seemed to surprise Uriel.\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
迈克尔再次的回应是一声叹息和沉默。然后她摇了摇头，坐在了一张长椅上。这似乎让乌列尔感到惊讶。\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
\-  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Michael's reaction that is, not that there normally are no benches along Wardour Street.  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 迈克尔的反应是，沃多街上通常是没有长椅的。  
\-  
"What?" Michael inquired, tiredly. Uriel sat down next to her.  
"什么？" 迈克尔疲倦地询问道。乌里尔坐在她旁边。

"I... expected you dismiss the notion. It's concerning to see that you are not."  
我...本来以为你会对这个想法不屑一顾。看到你并非如此，让人感到担忧。

"I'm worried." Michael exhaled, shaking her head. "You know how he's been recently. More on edge than ever."  
"我很担心。"迈克尔叹了口气，摇了摇头。“你知道他最近的状态。比以往更加紧张。”

"Understandably," Uriel's tone was stoic, but thoughtful. "But just because..." She rubbed her forehead. "Oh, curses. We should have asked Raph again what she meant by expecting Gabriel to snap one of these days."  
"可以理解的," Uriel的语气冷静而深思。"但仅仅因为..."她揉了揉额头。"哎呀，真倒霉。我们应该再问问拉斐尔，她到底是什么意思，说加百列总有一天会发飙。"

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"I think we all forgot, but just when you came in telling us Gabriel's in London, Raphael mentioned she's been expecting Gabriel to snap one of these days, but didn't reveal why."  
我觉得我们都忘了，但就在你进来告诉我们加百列在伦敦的时候，拉斐尔提到她一直在等着加百列有一天会发飙，但没有透露原因。

"Oh... Oh no." 哦...哦不。

Michael paled, crossed arms shifting closer around her body as if she was hugging herself.  
迈克尔脸色苍白，双臂交叉，身体紧紧地贴在一起，仿佛在拥抱自己。

"Michael?" "迈克尔？"

"I'm fine. I... I think. It's just..."  
我没事。我...我想是的。只是...

"Just what." 就这样。

"If Raphael said that..."  
如果拉斐尔说过...

A moment of silence passed by with the speed and gravitas of a glacier forming fjords.  
一瞬间的寂静如同冰川形成峡湾般，缓慢而庄重地流逝。

"Yes?" Uriel dared. "什么事？"乌里尔大胆地问道。

Michael shook her head. 迈克尔摇了摇头。

"If Raphael said that, then... Uriel, _if_ it _is_ Gabriel who went and raided the vault, The Archives, did all of that... then..."  
如果拉斐尔说了那样的话，那么...乌列尔，如果是加百列去抢劫了金库，档案馆，做了那一切...那么...

Then Uriel noticed Michael's haunted look.  
然后乌里尔注意到迈克尔那受困扰的表情。

"Michael," she began, very slowly and very deliberately, "_What_ then?"  
"迈克尔，" 她缓慢而有意识地开始说道，"那又如何呢？"

Another glacier passed by before Michael answered, stare blank.  
迈克尔回答之前，又经过了另一座冰川，他茫然地凝视着。

"Then Gabriel might be trying to kickstart the Apocalypse."  
那么加百列可能正在试图启动启示录。
