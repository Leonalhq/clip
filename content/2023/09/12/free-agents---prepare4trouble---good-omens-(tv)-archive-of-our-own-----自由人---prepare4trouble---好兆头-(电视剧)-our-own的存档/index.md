### Chapter Text 章节正文

“Crowley?” “克劳利？”

The whisper of his name broke the silence that had settled over the bookshop, and Crowley looked up in surprise. He had been sitting, not doing very much of anything, in one of the chairs by Aziraphale’s desk much in the same position he had been since the last time he had replenished the cup of tea by the bed. He had just been about to fall asleep, or maybe he had already been asleep and was beginning to stir, when he was jarred unexpectedly back to full consciousness.  
他的名字的低语打破了书店上空的寂静，克劳利惊讶地抬起头。他一直坐在阿齐拉费尔桌子旁的椅子上，几乎什么都没做，姿势和上次他为床边的茶杯添水时一样。他刚要入睡，或者他可能已经入睡了，开始醒来时，突然被意外地完全清醒了过来。

Aziraphale was standing nervously at the bottom of the spiral staircase that led to the upper level of the shop, the living area that had until very recently been used only for the storage of books that didn’t fit in the shop itself. More recently, a former Supreme Archangel had slept, drunk his weight in hot chocolate, and nearly jumped out of a window there. More recently still, it was where Crowley had placed Aziraphale on the bed and left him there to rest and recover.  
阿齐拉费尔紧张地站在通往店铺上层的螺旋楼梯底部，这个居住区直到最近才被用来存放无法放在店内的书籍。最近，一位前至高天使在那里睡觉，喝了他体重的热巧克力，几乎跳出窗户。更近一点，克劳利把阿齐拉费尔放在床上，让他休息和恢复。

Well, to recover as well as he possibly could.  
好吧，尽可能恢复得好。

Honestly, he hadn’t expected to see him on his feet for weeks, maybe even more.  
老实说，他没想到几周甚至更久都能看到他站起来。

He didn’t look as though he _should_ be on his feet. He looked exhausted; drained of all energy. There was a frailty to him that made Crowley think of a human man who had been sick for a very long time, who had been tortured, and who was on the edge of breaking completely. And perhaps that was essentially what _had_ happened. The denizens of Hell enjoyed torture, and even if they hadn’t had the chance, the process of Falling itself was a torture all of its own.  
他看起来不像是能站起来的样子。他看起来筋疲力尽，精疲力竭。他身上有一种脆弱感，让克劳利想起一个长期生病、被折磨得几近崩溃的人类男子。也许这就是发生的事情。地狱的居民喜欢折磨，即使他们没有机会，堕落本身也是一种折磨。

Aziraphale trembled noticeably, one hand gripping the bottom of the spiral bannister for support. The expression on his face was strained, yet he tried to force a smile.  
亚齐拉费尔明显颤抖，一只手紧紧抓住螺旋楼梯的底部以获得支撑。他脸上的表情很紧张，但他试图强迫自己微笑。

There was a lot held in that expression; apprehension, uncertainty, fear. Perhaps, although Crowley wasn’t sure, even a hint of hope, but if that really had been there, it was gone before he had the chance to recognise it.  
那个表情中蕴含着许多东西：忧虑、不确定、恐惧。或许，虽然克劳利不确定，甚至还有一丝希望的迹象，但如果真的有的话，在他还没来得及认识到它之前，它已经消失了。

Crowley was on his feet in seconds. With one arm around Aziraphale’s shoulders, he led him to his favourite chair, the one by the desk. Aziraphale released his grip on the bannister, leaving a black mark behind on the dark metal, noticed only by Crowley, and allowed himself to be led across the room before collapsing into the chair  
克劳利几秒钟内站了起来。他一只手搭在亚齐拉费尔的肩膀上，带着他走向他最喜欢的椅子，那把靠近书桌的椅子。亚齐拉费尔松开了扶手，留下了一道黑印在深色金属上，只有克劳利注意到了，然后他任由自己被带过房间，坐到了椅子上。

“I didn’t think you’d be up yet,” he said, partly because it was true, but mostly because he couldn't think of anything else to say. If he hadn’t filled the silence with _something_, he might have asked how Aziraphale was feeling, and he didn’t want to do that. He had a very good idea already.  
“我没想到你已经醒了，”他说道，部分是因为这是真的，但更多是因为他想不出其他话来说。如果他没有用什么来填补沉默，他可能会问亚齐拉费尔感觉如何，而他并不想这样做。他已经有一个很好的想法了。

Aziraphale didn’t reply. Crowley left him on the chair and moved back to the staircase where he rubbed at the black smudge with the sleeve of his jacket.  
亚齐拉费尔没有回答。克劳利把他留在椅子上，走回楼梯那里，用夹克袖子擦拭着黑色的污渍。

“Want something to eat?” He suggested. “Or… tea? Hot chocolate?”  
"想吃点东西吗？"他建议道。“或者...喝茶？热巧克力？"

Aziraphale shook his head.  
亚齐拉费尔摇了摇头。

“Right.” Crowley nodded. "好的。"克劳利点了点头。

He ground his teeth, and sank into another chair. He looked across at Aziraphale, who was sitting, body rigid with tension. The bookshop had always been his safe place, and over the years it had become Crowley’s too. The two of them sitting there together felt almost like old times, only it wasn’t. Everything was different now. Nothing would ever be the same again.  
他咬紧牙关，沉入另一把椅子里。他望向坐在那里身体紧绷的阿齐拉费尔。书店一直是他的安全之地，多年来也成为了克劳利的安慰所。他们两个人一起坐在那里，感觉几乎像是过去的时光，只是不一样了。现在一切都不同了。再也不会一样了。

“Want to talk about what happened up there?” he asked, quietly.  
“想谈谈刚才发生的事吗？”他轻声问道。

Aziraphale clenched his hands together and looked down into his lap. “I suppose I’d better,” he said. He began to fidget, his fingers moving, locking together and then breaking apart. He stared down at them, but glassy-eyed, not appearing to actually _look_ at anything. “Crowley, why did you never tell me?” he asked.  
阿齐拉费尔紧握双手，低头看着自己的膝盖。“我想我最好还是说说吧，”他说。他开始坐立不安，手指交织在一起，然后又分开。他凝视着它们，但眼神呆滞，似乎并没有真正看到任何东西。“克劳利，你为什么从未告诉过我？”他问道。

At his words, Crowley stilled. Aziraphale was no longer whispering as he had a moment earlier when he had said Crowley’s name. His voice was hoarse from disuse, or perhaps from overuse; there would have been screaming, Crowley was certain of that. Unshed tears in his eyes glinted, reflecting the lamplight in the dimly lit bookshop.  
听到他的话，克劳利停了下来。阿齐拉费尔不再像刚才那样低声细语，他刚才说克劳利的名字时。他的声音因为不用或者过度使用而嘶哑，克劳利确信那里曾经有尖叫声。他眼中未流下的泪水在昏暗的书店里反射着灯光。

There was a lot that he hadn’t told him over the years. There were things that he had done that he knew Aziraphale wouldn’t approve of, kept secret because he didn’t want to see the disappointment in his eyes, and there were things he had done that he had known the angel absolutely _would_ approve of, that he had kept quiet because he didn’t want to deal with the praise, or the accusations that he might be ‘nice’. He got the feeling that whatever Aziraphale was talking about, it wasn’t one of those.  
多年来，他有很多事情没有告诉他。有些事情他做过，他知道亚齐拉费尔不会赞同，所以他保守了秘密，因为他不想看到他眼中的失望；还有些事情他做过，他知道天使绝对会赞同，但他选择保持沉默，因为他不想处理赞美，或者面对被称为“好人”的指责。他感觉到亚齐拉费尔所说的不是这些事情之一。

He _had_ told Aziraphale how he felt about him, and about what he had wanted for the two of them, but he supposed the accusation could still be about that. He had left it far too late. That hadn’t been his fault though; he was a _demon_ for Satan’s sake. He wasn’t made to recognise love when he felt it.  
他告诉过亚齐拉费尔他对他的感受，以及他们两个人的未来，但他猜想指责可能还是与此有关。他已经晚了太久。但这并不是他的错；他是撒旦的恶魔。他没有被制造成能够辨认出爱的感觉。

But no, it couldn’t be that. Aziraphale had far bigger, far more important things on his mind right now that _that_.  
但不，不可能是那个。亚齐拉费尔现在心里有更重要的事情要考虑。

No, the only thing it could possibly be, was that Crowley had known what the Archangels had been planning; that they were going to make another attempt to end life on Earth. He hadn’t known exactly what they had intended to _do_, but the recordings he had seen on his brief infiltration of Heaven had told him that a plan was already in place. He had known that the Metatron would try to use Aziraphale to help with that goal, and he hadn’t warned him about it. He had mentioned them ending life on Earth, but he hadn’t told him that he _knew_, or how.  
不，唯一可能的原因是，克劳利知道大天使们正在策划什么；他们将再次试图终结地球上的生命。他不知道他们具体打算做什么，但他在短暂渗透天堂时看到的记录告诉他，计划已经制定好了。他知道梅塔特隆会试图利用亚齐拉费尔来实现这个目标，而他没有警告他。他提到了他们要终结地球上的生命，但他没有告诉他他知道，或者知道的方式。

He had been too deeply in shock at Aziraphale’s revelation.  
他对亚齐拉费尔的启示感到震惊得太深了。

“I did _try_ to tell you,” he said. “Sort of.”  
“我确实试着告诉过你，”他说。“某种程度上。”

Aziraphale frowned, as though trying to replay their last conversation in his head.  
亚齐拉费尔皱起眉头，仿佛在脑海中回放他们最后一次对话。

“I did!” Crowley insisted. “I told you they were going to destroy life on Earth, and you acted like you didn’t even hear me. You were so focussed on trying to convince me to become an angel again.”  
“我告诉过你！”克劳利坚称。“我告诉过你他们将要毁灭地球上的生命，而你却好像根本没听见我说的话。你太专注于试图说服我再次成为天使了。”

Aziraphale at least had the good grace to look ashamed at that. Or perhaps embarrassed. There was definitely a hint of longing in there too, as the loss of his own angelic status hit him anew. He blinked hard and drew in a deep breath, and Crowley fought down the urge to apologise.  
亚齐拉费尔至少还有点羞愧的样子。或者说是尴尬。他的眼神中肯定有一丝渴望，因为他再次感受到了自己失去天使身份的痛苦。他用力眨了眨眼，深吸了一口气，克劳利忍住了道歉的冲动。

Aziraphale beat him to it. “You were right,” he said. “I was wrong.” his lips curved upward in a ghost of a smile which did not reach his eyes. “I can’t do the dance. Not now. It hurts too much.”  
亚齐拉费尔抢先说道：“你是对的，我错了。”他的嘴角微微上扬，但眼神中并没有笑意。“我现在无法跳那个舞蹈。太痛苦了。”

“I don’t want you to do the stupid dance,” Crowley told him. “I was going to invite you out for breakfast at the Ritz, you know. I wanted to talk about other stuff first, but I was going to tell you everything I knew about what they were planning.” He hadn’t known _much_, but he hadn’t intended to keep it a secret.  
“我不想让你跳那个愚蠢的舞蹈，”克劳利告诉他。“我本来打算邀请你去丽兹酒店吃早餐，你知道的。我想先谈谈其他事情，但我打算告诉你我所知道的一切。”他并不知道太多，但他并不打算保守秘密。

“That isn’t what I…” “我并不是说我……”

“I spent ages trying to come up with ways to get you a message, too, after you left,” he added. “But it was impossible. Muriel was useless, since a 37th level scrivener can’t just book in an appointment with the Supreme Archangel, so I thought maybe they could take me up there to tell you myself, but they refused. So then I thought I’d just write you a note, but…”  
“你走后，我花了很长时间想办法给你传个信，但是不可能的。”他补充道。“穆里尔没用，因为一个37级的抄写员不可能直接预约至尊大天使，所以我想也许他们可以带我去那里亲自告诉你，但是他们拒绝了。所以我想写个便条给你，但是……”

With what looked like a huge amount of effort, Aziraphale held up a hand as though trying to silence him. “Crowley, please….”  
阿齐拉费尔费了很大的力气，举起手好像要让他安静下来。“克劳利，请……”

He stopped, for a moment. When Aziraphale didn’t fill the silence, he continued, determined to get his point across. “After a couple of days, I figured it was too late. It’s not like I knew _much_ anyway, I didn’t know the actual plan, just what the end result was going to be. You probably knew more than me.”  
他停了一会儿。当阿齐拉费尔没有打破沉默时，他决心表达自己的观点。“几天过去了，我觉得已经太晚了。反正我也不知道太多，我不知道具体的计划，只知道最终的结果会是什么。你可能比我知道得更多。”

Aziraphale nodded. “I did. In fact, I was told a little before I even got into the lift.”  
阿齐拉费尔点了点头。“是的。事实上，我甚至在进电梯之前就被告知了一点。”

“And you still _went_?” "你还去了吗？"

Irritation crept into his expression now. “Of _course_ I did. I didn’t have any choice in the matter.”  
他的表情中逐渐浮现出烦躁。“当然去了。我没有选择。”

“Sounded like you did to me. Sounded like they made you the offer to go back upstairs, and you leapt at the chance. What happened to ‘I was wrong’ from a minute ago?”  
“听起来像是你自愿的。听起来他们给了你回到楼上的机会，你迫不及待地接受了。刚才的‘我错了’怎么了？”

“I wasn’t wrong to go. I knew they were planning something terrible, and I wanted the opportunity to prevent it. I _was_ wrong to ask you to go with me,” Aziraphale clarified. “It was unfair to you, and more to the point, I’m now certain that if it _was_ a genuine offer, they would have used your presence against me. They threatened you anyway, to try to make me do what they wanted. If you were _there_, if you were an angel, it would have been so much worse.”  
“我去并没有错。我知道他们在策划一些可怕的事情，我想要机会去阻止它发生。我错在让你跟我一起去。”亚齐拉费尔解释道。“对你来说是不公平的，更重要的是，我现在确信如果那是一个真正的提议，他们会利用你的存在来对付我。他们无论如何都威胁了你，试图让我按照他们的意愿行事。如果你在那里，如果你是一个天使，情况会更糟糕。”

“Why didn’t you just leave?” Crowley asked.  
“你为什么不离开呢？”克劳利问道。

Aziraphale thought about it, then gave a tiny, barely perceptible shrug of his shoulders. “I did,” he said quietly. “But until that point… You see, Metatron had access to the Book of Life, and I rather like you existing, Crowley. I thought it would be pertinent to… to preserve that.”  
亚齐拉费尔思考了一下，然后微微耸了耸肩膀，几乎察觉不到。“我确实离开了，”他轻声说道。“但在那之前...你知道，梅塔特隆可以接触到生命之书，而我很喜欢你的存在，克劳利。我觉得保留下来是很重要的。”

Crowley blinked. “Extreme sanctions?” A few months ago, he hadn’t even known it was a real thing. Now, he knew better. Now, the book’s existence scared him. To die would be bad enough, but never to have existed at all, not to be remembered by anybody… He shook his head. “He wouldn’t dare. I helped build half the universe, Angel. If he erased me, it would be a hell of a lot emptier out there. _And_ I convinced Eve to eat the apple. Without me, the whole course of human history would have been different.”  
克劳利眨了眨眼。“极端制裁？”几个月前，他甚至不知道这是真实存在的事情。现在，他更清楚了。现在，这本书的存在让他感到害怕。死亡已经够糟糕了，但从未存在过，没有任何人记得自己...他摇了摇头。“他不敢。我帮助建造了一半的宇宙，天使。如果他抹去了我，那里将会空荡荡得多。而且我说服夏娃吃了苹果。没有我，整个人类历史的进程都会不同。”

“Yes, well I did think about that actually.”  
“是的，嗯，我确实考虑过。”

Aziraphale raised a hand and ran it nervously through his hair, leaving another dark streak in the blonde curls. Crowley found his gaze drawn to it, as the things that he had seen over the past few days began to click into place.  
亚齐拉费尔抬起一只手，紧张地抚摸着自己的头发，又在金色的卷发上留下一道深色的痕迹。克劳利的目光被吸引了过去，因为他在过去几天里看到的事情开始有了头绪。

“If you had never existed, I’m sure some other angel would have been asked to design those stars and nebulae. And the whole apple thing was part of the ineffable plan, so I’m sure it would have happened one way or another.”  
“如果你从未存在过，我相信其他天使会被要求设计那些星星和星云。而整个苹果事件也是不可言喻的计划的一部分，所以我相信它总会以某种方式发生。”

Crowley folded his arms. They were getting off track here, but he didn’t care. “So what you’re saying,” he said, “is that it wouldn’t really matter if I existed or not.”  
克劳利双臂交叉。他们离题了，但他并不在意。“所以你的意思是，我存在与否并不重要。”

“It matters,” Aziraphale told him. “It matters a great deal. To me.” He reached out and touched Crowley on the hand. His fingertips left parallel lines of dark grey as he ran his hand over Crowley’s skin. He froze, staring at the marks in confusion, then pulled back his hand and examined it, appearing to notice the discolouration for the first time.  
“它很重要，”亚齐拉费尔告诉他。“对我来说非常重要。”他伸出手，触摸了一下克劳利的手。他的指尖在克劳利的皮肤上留下了一道平行的深灰色线条。他愣住了，困惑地盯着手上的痕迹，然后缩回手，仔细检查，似乎是第一次注意到这种变色。

He didn’t need to be thinking about _that_ right now. Crowley rubbed at the dark marks with his sleeve, smudging them, but not managing to erase them completely. He forced a grin. “No other angel would have been able to top _my_ designs,” he said.  
他现在不需要考虑那个问题。克劳利用袖子擦拭着那些黑色的痕迹，虽然没有完全擦掉，但也模糊了一些。他勉强笑了笑。“没有其他天使能够超越我的设计。”他说道。

Aziraphale’s hand dropped into his lap and he turned his attention back to Crowley. “No, of course not,” he said. “If anybody else had designed those nebulae, they wouldn’t have been anywhere near as beautiful.”  
亚齐拉费尔的手放在膝盖上，他把注意力转回克劳利身上。“不，当然不会。”他说道。“如果有其他人设计了那些星云，它们不会像现在这样美丽。”

Something twisted inside him, as Crowley remembered the way it had looked, the colours that he could no longer perceive. It was a pain that he had grown accustomed too, and he gave no outward sign. “Anyway, to answer your question,” he said, inexpertly and awkwardly steering the conversation back to the beginning. “That’s why I didn’t tell you about Apocalypse 2.0, because I didn’t get the chance.”  
克劳利内心扭曲，他记得它的样子，那些他无法再感知的颜色。这是一种他已经习惯的痛苦，他没有表现出任何外在的迹象。“无论如何，回答你的问题，”他笨拙地把话题引回到最初。“这就是为什么我没有告诉你有关《启示录2.0》的原因，因为我没有机会。”

“Oh, Crowley, it’s okay. That isn’t what I meant. I told you, I already knew what I would be taking on when I agreed to go, and I had no intention of following through with the plan. But I thought… I _hoped_… that I might be able to change things from the inside.”  
“哦，克劳利，没关系。我不是那个意思。我告诉过你，我早就知道我要承担什么，我从来没有打算按照计划行事。但我曾经希望……我希望我能够从内部改变事情。”

“Yeah, that was never going to happen,” Crowley told him, a little more harshly than he had intended. “Look what happened the _last_ time someone got ideas like that.”  
“是的，那是永远不可能发生的事情，”克劳利有些严厉地告诉他。“看看上次有人有那种想法发生了什么。”

Aziraphale clasped his hands together nervously. “Yes. I know that _now_. But you’re right, I suppose. At least I didn’t take anybody else down with me.”  
亚齐拉费尔紧张地双手合十。“是的，我现在知道了。但你是对的，我想。至少我没有连累其他人。”

Crowley didn’t say anything. For his money, taking a few Archangels down with him wouldn’t have been a bad thing at all. But then, it was rarely the ones who most deserved it that ended up being punished, was it?  
克劳利没有说什么。对他来说，带上一些大天使并不是一件坏事。但是，往往是那些最应该受到惩罚的人最终没有受到惩罚，不是吗？

“You _were_ right to say no when I offered to take you with me,” Aziraphale told him again. “I know you already know that, but it’s important to me that you know that _I_ know it too. I realised very soon after I arrived what they would have used you for, if you had agreed.”  
“当我提出带你一起走时，你拒绝是对的，”亚齐拉费尔再次告诉他。“我知道你已经知道了，但对我来说，你知道我也知道这一点很重要。我到达后很快意识到，如果你同意了，他们会利用你。”

“Oh yeah? And what’s that?” Crowley asked, genuinely curious. For the life of him, he couldn’t think of a single benefit to Heaven of having a pissed off, very powerful former demon up there protecting their Supreme Archangel from his new employees and working very hard to thwart the other Archangel’s plans. It wasn’t as though they needed him in Heaven to carry out the Book of Life threat.  
"哦是吗？那是什么？”克劳利好奇地问道。他想不出让天堂为了保护他们的至高大天使免受新员工的威胁，以及努力阻挠其他大天使计划的愤怒且非常强大的前恶魔在那里有什么好处。他们并不需要他在天堂执行《生命之书》的威胁。

“They would have used you to make me do what they wanted,” Aziraphale told him. “They would have threatened to cast you back down into Hell, and I think I would have done what they asked, to keep you safe.”  
“他们会利用你来逼迫我做他们想要的事情，”亚齐拉费尔告诉他。“他们会威胁把你重新扔回地狱，我想我会听从他们的要求，只为了保护你。”

Crowley’s mouth went dry. He remembered his initial horror and revulsion when he had first heard the offer to make him an angel again. That had sounded like a threat to him, to take what he was, what he had made of himself in the millennia since they had thrown him away, and to remake him, to twist and manipulate him into something of their own design, something that he could never truly be again.  
克劳利的嘴巴变得干燥。他记得当初听到再次成为天使的提议时，他感到恐惧和厌恶。对他来说，那听起来像是一种威胁，要夺走他的本质，夺走他在被抛弃后的千年中所成就的一切，将他重新塑造，扭曲和操控成他们自己设计的东西，一种他永远无法真正成为的东西。

He would have gone in a heartbeat, if he had known what the future held. He would have let them do it, he would have relived the horror of being remade against his will, and then he would have gladly let them toss him away again, with no way to know whether the thing that crawled out of the sulphur for a second time would be in any way recognisable as him.  
如果他知道未来会发生什么，他会毫不犹豫地去做。他会让他们这样做，他会再次经历被违背意愿重塑的恐怖，然后他会欣然接受被再次抛弃，无法知道第二次从硫磺中爬出来的东西是否还能以任何方式被认出是他自己。

He would have done it gladly, if he could have spared Aziraphale a similar trauma.  
如果他能够避免让阿齐拉费尔经历类似的创伤，他会很乐意去做。

He didn’t tell him so; it wouldn’t help. It was far too late for that.  
他没有告诉他，这样也没有帮助。为时已晚了。

“As it was, they only had me to threaten,” Aziraphale added. “And I was perfectly willing to call their bluff.”  
“事实上，他们只能威胁我一个人，”阿齐拉费尔补充道。“而我完全愿意挑战他们的虚张声势。”

Only it hadn’t been a bluff, Crowley thought to himself. He wondered whether it had even crossed Aziraphale’s mind that they might go through with it.  
克劳利心想，其实那并不是虚张声势。他想知道阿齐拉费尔是否曾经想过他们可能会付诸行动。

The memory of his own Fall was still fresh, even now, many thousands of years later. It was indelible, seared into his mind, as it was for every demon, _right there_ on the edge of his consciousness, ready for him to reach for at any moment.  
他自己堕落的记忆至今仍然历历在目，即使是在许多千年之后。它是无法磨灭的，深深地刻在他的脑海中，就像每一个恶魔一样，就在他的意识边缘，随时准备着他随时取用。

The Fall itself had been bad enough, terrifying in its literality. Wings flapping frantically even as they began to smoulder, he had tried to raise himself up against the terrible and undeniable force of gravity. The pain was unbearable even before the moment of impact. At such velocity, there was no difference between hitting molten sulphur, and solid granite; his wings had been broken, his halo shattered, and then he had begun to sink into the boiling lake of sulphur.  
堕落本身已经够糟糕了，它的字面意义令人恐惧。他的翅膀拼命地扇动，即使开始冒烟，他试图抵抗可怕而不可否认的重力。在撞击的那一刻之前，痛苦已经无法忍受。以如此的速度，撞击熔化的硫磺和坚硬的花岗岩之间没有任何区别；他的翅膀被折断，他的光环被粉碎，然后他开始沉入沸腾的硫磺湖中。

He had no memory of screaming, but he knew that he must have. He remembered fear, and confusion, and the cries of pain and terror all around him. He remembered the stench of sulphur, and the agony as his body burned away leaving something different, something fundamentally changed, in its stead.  
他没有记得自己尖叫，但他知道他一定尖叫过。他记得恐惧、困惑，以及周围的痛苦和恐怖的呼喊声。他记得硫磺的恶臭，以及他的身体燃烧时的痛苦，留下了一种不同的东西，一种根本性的改变。

Most of all, because it was something that he had carried with him ever since, he remembered the emptiness inside of him; the gaping cavern where his Mother’s love had used to reside, and the all-pervading sadness when he looked up into the night sky and did not see what he knew to be there.  
首先，因为这是他一直以来都带在身边的东西，他记得他内心的空虚；他母亲的爱曾经驻扎的巨大洞穴，以及当他抬头望向夜空时，没有看到他所知道的东西时，弥漫的悲伤。

Most memories dulled with time; not to the extent that human memory faded, but enough to blunt the impact of the worst pain. That particular memory never had, and never would. While Crowley would never, ever have chosen to go through it again, he hated even more the thought of what had happened instead. That, and that Aziraphale had gone through it alone.  
大多数记忆随着时间的流逝而变得模糊；虽然不至于人类的记忆会褪色，但足以减弱最糟糕的痛苦的影响。那个特定的记忆从来没有，也永远不会。虽然克劳利永远不会选择再次经历那段经历，但他更讨厌发生了其他事情的想法。还有，阿齐拉费尔一个人经历了那一切。

A shudder caught him off-guard, and he shrugged, trying to disguise it as he tried to push the memory aside. When he looked at Aziraphale again, he was staring back with a sympathetic expression, as though he could read the direction his thoughts had been taking.  
一阵战栗让他措手不及，他耸了耸肩，试图掩饰它，同时试图把记忆推到一边。当他再次看着阿齐拉费尔时，对方用同情的表情回望着他，仿佛能读出他思绪的方向。

“I don’t know,” Crowley said, falling back reflexively into old patterns of conversation. “It might have been fun to have another go. It wasn’t so bad the first time. Tickled a bit.”  
“我不知道，”克劳利说着，本能地回到了以前的对话模式。“也许再试一次会很有趣。第一次并不那么糟糕。有点痒。”

Aziraphale’s expression grew haunted, and Crowley knew that he was experiencing his own, matching, memory. He reached out with one hand as though to touch Crowley, then reconsidered and took his hand back again. “I always assumed you were lying when you said things like that,” he told him. “Now, I know it for certain.”  
Aziraphale的表情变得苍白，克劳利知道他正在经历自己的、相匹配的记忆。他伸出一只手，仿佛要触摸克劳利，然后重新考虑了一下，把手收了回来。“以前你说这种话的时候，我总是以为你在撒谎，”他告诉他。“现在，我确定了。”

Crowley stilled at that. He felt exposed. It had been years since he had felt the need to cover his eyes when it was just the two of them together in the shop, but now he found himself craving the barrier that the dark glasses placed between himself and the rest of the world. They were out of reach, somewhere at the other side of the shop. Instead, he had to make do with angling his face away and shrugging as nonchalantly as he could muster. “Well, you always did like being right.”  
克劳利听到这句话时停了下来。他感到暴露无遗。多年来，当他们两个人在店里时，他已经不再感到需要遮住眼睛，但现在他发现自己渴望那副墨镜所带来的隔离感，它们就在店的另一边，无法触及。相反，他只能把脸转开，尽可能地装作漫不经心地耸耸肩。“嗯，你总是喜欢对的。”

“Not this time. Not about this. Why did you never tell me about it, Crowley?”  
“这次不一样。关于这个你为什么从来没告诉过我，克劳利？”

He blinked in surprise. That was what Aziraphale had been asking about; what he had been accusing him of never telling him? Aside from the fact that the angel had never actually _asked_ him about it, he hadn’t really wanted to talk about it. He still didn’t. He wasn’t sure that he even had the _words_ to talk about it.  He sucked in a deep breath. “It’ll be okay, you know.”  
他惊讶地眨了眨眼。这就是Aziraphale一直在问的事情吗？他一直在指责他从未告诉过他的事情？除了天使实际上从未问过他，他也不想谈论这个。他现在仍然不想谈论。他甚至不确定自己是否有能力用言语表达出来。他深吸了一口气。“你知道，一切都会好的。”

Aziraphale straightened his spine, correcting his posture, then rubbed at one eye with a finger in a failed attempt to be subtle about wiping his eye. He left behind a dark grey mark, like badly applied eyeshadow. Crowley’s fingers twitched, itching to reach for the box of tissues on the desk and hand him one, but reluctant to draw his attention back to the problem.  
阿齐拉费尔挺直了脊梁，纠正了姿势，然后用手指揉了揉眼睛，试图不引人注目地擦拭眼睛。他留下了一个深灰色的痕迹，就像涂抹得很糟糕的眼影。克劳利的手指抽搐了一下，渴望伸手拿起桌子上的纸巾盒递给他，但又不愿意把他的注意力引回到问题上。

“I wish I…” Aziraphale began, then shook his head as though having thought better of whatever he had been about to say. Instead, he locked eyes with Crowley and smiled. “I would have liked to have gone to the Ritz for breakfast that morning.”  
“我希望我……”阿齐拉费尔开始说，然后摇了摇头，好像对自己原本要说的话想得更清楚了。相反，他与克劳利对视并微笑道：“那天早上我本来想去丽兹酒店吃早餐的。”

The sudden change of topic gave Crowley a case of conversational whiplash and it took him a moment to reverse the things they had spoken about in his mind and pick up where they had been far earlier. “We can still go, you know.”  
话题的突然转变让克劳利感到头晕目眩，他花了一会儿才在脑海中倒转他们之前谈论的事情，并继续之前的话题。“我们还是可以去的，你知道吗。”

Aziraphale smiled sadly and shook his head.  
阿齐拉费尔悲伤地微笑着摇了摇头。

“We _can_. Maybe not tomorrow or anything, but one day.”  
“我们可以。也许不是明天或其他什么时候，但总有一天。”

Aziraphale, his eye still blackened, looked at him unconvinced.  
阿齐拉费尔（Aziraphale）的眼睛还是青肿的，他不相信地看着他。

“It’s not always going to be like this, you know.”  
“你知道，不会永远都是这样的。”

The smile didn’t reach his eyes. “I rather think it _is_. After all, isn’t that the whole point? I don’t think they’re going to offer to take me back after what I did.” As he spoke, Aziraphale’s voice trembled slightly, but his gaze managed to remain steady.  
微笑没有达到他的眼睛。“我倒是觉得会。毕竟，那不就是整个意义吗？我不认为他们会因为我所做的事情而主动接纳我回去。”阿齐拉费尔说话时声音微颤，但他的目光仍然保持稳定。

Would he even _want_ them to? Crowley didn’t ask; he had a feeling he already knew the answer. Maybe in a few thousand years it would be different, but not yet. “It gets better, Angel. Trust me on that.”  
他会想要吗？克劳利没有问，他有一种感觉他已经知道答案了。也许几千年后会有所不同，但现在还不行。“会好起来的，天使。相信我。”

“I do trust you,” Aziraphale said, and Crowley knew it to be true.  
“我相信你，”亚齐拉费尔说，克劳利知道这是真的。

“Do you trust me enough to tell me what you did up there?” he asked.  
“你相信我到足够告诉我你在那里做了什么吗？”他问道。

Aziraphale didn’t even hesitate. “I fixed it,” he said, simply.  
亚齐拉费尔甚至没有犹豫。“我修好了，”他简单地说道。

“Okay. But how?”🔄  ❓

“Crowley, you told me once that damnation wasn’t so bad once you got used to it. I know you were joking, trying to push me like you do, but tell me, was there any truth in it?”🔄  ❓

Well, if Aziraphale was going to ignore his questions, Crowley was going to do the same. That was an impossible one to answer, anyway. There were parts that were tolerable, parts that he would never forgive the Almighty for, and parts that he revelled in, and for Aziraphale he was sure it was going to be the same.🔄  ❓

Crowley reached for the box of tissues, pulled one out, dipped a corner in a glass of water on the desk, then swept it gently across Aziraphale’s eye. Aziraphale shrunk back, embarrassed. He grabbed the tissue from Crowley’s hand as he did, turned away, and pressed it against his own eye, rubbing hard to clear the mess.🔄  ❓

When he was done. He looked down at the tissue, examining the stains both where it had cleaned his eye, and where it had touched the tips of his fingers. He raised one of his hands once again to examine it closely, and Crowley knew there would be no distracting him from it this time.  
当他完成后，他低头看着纸巾，检查了清洁他眼睛的污渍以及触摸到手指尖的污渍。他再次抬起一只手仔细检查，克劳利知道这次不会有任何东西能分散他的注意力。

“What is it?” he asked. “Will it stop soon?”  
“怎么了？”他问道。“它会很快停止吗？”

“I don’t…” Crowley began, then stopped. Lying wasn’t going to help anything, even if it was done with the best of intentions. He shook his head. “Some kind of ink, I think,” he said. “Demonic aspect. Maybe you’re a squid, I think they release ink…” he tailed off, then grimaced. “No, it won’t stop soon.” He closed his eyes briefly. “Probably not ever.”  
“我不……”克劳利开始说，然后停了下来。撒谎不会有任何帮助，即使出于最好的意图。他摇了摇头。“某种墨水，我想。”他说。“恶魔的特征。也许你是一只乌贼，我想它们会释放墨水……”他说到一半，然后皱了皱眉。“不，它不会很快停止。”他闭上眼睛。“可能永远都不会。”

Aziraphale froze, hand still hovering in the air. He absorbed Crowley’s words, then lowered his hand slowly and took a deep breath. Distress etched its way onto his features. He clasped his hands together, wringing them nervously.  
阿齐拉费尔停住了，手还悬在半空中。他听进了克劳利的话，然后慢慢放下手，深吸了一口气。痛苦的表情浮现在他的脸上。他紧紧地握着双手，紧张地搓动着。

“But… my books. It will ruin all my books.”  
“但是...我的书。这会毁掉我所有的书。”

And his favourite clothes, kept in mint condition for over a century, and his silly magic tricks, and any number of other things that he probably hadn’t even thought of yet. And that, unfortunately, was probably the point. Falling was, after all, a punishment. An unjust one, yes, but a punishment nonetheless. The Fall itself was bad enough, but once it was done, it was done. The memory would linger, but the worst was over. The other effects, the ones that came after, were different for everybody, and they were there so the demons never forgot what they had lost.  
还有他珍藏了一个多世纪的最爱衣物，还有他愚蠢的魔术，以及其他他可能还没有想到的东西。不幸的是，这可能正是问题所在。跌落本身就是一种惩罚。虽然不公平，但仍然是一种惩罚。跌落本身已经够糟糕了，但一旦发生，就发生了。记忆会持续，但最糟糕的已经过去了。其他的影响，发生在之后，对每个人都是不同的，它们存在是为了让恶魔永远不会忘记他们失去了什么。

Not that anybody really needed the reminder of course.  
当然，没有人真的需要这个提醒。

“Some demons think punishments like that are chosen by God herself,” Crowley told him, answering the unspoken question lingering behind the distress in his eyes.  
“有些恶魔认为这样的惩罚是上帝亲自选择的，”克劳利回答了他眼中困扰的无言问题。

Such things had been the subject of much debate in Hell once, aeons ago, before the world had been made, and when demons had little else to do but wallow in their own misery. Crowley had never believed that, though.  
这样的事情曾经在地狱中引起了很多争议，那是无数年前，在世界形成之前，恶魔们除了沉浸在自己的痛苦中几乎没有其他事情可做。不过，克劳利从来不相信这一点。

“But most reckon she wouldn’t want to get her hands dir… uh, to get involved with distasteful stuff like that. Besides, it almost always seems too specific. I think we do it to ourselves. Not deliberately, of course, but I think it comes from inside you. I mean, who else knows what’s going to hurt the most?”  
“但大多数人认为她不会愿意弄脏她的手……呃，参与那种令人讨厌的事情。而且，这似乎总是太具体了。我认为我们是自己给自己找的麻烦。当然，并不是故意的，但我觉得它源自于你的内心。我的意思是，还有谁知道什么会伤害你最深呢？”

Aziraphale lifted his hands again, both palms facing toward him, and spread the fingers. The tips of his fingers, the parts that appeared to be responsible for the black stains, were pink and clean, like some kind of cruel joke, while the palms and the backs of his hands were covered with the marks they had made. “Oh,” he said, quietly.  
亚齐拉费尔再次举起双手，掌心朝向自己，展开手指。他指尖上那些看起来似乎是黑色污渍的部分，却是粉红而干净的，像是某种残酷的玩笑，而掌心和手背则被他们留下的痕迹覆盖着。“哦，”他轻声说道。

Crowley realised at that moment that Aziraphale hadn’t _known_ this was only for him. He thought this happened to every demon for a time. A byproduct of his Fall that would eventually cease.  
克劳利在那一刻意识到，亚齐拉费尔并不知道这只是发生在他身上的事情。他以为每个恶魔都会经历这样的时期。这是他堕落的副产品，最终会停止的。

He watched as the former angel’s heart broke, even as he desperately tried to pretend that it hadn’t.  
他看着这位曾经的天使心碎，即使他拼命试图假装没有发生。

“Okay, look, I know it seems bad, but it’s not the worst thing that could have happened. I mean, you don’t have flies buzzing around your face all the time. Your eyes can still…” he stopped, thinking. “Gloves,” he suggested. “We can get you a pair. You already wear them for your really old books anyway, right? We’ll get you some more. Ones that it can’t seep through. It’ll be fine.”  
“好吧，听着，我知道看起来很糟糕，但这并不是最糟糕的事情。我的意思是，你的脸上不会一直有苍蝇围绕。你的眼睛还能……”他停下来思考。“手套，”他建议道。“我们可以给你买一双。你已经为了你那些非常古老的书戴着手套了，对吧？我们再给你买一些。那种液体不会渗透进去的。没事的。”

Aziraphale looked unconvinced, but nodded anyway. He lowered his hands slowly, bringing them to rest in his lap, then  immediately moved them, leaving behind a greyish mark. He placed them instead on the desk, resting awkwardly with the palms facing upward to avoid any further contamination. He sat like that for a moment, then moved again, settling on a position with hands hovering in the air, touching nothing at all, like a surgeon about to enter the operating theatre.  
亚齐拉费尔看起来并不信服，但还是点了点头。他慢慢地放下双手，放在膝盖上，然后立刻移开，留下了一道灰色的印记。他将双手放在桌子上，手掌向上，避免进一步的污染。他这样坐了一会儿，然后又移动了一下，最后找到了一个手悬空、不接触任何东西的姿势，就像一个即将进入手术室的外科医生。

Crowley reached out and took both of Aziraphale’s hands in his own. Aziraphale flinched, and tried to pull away, but Crowley held on tightly until he stopped struggling and relaxed just slightly. Crowley smiled to himself at the victory, then slowly lifted Aziraphale’s hands toward his lips, and gently kissed the knuckles.  
克劳利伸出手，握住了亚齐拉费尔的双手。亚齐拉费尔畏缩了一下，试图挣脱，但克劳利紧紧地抓住，直到他停止挣扎，稍微放松下来。克劳利对自己的胜利微笑，然后慢慢地将亚齐拉费尔的手举向嘴唇，轻轻地吻了吻指关节。

Aziraphale gasped in horror. “Crowley, please,” he said. “You’re going to get it everywhere!”  
亚齐拉费尔惊恐地倒抽一口气。“克劳利，请你别这样。”他说。“你会把它弄得到处都是！”

“Don’t care.” He let go of one hand and focussed his attention on the other, turning it over, gently caressing the skin as he did. Finally, he raised it one more time and pressed the tips of Aziraphale’s fingers to his lips.  
“不在乎。”他松开一只手，将注意力集中在另一只手上，将其翻转过来，轻轻抚摸着皮肤。最后，他再次抬起手，将亚齐拉费尔的手指尖轻轻贴在嘴唇上。

Aziraphale’s expression morphed from anxiety to confusion, and took that as an indication that he was right. He smiled again. “Watch this,” he said. He took Aziraphale’s hand and gently ran the fingertips over the back of his hand, the one not adorned with black marks from earlier. The touch left light grey smudges, barely noticeable, so feint that if he were not looking for them, he might not have noticed. He knew it wouldn’t be good enough for Aziraphale, and definitely not for his precious books, but it was still a victory.  
亚齐拉费尔的表情从焦虑变成了困惑，他将其视为自己是正确的。他再次微笑。“看着。”他说。他拿起亚齐拉费尔的手，轻轻地将指尖滑过他的另一只手背，那只手上没有早先的黑色印记。这一触摸留下了淡灰色的污迹，几乎不可察觉，如此微弱，以至于如果他不是特意寻找，可能都不会注意到。他知道这对亚齐拉费尔来说还不够好，当然也不适合他珍贵的书籍，但这仍然是一次胜利。

“How?” Aziraphale asked, staring in fascination, Crowley noticed, not at his hand but at his lips.  
“怎么做到的？”亚齐拉费尔问道，他着迷地盯着克劳利的嘴唇，而不是他的手。

“Demonic aspects tend to get more pronounced when you’re under stress,” he said. “So most of the time, it’s probably not going to be as bad as you’re thinking.” He paused, his smile widening into a grin. “And it’s nice to know that I can calm you down,”  
“当你处于压力之下时，恶魔的一面往往会更加明显，”他说道。“所以大部分时间，情况可能没有你想象的那么糟糕。”他停顿了一下，微笑变得更加灿烂。“而且很高兴知道我能让你平静下来。”

Aziraphale took back both of his hands, then stared down at them in something akin to amazement. “You always have done,” he murmured.  
亚齐拉费尔把双手收回，然后惊讶地盯着它们。“你一直都这样，”他低声说道。

The feeling was very mutual. Crowley didn’t bother to tell him so; he was sure that Aziraphale already knew. Instead, he took his angel’s hand in his own again and squeezed gently. “I never told you about the Fall because you never asked,” he said.  
这种感觉非常相互。克劳利没有费心告诉他，他相信亚齐拉费尔已经知道了。相反，他再次握住他天使的手，轻轻地挤了一下。“我从未告诉你有关堕落的事，因为你从未问过，”他说道。

“No, I don’t suppose I ever did,” Aziraphale admitted. “I’m sorry for that.”  
“不，我想我确实从未问过，”亚齐拉费尔承认。“对此我感到抱歉。”

“S’fine. Honestly I didn’t much _want_ to talk about it. I mean, do _you_?”  
“没事。老实说，我也不太想谈论这个。你呢？”

Aziraphale began wringing his hands again. The grey smudges began to darken as the distress rose, and Crowley wished that he could take back the question. Of _course_ he didn’t  want to talk about it. No demon ever did.  
亚齐拉费尔再次握紧了双手。灰色的污迹随着痛苦的上升而变得更加深沉，克劳利希望自己能收回那个问题。当然他不想谈论这个。没有一个恶魔愿意这样做。

“I’m so sorry this happened to you Angel,” he said.  
“我很抱歉这件事发生在你身上，天使。”他说道。

Aziraphale shook his head. “Don’t be. Honestly, it seems fitting that it should finally happen. I’ve been expecting it for a long time. Since the incident with Job. At least now I don’t have to live in fear of it happening anymore.”  
亚齐拉费尔摇了摇头。“别介意。老实说，这似乎是注定会发生的。我早就预料到了。自从与约伯的事件以来，我就一直在害怕它的发生。至少现在我不必再生活在恐惧之中了。”

That was one way to look at it, he supposed.  
那是一种看待问题的方式，他想。

“And anyway, I hardly have the right to feel sorry for myself,” he added. “You see, the thing is, I did it to myself.”  
“而且，我几乎没有权利为自己感到难过，”他补充道。“你看，问题是，这都是我自己造成的。”

“You…” Crowley found himself gripping the sides of his chair tightly in a desperate attempt to hold himself in place as the world appeared to spin tightly on its axis. “What are you talking about?”  
“你……”克劳利发现自己紧紧抓住椅子的两侧，拼命试图保持自己的位置，因为世界似乎紧紧地围绕着自己旋转。“你在说什么？”

“Falling,” Aziraphale told him. He looked down, not able to meet Crowley’s eyes. “It was my own decision.”  
“坠落，”亚齐拉费尔告诉他。他低下头，无法与克劳利的目光相对。“这是我自己的决定。”

Crowley shook his head. “It doesn’t work that way, Angel. You don’t get to choose…” or, did you? Aziraphale had been the Supreme Archangel, after all. If any angel had a say in whether an angel should Fall, it would be him. But nobody had ever chosen to Fall before, and why would they? You would have to be mad to make a decision like that.  
克劳利摇了摇头。“天使，事情不是这样的。你不能选择……”或者，你可以吗？阿齐拉费尔毕竟是至高大天使。如果有任何天使可以决定一个天使是否堕落，那就是他。但是以前从来没有人选择堕落过，为什么会有人这样做呢？你必须疯狂才会做出那样的决定。  
Mad, or desperate. 疯狂，或者绝望。

And with no idea of what it might be like to do so.  
而且对于这样做会是什么样子，他完全没有概念。

A deep sense of guilt began to swell up from somewhere deep inside Crowley, and he shook his head. “Even if you _could_, why would you want to…”  
克劳利内心深处涌起一种强烈的罪恶感，他摇了摇头。“即使你能够，你为什么要这样做呢…”

“I didn’t _want_ to,” Aziraphale interrupted. “It’s just that of the options available to me, that seemed like the least worst. Which isn’t saying much, considering.”  
“我并不想这样做，”阿齐拉费尔打断道。“只是在我可选择的选项中，这似乎是最不糟糕的。虽然这并不值得一提。”

Desperate then, not insane, simply left with no other options. “Right,” he said. “You might have to back up a couple of steps here, because you’ve lost me.”  
绝望而非疯狂，只是别无选择。“好吧，”他说。“你可能需要回过头来解释一下，因为我已经跟不上了。”

“Right. Yes.” Aziraphale began to wring his hands nervously again, then made a visible effort to stop. “I thwarted their plans,” he said. “And they didn’t like it very much.”  
"对，没错。”亚齐拉费尔又开始紧张地揉着双手，然后努力停下来。“我挫败了他们的计划，”他说。“他们对此非常不满。”

Crowley nodded. “No, I don’t suppose they _would_. Thwarted how, exactly?”  
克劳利点了点头。“嗯，我想他们肯定不会喜欢。具体是怎么挫败的？”

“Openly and notoriously,” Aziraphale told him. “Unfortunately there was absolutely no doubt in anybody’s mind that I was the one responsible.” At that, he reached for the box of tissues on the desk, pulled one out and began to toy with it, folding and unfolding it, running it through his fingers, fidgeting without transferring the stains to anything important. If the colour of the marks really _was_ an indication of his emotional state, right now, his stress levels were through the roof.  
“公开而众所周知地，”亚齐拉费尔告诉他。“不幸的是，没有人怀疑我是幕后黑手。”说到这里，他伸手拿起桌上的纸巾盒，拿出一张纸巾玩弄着，折叠、展开，用手指摆弄着，焦躁不安，但并未将污渍弄到任何重要的东西上。如果这些痕迹的颜色真的能反映他的情绪状态，那么现在他的压力已经爆表了。

Crowley reached over and touched him, gripping him on the arm this time. “Okay, so you stopped them. Want to tell me what you did?”  
克劳利伸手过去碰了碰他，这次抓住了他的胳膊。“好吧，你阻止了他们。想告诉我你做了什么吗？”

Aziraphale opened his mouth, then closed it again. He took a deep breath, then exhaled slowly. “Ieditedthebookoflife…” he said, the words garbled and squashed together, spoken so quickly that Crowley could barely make them out.  
亚齐拉费尔张开嘴巴，然后又闭上。他深吸了一口气，然后慢慢地呼出。"我编辑了生命之书..."他说着，话语混乱而拥挤在一起，说得如此之快，克劳利几乎听不清楚。

But he _could_ make them out, and once he had deciphered them, he found himself staring at Aziraphale with a mixture of amazement and disbelief. “You did _what_?”  
但他听清楚了，一旦他解读出来，他发现自己惊讶而难以置信地盯着亚齐拉费尔。“你做了什么？”

“It was just laying around,” Aziraphale said. “It was like they _wanted_ me to mess with it.”  
"它就在那里摆着，"亚齐拉费尔说道。“就好像他们希望我去搞砸它一样。”

“The Book of Life was ‘just laying around’?”  
"生命之书就这样'摆在那里'？"

Aziraphale shrugged. “I mean, it was in a locked safe, in a locked room, on a level that’s only accessible to the very highest ranking of angels,” Aziraphale clarified. He shrugged, and gave a small smile. He was still fidgeting nervously with the tissue, but less frantically now. “But yes, it was just laying there.”  
亚齐拉费尔耸了耸肩。“我的意思是，它在一个上锁的保险柜里，一个上锁的房间里，只有最高级别的天使才能进入的层次，”亚齐拉费尔澄清道。他耸了耸肩，微笑了一下。他仍然紧张地玩弄着纸巾，但现在不那么疯狂了。“但是是的，它就在那里。”

Crowley laughed. He hadn’t meant to, it just happened.  
克劳利笑了。他并不是故意的，事情就这样发生了。

“I didn’t make any _major_ changes,” Aziraphale added. “I just made it so that nobody had any plans for a second coming, or for any other apocalypses for that matter. Unfortunately, it’s not an exact science, and they still remembered that there had _been_ a plan, they just didn’t have it anymore.”  
“我没有做任何重大改变，”亚齐拉费尔补充道。“我只是让没有人计划第二次降临，或者其他任何启示的事情。不幸的是，这不是一门精确的科学，他们仍然记得曾经有一个计划，只是不再拥有了。”

“They wouldn’t like that,” Crowley said.  
“他们不会喜欢那样的，”克劳利说道。

Aziraphale shook his head. “No, definitely not. And to make matters worse, Uriel saw me walking out of the room where the safe was stored, so from there it was very easy for them to figure out what had happened. Which is why the Archangels decided that the best course of action would be to make some changes of their own, and erase me.”  
亚齐拉费尔摇了摇头。“不，绝对不是。更糟糕的是，乌列尔看到我走出保险库的房间，所以他们很容易就能猜到发生了什么。这就是为什么大天使们决定最好的做法是做出一些改变，抹去我的存在。”

“And it never occurred to you to just, I don’t know, erase Uriel, or Michael. Or the Metatron, or just the whole lot of them?”  
“你从来没有想过，只是，我不知道，抹去乌列尔，或者迈克尔。或者梅塔特隆，或者他们所有人吗？”

“Certainly not,” Aziraphale said.”  
“当然不是，”亚齐拉费尔说。

Crowley nodded. “Didn’t want to be responsible for killing an angel?”  
克劳利点了点头。“不想为杀死一个天使负责？”

“Oh, it wasn’t that,” Aziraphale insisted. “It’s just that the consequences would have been too far-reaching. Michael, for example, was the one who stationed me on Earth in the first place. If not for her, another angel might have been chosen, and I never would have met you.”  
“哦，不是那样的，”亚齐拉费尔坚称道。“只是后果会太过深远。比如，迈克尔是第一个派遣我到地球上的人。如果不是她，可能会选择另一个天使，我就永远不会遇到你。”

Oh. Well when he put it like _that_…  
哦，好吧，他这么说的话...

“So they put me on trial,” Aziraphale said.  
“所以他们对我进行了审判，”亚齐拉费尔说。

Crowley scowled. He had witnessed three trials in Heaven in his time, and not one of them had been what he would have called fair.  
克劳利皱了皱眉头。他在天堂见过三次审判，没有一次是他认为公正的。

“Well, of a sort,” Aziraphale said. “There was nobody to defend me, and I didn’t have the opportunity to defend myself either. Mostly, it was just the Archangels debating about what to do with me, while I had to stand there and watch. They tried to decide between erasure from the Book of Life, and a memory wipe. They settled on the memory wipe eventually, although Michael wasn’t too happy about it. They planned to invent a new lowest rank, and demote me to it, then put me to work. They claimed it was an act of mercy, but I got the feeling they just wanted to be able to gloat over what they’d done to me.”  
“嗯，算是吧，”亚齐拉费尔说。“没有人为我辩护，我也没有机会为自己辩护。主要是大天使们在辩论该怎么处理我，而我只能站在那里看着。他们试图决定是从生命之书中抹去我的存在，还是擦除我的记忆。最后他们选择了擦除记忆，尽管迈克尔对此并不太满意。他们计划创造一个新的最低级别，将我降级并让我工作。他们声称这是一种仁慈的行为，但我感觉他们只是想炫耀他们对我的所作所为。”

Crowley nodded grimly. That sounded about right. “So how’d you end up… you know…”  
克劳利默默点头。听起来差不多就是这样。“那你是怎么最后……你知道的……”

”Fallen?” “堕落”的？

Crowley tried his best not to react to the word. He had never wanted this for Aziraphale. He had never even _imagined_ that it might happen. Someone like him wasn’t meant for that life.  
克劳利尽力不让自己对这个词有任何反应。他从未希望亚齐拉费尔会有这样的结局。他甚至从未想过这可能会发生。像他这样的人并不适合那种生活。

“That’s the thing,” Aziraphale told him. “Technically, I didn’t actually fall. I jumped.”  
“就是这样，”阿齐拉费尔告诉他。“从技术上讲，我并没有真正摔下来。我是跳下去的。”

Well, he had said that he had done it to himself. The end result was still the same, of course, and he doubted it would have any kind of softening effect on the moment of impact.  
嗯，他说过他是自己做的。当然，最终结果还是一样的，他怀疑这不会对冲击的那一刻产生任何缓解的效果。

“I tricked them,” Aziraphale said, eyes smiling with a kind of gleeful amusement now. “I asked for a moment to pack my books away for shipment back to Earth. After all, they wouldn’t want any material objects laying around up there after I was gone. The thing is, they seemed to have forgotten that I hadn’t actually taken any books with me up there. I used the time to escape, but I didn’t see any other way out. They could still wipe my memory, and they could still delete me from the Book of Life, if they chose. But for some reason, it was still laying around in the same place.”  
“我欺骗了他们，”阿齐拉费尔说道，眼睛中透着一种愉快的笑意。“我请求他们给我一点时间，把我的书打包寄回地球。毕竟，他们不会希望我离开后还有任何物质存在在那里。问题是，他们似乎忘记了我并没有真正带任何书上去。我利用这段时间逃脱了，但我没有看到其他出路。他们仍然可以抹去我的记忆，仍然可以从生命之书中删除我，如果他们选择的话。但出于某种原因，它仍然留在同一个地方。”

“Inaccessible floor, locked room, locked safe?”  
“无法进入的楼层，上锁的房间，上锁的保险箱？”

“Exactly, and I was still technically the Supreme Archangel at that point, so there was nothing to stop me. I went and got it, and then I took it with me to the roof, where I made a very conscious and apparently binding decision, and, well… Jumped.” He stopped at that point, as though he had suddenly run out of words. He slumped in his chair. “I suspect you know the rest,” he added.  
“没错，那时我还是最高大天使，所以没有什么能阻止我。我去拿到了它，然后带着它上了屋顶，在那里做出了一个非常自觉且显然具有约束力的决定，然后...跳下去了。”他停在那里，好像突然没有话可说了。他在椅子上垂头丧气地坐着。“我猜你知道接下来的事情，”他补充道。

Crowley found himself staring at the… former angel in awe. Aziraphale looked back with an expression that mingled horror and pride at what he had done, underneath it all, the small lines around his eyes spoke of lingering pain from the Fall. It would fade in time, but he would always carry the memory of it with him.  
克劳利惊奇地盯着这个...前天使。阿齐拉费尔回望着他，表情中既有恐惧又有骄傲，他所做的事情在其中，而他眼角的细纹则流露出从堕落中残留的痛苦。这种痛苦会随着时间的推移而消逝，但他将永远携带着这段记忆。

“You’re amazing,” Crowley told him.  
“你太了不起了，”克劳利告诉他。

Aziraphale smiled again, and for a moment, everything else disappeared and that smile was the only thing in the room. “Oh, hardly,” he said, waving a black and grey stained hand dismissively through the air. “I’m sure anybody would have done the same.”  
阿齐拉费尔再次微笑，一切似乎都消失了，只剩下他的微笑在房间里。“哦，不值一提，”他挥了挥沾满黑灰的手，不以为意地说道。“我相信任何人都会做同样的事情。”

Oh they most definitely would not. In fact he was fairly sure that Aziraphale _himself_ only a couple of years earlier would not.  
哦，他们绝对不会这样做的。事实上，他相当确定亚齐拉费尔本人几年前也不会这样做。

“You saved the world all on your own,” Crowley told him. “And then you…” Jumped down into Hell itself, finally turned his back on Heaven with no way to go back. “What happened to the book though?” he asked, as the thought occurred. It must have survived. After all, the world was, as far as he was aware, unchanged. All those names contained within its pages had not been snuffed out when Aziraphale had taken his leap.  
“你独自拯救了世界，”克劳利告诉他。“然后你……”跳进了地狱本身，最终背弃了天堂，再也无法回头。“不过书呢？”他问道，这个念头突然出现在他脑海中。它一定还存在着。毕竟，据他所知，世界没有发生任何改变。当亚齐拉费尔跳下去时，书中的那些名字并没有被抹灭。

Aziraphale smiled again. “It’s fine. It’s invulnerable to destruction, you see.” Carefully, using his knuckles rather than the tips of his fingers, he pulled back one side of his jacket and nodded down at a pocket stitched into the lining. “Would you be a dear? I daren’t touch it in this state, I wouldn’t want to accidentally obscure any information and obliterate an entire chapter of history.”  
亚齐拉费尔再次微笑。“没关系。它无法被摧毁，你知道。”他小心翼翼地用指关节而不是指尖拉开了夹克的一侧，点头示意内衬上缝制的一个口袋。“你能帮个忙吗？我不敢在这种状态下碰它，我不想意外地遮挡任何信息，抹去整个历史的一章。”

“You’re kidding, right?” Crowley asked, knowing that he wasn’t.  
“你在开玩笑，对吧？”克劳利问道，明知道他不是在开玩笑。

“Just inside the pocket,” Aziraphale told him.  
“就在口袋里面。”阿齐拉费尔告诉他。

Crowley reached carefully into the pocket, fingers trembling as he did. There was a small item contained within. He took hold of it carefully and pulled it out. “_This_ is the Book of Life? It’s more like a pamphlet or something. How does _this_ contain the entire history of every human, angel and demon ever to have existed.” He frowned. “Oh no, it’s one of those ‘bigger on the inside’ things, isn’t it? I _hate_ stuff like that.”  
克劳利小心地伸手进口袋，手指颤抖着。里面有一个小物件。他小心地抓住它，拿了出来。“这就是生命之书？更像是一本小册子或者什么的。这怎么可能包含了每个人类、天使和恶魔的整个历史。”他皱了皱眉。“哦不，这是那种‘里面比外面大’的东西，是吧？我讨厌这种东西。”

Aziraphale shook his head. “It’s not technically a material object,” he said. “Which means it can be any size. In the safe in Heaven it was quite a hefty tome, but I needed something that wouldn’t be noticed in Hell, I couldn’t risk it falling into _their_ hands, and so…”  
阿齐拉费尔摇了摇头。“它并不是一个实体物体，”他说。“这意味着它可以是任何尺寸。在天堂的保险柜里，它是一本相当厚重的书，但我需要一样在地狱里不会被注意到的东西，我不能冒险让它落入他们的手中，所以……”

“So we end up with the Leaflet of Life.” Crowley placed it carefully on the desk, where it immediately began to grow in size until it resembled a small hardback novel. He glanced at Aziraphale. “Did you do that?”  
“所以我们最后得到了生命传单。”克劳利小心地把它放在桌子上，它立刻开始变大，变成了一本小型精装小说的样子。他看了一眼阿齐拉费尔。“是你做的吗？”

“No, it did it to itself. Adapting to its surroundings, perhaps. Would you put it somewhere please? We need to keep it out of Heaven’s hands.”  
“不，它是自己这么做的。也许是为了适应周围环境。你能把它放在某个地方吗？我们需要把它藏起来，不让天堂得手。”

Crowley glanced around the shop. “Where? Do you have a safe hidden around here, Angel? Or maybe a hollowed out book that used to contain a Derringer?”  
克劳利环顾四周的店铺。“放在哪里？你这里有个保险箱藏在哪里吗，天使？或者说，你有一个挖空的书本，里面曾经放着一把小型手枪？”

“It still _does_,” Aziraphale told him. “No, I was thinking just on one of the shelves, or maybe with the stacks of unshelved books, it is a bookshop after all, it should blend in nicely. A needle in a haystack, so to speak.”  
“它还在这里，”阿齐拉费尔告诉他。“不，我只是想放在书架上的某个地方，或者放在未上架的书堆中，毕竟这是一家书店，应该能很好地融入其中。就像大海捞针一样。”

Crowley thought about it. He was right, of course. He picked up the book, glanced quickly around the shop, then walked decisively to a random corner and inserted it among the others. “Right then,” he said. “They’ll be coming for it, you know. Soon as they find out you’re not in Hell they’re going to figure out it’s here.”  
克劳利考虑了一下。他当然是对的。他拿起那本书，迅速环顾了一下店铺，然后果断地走到一个随机的角落，将它插入其他书中。“好了，”他说。“他们会来找它的，你知道的。一旦他们发现你不在地狱，他们就会知道它在这里。”

“I’m going to change the warding on the shop,” Aziraphale told him. “I thought it might be pertinent to prevent unauthorised angels from entering as well as demons. And I was thinking perhaps we could do one of our half miracles, to hide the book, when…” he winced. “When I’m feeling more like myself. I’m not sure I could miracle up a cup of tea right now.”  
“我打算改变店铺的警戒措施，”阿齐拉费尔告诉他。“我觉得防止未经授权的天使和恶魔进入可能是相关的。而且我在想，也许我们可以做一个半个奇迹，把书藏起来，当……”他皱了皱眉。“当我感觉更像自己的时候。我现在不确定我能否奇迹般地泡一杯茶。”

Demonic miracles came from another source than Angelic ones, and it would take time before Aziraphale learned how to wield his power again, but he would get there.  
恶魔的奇迹来自于另一个源头，阿齐拉费尔需要时间才能再次掌握自己的力量，但他会做到的。

“Tell me,” Aziraphale said, still wincing deeply as though the attempt to reach for his power had wounded him deeply. “Is the pain at least temporary?”  
“告诉我，”阿齐拉费尔说着，仍然深深地皱着眉，仿佛试图触及他的力量已经深深地伤害了他。“这种痛苦至少是暂时的吗？”

Crowley crossed the room again in seconds, “It is,” he assured him. Exactly _how_ temporary, he wasn’t sure, but it _was_ temporary, the burns would heal, he knew that much. “Is it bad?”  
克劳利几秒钟内再次穿过房间，“是的，”他向他保证道。具体有多暂时，他不确定，但是它是暂时的，烧伤会愈合，他知道这一点。“痛得厉害吗？”

Aziraphale considered the question, then shook his head. “Compared to just after it happened? No. It’s just, I’ve never really experienced pain before. I didn’t realise what it was like.”  
亚齐拉费尔考虑了一下这个问题，然后摇了摇头。“和刚刚发生的时候相比呢？不，只是我以前从未真正经历过痛苦。我不知道那是什么感觉。”

“Anything I can do?” he asked.  
“有什么我可以做的吗？”他问道。

“Maybe just be here with me,” he said.  
“也许只是陪在我身边就好了。”他说道。

He could do that. Crowley sank back into his chair and edged it a little closer to Aziraphale’s. He reached out and took Aziraphale’s hand in his own, and held it tightly. “Hey,” he said. “You never finished the story. You landed in Hell, right? How’d you end up back here?”  
他可以做到。克劳利沉入椅子，将椅子稍微靠近亚齐拉费尔。他伸出手，紧紧握住亚齐拉费尔的手。“嘿，”他说。“你从未完成那个故事。你降落到地狱了，对吧？你是怎么回到这里的？”

“Oh,” Aziraphale smiled again. “Yes, well they let me go. Marched me to the lift and put me in themselves, actually.”  
“哦，”亚齐拉费尔再次微笑着。“是的，他们让我走了。亲自把我带到电梯里。”

Crowley frowned. “Just like that?”  
克劳利皱了皱眉。“就这样？”

“They didn’t exactly trust me. I mean, I can hardly blame them, a Former Supreme Archangel, suddenly showing up in the middle of Hell. I think they thought I was a spy for the other side.”  
“他们并不完全信任我。我是说，我也不能怪他们，一个前最高天使突然出现在地狱中间。我想他们可能以为我是对方的间谍。”

Crowley raised an eyebrow.  
克劳利挑了挑眉毛。

“I know, me! A spy for Heaven! Can you imagine?”  
“我知道，我！一个为天堂工作的间谍！你能想象吗？”

He couldn’t. He couldn’t imagine anybody volunteering for that job. Perhaps _technically_, with his back against the wall, Aziraphale had chosen to Fall over two alternate versions of oblivion, but he couldn’t imagine any angel, even the most brainwashed and compliant, voluntarily submitting themselves to that.  
他无法想象有人会自愿选择那份工作。或许从技术上讲，当阿齐拉费尔背水一战时，他选择了堕落，但他无法想象任何天使，即使是最受洗脑和顺从的天使，也会自愿接受那样的工作。

Although, now he thought about it, he _had_ fairly recently seen a recording of Gabriel appearing very happy at the prospect of making the transition to Hell. Something told him he might have felt different if he had actually _done_ it, and he was quite sure that any angel that did fall, even with the most Heavenly of intentions, would not want to work for Heaven anymore once they landed.  
不过，现在他想起来，他最近看到过一段录像，盖布里埃尔在转投地狱的前景下显得非常开心。他觉得如果自己真的这样做了，他可能会有不同的感受，而且他非常确定，任何堕落的天使，即使怀着最神圣的意图，一旦降临地狱，也不会再想为天堂工作了。

Secretly though, he thought that Gabriel might have made a decent demon. It would have been interesting to see what happened if he _had_ taken the leap. And it certainly would have saved him and Aziraphale a lot of trouble.  
不过，他私下里觉得盖布里埃尔可能会成为一个不错的恶魔。如果他敢跳下去，会发生什么将会很有趣。而且这肯定会为他和阿齐拉费尔省去很多麻烦。

“Crowley?” “克劳利？”

Crowley shook the thought loose from his head and focussed once again on Aziraphale. “You love spy books,” he said. “And what about all that stuff you got up to during the 40s? If I was going to choose an undercover angel to send into Hell, it’d be you. No doubt about it.”  
克劳利摇了摇头，再次专注于亚齐拉费尔身上。“你喜欢间谍小说，”他说。“还有你在40年代做的那些事情呢？如果我要选择一个潜入地狱的天使，那肯定是你。毫无疑问。”

Aziraphale beamed. 亚齐拉费尔笑容满面。

“Just out of interest,” Crowley added. “You wouldn’t happen to have done or said anything to… encourage them in that thought, would you, Angel?”  
“只是出于好奇，”克劳利补充道。“你不会做或说什么来……鼓励他们有那种想法，对吧，天使？”

“Well…” Aziraphale said, looking more than a little pleased with himself. “I suppose I _might_ have.”  
“嗯……”亚齐拉费尔自得地说道。“我想我可能会。”

Crowley grinned. He couldn’t even imagine how much strength it would have taken to create a pretence like _that_ so soon after falling. He felt a deep sense of pride at the thought. “So, you’re a free agent,” he said.  
克劳利咧嘴一笑。他无法想象在跌落后不久就能制造出这样一个伪装需要多大的力量。他对此感到无比自豪。“所以，你是个自由人，”他说。

Aziraphale looked as though the thought hadn’t even occurred to him. As Crowley watched, several emotions flickered across his face in quick succession, finally settling on uncertainty. “I suppose so, for now. Though I imagine sooner or later Hell might figure out the truth. They talk to each other, you know. Back channels. I mean, I knew it was going on of course, but I didn’t realise the _extent_ of it until recently.”  
亚齐拉费尔看起来好像从未想过这个问题。当克劳利看着他时，他的脸上闪过几种情绪，最终停留在不确定上。“我想，至少现在是这样。虽然我想迟早地地狱会发现真相。他们之间有联系，你知道的。秘密渠道。我是说，我当然知道这种事情一直在发生，但直到最近我才意识到它的程度。”

“Yeah, I know. They also don’t trust each other. Some angel tells their contact in Hell that their Supreme Archangel threw himself down into the pit just to get away from them, do you really think they’re going to believe it? Not assume it’s some kind of ploy? Plus with Beelzebub gone, I bet Hell’s is even more of a shambles than it already was. They were the only one holding it together.”  
“是的，我知道。他们也不信任彼此。有些天使告诉地狱的联系人，他们的至高大天使为了逃离他们而跳进深渊，你真的认为他们会相信吗？不会认为这是某种诡计吗？再加上贝利尔走了，我敢打赌地狱现在比以前更加一团糟。他们是唯一能维持秩序的人。”

“Well then,” Aziraphale said, still looking a little uncertain, but slightly less so than before. “I suppose I am free. For now, at least.”  
“那么，”亚齐拉费尔说，看起来还有些不确定，但比之前稍微好一些。“我想，至少现在我是自由的。”

For now. And that was really all they could hope for. For the time being, neither Heaven nor Hell wanted anything to do with either of them, and they were both free.  
就现在而言。这就是他们能够期望的一切。暂时来说，无论是天堂还是地狱都不想与他们有任何关系，他们都是自由的。

“I’m a demon,” Aziraphale said, as though testing out the word.  
“我是个恶魔，”亚齐拉费尔试探性地说道。

The last time Crowley had heard him say that had been thousands of years ago, by a large rock overlooking the sea in the land of Uz. There had been terror and distress in his voice then, he had been so certain that a single lie could trigger a fall, and that Crowley had been there to take him to Hell. Now, his voice still trembled slightly at the words, but there was an undercurrent of confidence that Crowley appreciated.  
克劳利上次听到他说这话已经是几千年前了，在乌兹之地的一块大石头旁边，俯瞰着大海。那时他的声音中充满了恐惧和痛苦，他非常确定一句谎言就能引发堕落，而克劳利就在那里把他带去地狱。现在，他的声音在这些话语中仍然微微颤抖，但克劳利能感受到其中的自信。

He cleared his throat and tried again, turning to look at Crowley this time as he did. “I’m a demon,” he said again, and actually smiled.  
他清了清嗓子，再次尝试，这次他转过身来看着克劳利。“我是个恶魔，”他再次说道，并且真心地微笑了一下。

Crowley rolled his eyes. Trust Aziraphale to be having _fun_ right now.  
克劳利翻了个白眼。相信阿齐拉费尔现在正玩得开心。

“Yeah, you and me both,” Crowley told him.  
“是啊，你我都一样，”克劳利告诉他。

“What am I supposed to do now?” Aziraphale asked, and Crowley genuinely couldn’t tell whether it was a question that needed an answer, or a purely rhetorical one.  
“现在我该怎么办？”阿齐拉费尔问道，克劳利真的无法确定这是一个需要回答的问题，还是纯粹的修辞问句。

He sighed. “Recover, first,” he said. “Then the same thing you’ve always done. Nothing’s changed, not really.”  
他叹了口气。“首先要恢复过来，”他说。“然后做你一直以来做的事情。实际上，什么都没变。”

“Oh, I disagree,” Aziraphale told him. “I don’t particularly want to do the same things I’ve always done.”  
“哦，我不同意，”阿齐拉费尔告诉他。“我并不特别想做我一直以来做的事情。”

Crowley raised an eyebrow. “No? What are you thinking, going to start fermenting discord and ill-will among the good people of Soho?”  
克劳利挑了挑眉。“不是吗？你在想什么，要开始在苏豪区制造纷争和恶意吗？”

Aziraphale looked horrified at the suggestion. “Certainly not!” he said. “No, I was thinking more of the situation between you and I. Before I left, you… said some things. I don’t want to presume that you still feel the same way. After all, I know my leaving wasn’t ideal. I really didn’t _want_ to go, but I know it must have hurt you, especially with the timing being what it was, and with what I tried to offer you, but…”  
阿齐拉费尔听到这个建议后，露出了恐惧的表情。“当然不是！”他说。“不，我是在考虑你和我之间的情况。在我离开之前，你……说了一些话。我不想假设你现在还有同样的感觉。毕竟，我知道我离开并不理想。我真的不想走，但我知道这一定伤害了你，尤其是在那个时机下，还有我试图给你提供的东西，但是……”

“Angel,” Crowley said, stopping the torrent of words before it could become a flood  
“天使，”克劳利说着，阻止了这股滔滔不绝的话语。

Aziraphale blinked. “Demon,” he said.  
亚齐拉费尔眨了眨眼睛。“恶魔，”他说。

“Yeah, I’m not going to start calling you that,” Crowley assured him. He leaned forward, taking both of Aziraphale’s hands in his own again, and staring into his eyes, hoping to convey exactly what he was feeling. “Like I said, _nothing’s changed_. That includes how I feel about you.”  
“是的，我不会开始叫你那个名字的。”克劳利向他保证。他向前倾身，再次握住亚齐拉费尔的双手，凝视着他的眼睛，希望能传达出自己的真实感受。“就像我说的，没有什么改变。包括我对你的感觉。”

Aziraphale took a moment to absorb that, a relieved expression filled his face, followed by pure joy. “Oh, well…” he said. “I’m very glad to hear it.”  
亚齐拉费尔花了一会儿时间来接受这个事实，他的脸上充满了宽慰的表情，接着是纯粹的喜悦。“哦，那么……”他说。“我很高兴听到这个。”

Crowley waited, still holding onto Aziraphale’s hands, for him to say it back. He didn’t. Instead, he appeared to grow uncomfortable, as though he didn’t know what he was supposed to do now.  
克劳利等待着，仍然握着亚齐拉费尔的手，期待他回应。但他没有。相反，他似乎变得不舒服，好像不知道接下来该怎么做。

He cleared his throat. “Were you wanting another kiss?” he asked. “I’m afraid you took me rather by surprise the last time, and I’d never done it before. I’m sure you’re a bit of an expert, but I’m not exactly sure _how_ to…”  
他清了清嗓子。“你想再亲一下吗？”他问道。“上次你突然亲我，我有点措手不及，而且我以前从来没有这样做过。我相信你是个专家，但我不太确定该怎么做……”

Crowley laughed and shook his head. “My first one too,” he admitted.  
克劳利笑了笑，摇了摇头。“我也是第一次，”他承认道。

“Really? But you’re a demon, and temptations were your literal job description. I’d have thought seduction was an integral part of that.”  
“真的吗？但你是个恶魔，引诱是你的工作描述。我本以为诱惑是其中不可或缺的一部分。”

“Nah,” Crowley shook his head. “I’ve never been any good at that side of things.”  
“呃，”克劳利摇了摇头。“我在这方面从来不擅长。”

Aziraphale shook his head. “Oh, I think I would have to disagree with you there,” he told him.  
亚齐拉费尔摇了摇头。“哦，我得不同意你的说法，”他告诉他。

Crowley grinned. “Yeah, well, I’d say I made an exception for you, but the whole thing took me by surprise too.”  
克劳利咧嘴笑了。“是啊，嗯，我可以说我对你做了个例外，但整件事也让我感到意外。”

Aziraphale frowned. “It wasn’t a surprise to me.”  
亚齐拉费尔皱了皱眉。“对我来说并不意外。”

“It wasn’t?” “不是吗？”

Aziraphale shook his head. “Well, that you decided to say it out loud, yes. The rest, not so much.”  
亚齐拉费尔摇了摇头。“嗯，你决定大声说出来，是的。其他的，不太确定。”

“Wait…” Crowley frowned. “How long?”  
“等等……”克劳利皱了皱眉。“多久了？”

“Have I known how you felt?”  
“我知道你的感受有多久了吗？”

He nodded. 他点了点头。

Aziraphale looked thoughtful for a moment. “That’s not an easy question to answer. It happened gradually, as these things tend to do. And you know, I had an advantage, because angels can sense love…” He broke off, suddenly looking deeply sad. “It was like a lovely warm blanket that I could surround myself with on a chilly evening. I’m going to miss that a great deal. Probably more than anything else.”  
亚齐拉费尔沉思了片刻。“这不是一个容易回答的问题。它是逐渐发生的，就像这些事情通常会发生的那样。而且你知道，我有一个优势，因为天使能感知爱……”他突然停下来，脸上露出深深的悲伤。“它就像一件可爱的温暖毯子，在寒冷的夜晚里我可以裹在身上。我会非常想念它，可能比其他任何事情都要多。”

“Hey, don’t… it’s still there,” Crowley told him.  
“嘿，别……它还在那里，”克劳利告诉他。

Aziraphale took a deep breath. “I know.”  
亚齐拉费尔深吸了一口气。“我知道。”

Crowley stood and offered a hand to Aziraphale. Aziraphale hesitated before taking it and allowing Crowley to gently help him to his feet. Once he was standing, Crowley wrapped his arms around him, squeezing gently. He brushed his fingers across the former angel’s cheek, then planted a gentle kiss there. “I'll just have to find other ways to make sure you can sense it,” he whispered.  
克劳利站起身，伸出手给亚齐拉费尔。亚齐拉费尔犹豫了一下，然后接过他的手，让克劳利轻轻地帮他站起来。一旦他站稳了，克劳利将双臂环绕着他，轻轻地拥抱着。他用手指轻抚着这位曾经的天使的脸颊，然后在那里轻轻地亲吻。“我只需要找到其他方法，确保你能感受到它，”他低声说道。

Aziraphale smiled. “I think I might enjoy that,” he told him.  
亚齐拉费尔微笑着说：“我想我会喜欢那个。”他告诉他。
