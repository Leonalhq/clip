### Chapter Text

The angel hurried through the garden, carefully pushing aside branches and peering into clearings.

Anyone nearby might have heard the constant muttered, “Damn, damn, damn, damn…”

Finally, he found what he was looking for.

“Er…”

The huge snake was sprawled in a lazy heap in a patch of sunlight near The Tree. It was massive, cream and fawn dappled with gold and black, though its eyes were a pale and astonishingly clear blue. They were also fixed on the angel.

The angel cleared his throat. “Look, I need you to…” He jerked the big stick in his hand in the direction of the Eastern gate.

The blue eyes blinked slowly and the snake’s tongue flicked out.

The angel fidgeted. Did giant demonic snakes even use words? Must do, he reasoned. S’how they talked to other demons. “You know you aren’t meant to be here anyway.”

With clear reluctance and indignation, the snake’s coils unfurled and contracted and all at once, a cream-winged demon was lounging on the ground, giving him a sardonic look. He was plump and pink-cheeked, his hair shockingly white. “Bit late for guard duty now, isn’t it?” he said.

The angel glared at him. “You didn’t really _help_ matters.”

The demon shrugged, smoothing down his tunic. It was ridiculously elegant, the angel noticed enviously. Deep shades of golden brown, embroidery glittering like coiled scales. “You know what it’s like. Boss says jump, you say how high.” He grinned slowly, rolling his shoulders. “I mean, there were guards and everything, weren’t there?”

The angel clenched his hands by his side. “Look,” he said again, trying to keep his tone even. “You’ve made a mess of everything! And if you’re still here when–”

The demon laughed. “_I_ made a mess of everything?” He grinned. “I just told them the fruit looked tasty. _I_ didn’t tell them not to eat it.”

The angel opened and shut his mouth a couple of times. He had wondered about that. Why put the tree in the garden at all? And why specify they couldn’t eat from that one particular tree? Why not put it somewhere far off where it wouldn’t be the easiest thing in the world to get to? And why–

“Why’ve’you got a stick?” the demon inquired.

The angel’s mental meanderings crashed to a halt. “What?”

“The stick.” The demon nodded to the stick in his hand. “Shouldn't you have a flaming sword?”

The angel looked down at the stick in his hand. It was almost as long as the sword, but nowhere near as pointy or flamey. “Er…”

The demon sat forward, a wide grin splitting his face. “You _lost_ it?”

“No!” The angel exclaimed hotly. “I didn’t!”

The demon clapped his soft hands together, laughing. “You _did_!”

“I– it–” The angel wrapped his other hand around the stick. “Um. I gave it away.”

The grin froze on the demon’s face, his brow creasing. “You… what?”

And the angel couldn’t stop himself from babbling. The humans, they’d eaten the stuff they shouldn’t have and well, they couldn’t stay… well, not in the garden, and they were cold and he didn’t know how to knit them anything or weave or _anything_ useful, so he’d done the next best thing and gave them something to keep them warm in the big wide world. I mean, who wouldn’t? Isn’t that what he was meant to do? Look after them? Who would care? No one! Not really! Not at all! So wasn’t it all for the best?

The demon stared at him, round-eyed.

The angel clung onto his stick. “Why are you staring?”

The demon’s lip curled up, but it wasn’t a smirk this time. “Not what I expected, angel,” he said. “D’you have a name?”

The angel did, of course, but that was for the Heavenly hosts, and this was earth. Better to have a more earth-bound name. “Er.”

“Er?” The demon smiled. “Easy to remember that.”

“No! Um!” He cast about frantically and saw one of the birds hopping along the branches of the garden. It was the same colour has his wings. “Crow-ly.” He nodded. “Crowley. Is me.”

The demon rolled to his feet. Somehow, he still managed to move like a snake, even with six extra limbs. He shook out shimmering gold and cream feathers. “Aziraphale,” he said, then looked up, alarm visible in his eyes when there was a crashing sound from the sky.

“What on earth…?” Crowley spun around, staring up through the trees. The sky was turning darker and blacker and he could smell water in the air. “Oh! Oh no!” He ran across the gap between himself in the demon, flinging his wings up over it. “Don’t move!”

The demon’s face was so close to his and he could see the gleaming blue was framed by darker blue like… like…

A crack of white fire tore across the sky.

Like _that_.

Around them, water started falling from above and the demon flinched closer to him. Crowley closed his wings over them both as the water – rain, his brain informed him. New, very exciting – fell around them.

The demon tilted his head, watching him. “Giving away swords and playing at umbrellas,” he said with a small, crooked smile. “Didn’t see that coming.”

Crowley frowned at him. “What’s an umbrella?”

The demon huddled closer to him under his wing. “Not a sodding clue.”

### Chapter Text

The clouds were getting darker by the minute and Crowley couldn’t stop pacing.

Technically, technically, it was right. It _was_. The orders came from… on high. That meant they had to be right, didn’t it? You couldn’t go around questioning the Great Plan. And God had the authority to make the decisions. That was– it was– surely that meant it was… right? Surely!

But…

He looked across the plain to the giant wooden ship and the procession of pairs of animals.

But…

He knocked his knuckles together, staring worriedly up at it, then turned and paced back and forward a few more times.

People were gathering nearby, a lot of them laughing. Some of them had just come along to see animals they’d never seen before. Noah and his lads had a pretty extensive list, but hadn’t learned about natural selection or inbreeding or anything, which could be a problem, but surely, that had been accounted for as well? Why save them and then give them useless animals that would be too inbred to do anything within a couple of generations?

He spun back again, pushing through the people. He didn’t want to be there. He didn’t want to have to watch, but he had _orders_ and you had to obey them, didn’t you? He’d been doing it for so long, biting his lip and not asking all the questions filling up his head and–

A flash of glittering gold in the crowd caught his attention and he frowned, pushing his way towards it.

A very familiar demon was sitting by a firepit, licking grease from his fingers and watching the procession of animals with interest. Feathers blazed around the fire and something was glowing down at the heart of the flame.

“Aziraphale?”

The demon looked up with a grin. “Crowley, isn’t it?” He waved a welcoming hand, beckoning the angel closer, and proffered a dripping drumstick, seared on the flames. “Fancy trying it?”

Crowley stepped back, wrinkling his nose. Human foods had never really appealed to him. “No. Thank you.”

Aziraphale gave a lazy shrug. “Suit yourself.” He tore a hank out of the meat, and grinned. “Never thought I’d get a chance to try phoenix. They’re damned tricky to cook, if you don’t take them apart before they go in the fire.”

Crowley stared at him. “You _ate_ Noah’s phoenix?”

The demon shrugged again. “Didn’t have his name on it.” He waved the dripping bone around. “Is that who’s behind all this, then? Noah?”

“Yes.” Crowley glanced back at the ark. “Look, you really shouldn’t be here.”

The demon chuckled. “Play a new record.” He tossed the bone into the flame where it burst into shimmering sparks. “Said that in the garden too.”

“No!” Crowley hurried over and crouched down beside him. “No, you don’t understand. There– God– it’s all…” He shook his head, words getting all tangled up. How to explain without letting all his doubt and questions come bubbling to the surface! “Big flood coming. _Big_ one. Wipe out humanity kind of thing!”

Aziraphale stared at him. “A flood?” He glanced in the direction of the boat. “Ohhhh.” A dark look crossed his face. “Playing favourite again, are they?”  

“Favourite?” Crowley echoed, confused.

The demon nodded towards the boat. “Picking and choosing who gets to stay and who gets to…” He snorted in disgust, scrambling to his feet with more grace than he had any right to have. “How many?” His voice was sharper than Crowley had ever heard it. “How many get to go in that?”

Crowley fidgeted. “Well, there’s Noah, his sons, their wives and families…”

“Boat that big and maybe a dozen going on it?”

“It’s–” Crowley’s throat felt tight. “It’s the plan.”

“The plan.” The demon didn’t even look at him. “_What_ plan?”

Crowley shrugged helplessly. “I don’t know,” he admitted.

“So, for some… ineffable reason, a family gets a nice pleasure cruise with their own petting zoo while everyone they ever knew gets left behind to drown?  _Lovely_.” There was something bleak in the demon’s expression, his pale eyes darkening.

Crowley hesitated, then cautiously touched his elbow. “Are– are you all right?”

Aziraphale rolled his head from side to side, his neck crackling, looking uncannily serpent-like. “Of course.” He flashed a grin that wasn’t very convincing. “Why wouldn’t I be? The more souls damned, the better it looks for my paperwork.”

A peal of thunder shook the earth and Crowley looked up, the first drops of rain pattering on his face. By the time he looked back around, Aziraphale was gone.

### Chapter Text

The pain hanging in the air of the place was almost unbearable.

It… couldn’t be right. It couldn’t.

And yet, she was under orders to perform no miracles. It wasn’t allowed. It was all Part of the Plan. Gabriel was very specific about it. She’d asked why and the other angels had looked at her so coldly that she’d recoiled, smiled and clenched her fingers against her hands until her palms bled.

Crowley drew the headscarf closer around her face, covering the loose curls of her hair.

His followers were fewer, scared off by their leader’s fate. Many couldn’t come. The men at least. All of the women were there. It was… easier to be there among them as a woman. No one questioned it. No one gave a second glance. And they all felt exactly the same way she did. Knowing the sharp bitter sting of betrayal and disbelief wasn’t hers alone helped.

She felt the ripple in the air and turned to see a familiar face and pale blue eyes fixed on the bloody man nailed to the cross. He couldn’t be here for any good reason, but it’s a Heaven-sanctioned event. Maybe he’d come to interfere.

Crowley almost cursed, crushing down the small spark of hope that maybe he might do _something_.

But he didn’t.

He stood and he stared and, concerned and curious, she moved a little closer.

“Don’t even say it,” Aziraphale growled, his teeth sharper than usual.

Crowley flinched. “Say what?”

“That I’m not supposed to be here.” The demon’s robes were more ornate than ever, jewels stitched into the fine fabric now, seed pearls and glittering topaz in scaly, twisting patterns. Nothing like Crowley’s own shawl and gown. Only Aziraphale’s feet were covered in dust, and so were the ends of his clothes. He normally made such an effort to look elegant. “Should’ve known you’d be hanging around to enjoy another of your little good deeds.”

Crowley stared at him, stung. “I don’t get a say in what does and doesn’t happen, Aziraphale.” The demon’s lip curled, but he didn’t look away from the mortal. There was a look in his eyes, something Crowley couldn’t quite grasp. “Did… did you meet him?”

“Yes.” Aziraphale’s expression softened and he laughed, sadly. “Silly little bastard was thin as a rake and he wouldn’t even take food when I offered him a feast. Not even a piece of bread. He–” He sighed. “The holiest ones are always the most stubborn.”

Crowley nodded, moving a little closer to the demon, quietly relieved she wasn’t the only one to think so. “They are,” she agreed quietly.

The demon glanced around, a frown furrowing his brow. “What did he do anyway? Why did they put him up there? He didn’t seem the type to cause any trouble.”

Crowley looked up at the young human. Dark blood was dripping onto the sand below, staining it black. “It’s what he said.”

“Oh?”

She turned back to the demon with a sad smile. “Be kind.”

The understanding, grief and exasperation that flitted across Aziraphale’s face was far too familiar.

“Ah,” he said gloomily. “That would do it.”

### Chapter Text

Aziraphale yawned, scratching his fingers through his curls as he strolled down the steps from the palace and towards the nearest inn.

Inspiring lust was all well and good, but at an orgy, it wasn’t as if he was really needed. Still, at least it had a buffet. Why they’d served the seafood on the backs of kneeling slaves, he couldn’t understand. Some of it was best served cold, not at human body temperature.

He felt the eyes on him as soon as he entered and grinned. Mortals were so easy, especially if you flashed your wealth around. He could feel the warm lap of covetousness against his senses, some for his fair skin and hair, some for his glittering necklace and one for…

He glanced around the inn, spotting the human in question and curled his lips back from his teeth. The surge of lust heightened and he prompted it a little higher, dragging his tongue along his upper lip. Well, perhaps, not a total loss of a day after all.

A drink, first, and then maybe the little human might need a little more… indulgence.

He was halfway to the bar when he picked up the prickle of something divine and looked around, puzzled. A skinny figure was stooped over at the far end of the bar, a shabby toga trailing almost to the floor, ragged red hair in wisping curls around its shoulders.

That hair…

He’d’ve known that hair anywhere. Should’ve been longer, long enough to sink fingers into and fist and pull, but now, it was cropped short, as raggedly as the slaves in the marketplace.

“Crowley?”

The angel looked up, bleary-eyed, and Aziraphale stared at him astonishment. The god-damned angel was drunk. He had a clay cup in his hand and he was swaying and he was _drunk_.

Aziraphale dragged up a stool without conscious thought, sitting down beside the angel. “What the hell’s the matter with you?”

The angel screwed up his face, shaking his head slowly as if it might roll off his shoulders, and reached for a pitcher to refill his cup. “Nothing. S’fine. S’all fine. Why wouldn’t it be?” He gave a short, bitter laugh that sounded like it might turn into tears. “S’always fine, the plan. Always.”

Well. Shit.

Aziraphale caught the barkeep’s attention, calling for something stronger and better than the piss the angel was clearly drinking. “In town on business, then?”

Crowley nodded, his whole body rocking with the movement of his head. “Don’t know what they’re expecting me to do.” He turned wide brown eyes on Aziraphale. “I try so hard, y’know, and they’re… they’re…” He shook his head again.

“Human?” Aziraphale suggested with a crooked smile.

The angel shrugged, glowering into his drink. “Do as you’re told,” he mumbled to himself. “Part of the plan. All part of the plan.” He swung around suddenly, leaning in close to the demon. “Do _you_ know what the plan is? Does anyone? No! S’bloody plan and no one has a blueprint to show me and I don’t and you don’t and it’s… it’s…” He hiccupped, then blinked. “Oh.”

Aziraphale hesitated, then patted him awkwardly on the shoulder. “It’s above our pay grade. Not worth bothering about, eh?”

“Not worth…” The angel stared at him as if he’d grown a second head. “Who says? Come down here, they said. Take care of the humans, they said. Take care, but don’t care. Oh, no. Don’t do that. Stupid, that. Don’t ask. Stop asking. Stupid question. Stupid angel. Stupi–” He smacked Aziraphale on the chest, which had about as much effect as a water balloon on a submarine, then fell sideways into him. “Stupid angel,” he mumbled, muffled in Aziraphale’s chest.

The demon wrapped his hands around the angel’s shoulders, helping to sit up again. “I don’t think you’re stupid,” he said.

“Ha!”

“I don’t.” He met the angel’s eyes with a crooked smile. “A bit soft, perhaps, but you’re an angel. It happens.”

Crowley blinked at him slowly, then narrowed his eyes. “Why’re you being… nice to me?”

Aziraphale snorted. “This isn’t nice,” he retorted. “This is you ruining the mood in this place and me not being able to do my job. If you cheer up, I can get on with my work.”

Brown eyes blinked at him slowly. They had little gold flecks in them, he noticed. Like embers in a banked fire. “You,” the angel said resolutely, wagging a finger at him, “are lying.”

“Yeah,” Aziraphale said, grinning at him. “And? It’s what I do.”

The angel went almost cross-eyed trying to make sense of it. “Oh. Right. Yeah.” He sniffed hard, then rubbed his nose with the back of his hand.

Aziraphale studied him. Crowley looked more down than he had in the handful of years since they’d seen each other. He’d been upset at… that incident in Jerusalem. Probably shook him up a bit. Why wouldn’t it? No one wanted to be on the murder side, did they? Well, apart from some of the more unpleasant demons he knew.

“Tell you what,” he said, “I’m popping down to Petronius’s new tavern.”

The angel squinted at him. “What for?”

He leaned closer, giving the angel a seductive grin. “Care to try some oysters?”

The angel made a face, sticking his tongue out. “I’d rather go to bed,” he declared, making Aziraphale’s brain slam to a halt. He got unsteadily to his feet, swaying so much that Aziraphale had to put out a hand to steady him. Those big ember-filled eyes shone up at him. “You _are_ being nice to me.” He gave him a shy smile. “That’s my job.”

Aziraphale snorted. “Oh, do shut up, angel.” He slid his arm under the angel’s shoulder. “Let’s get you to bed.”

### Chapter Text

“Hello?”

Aziraphale groaned, cracking an eye open. “What now?”

One of Mordred’s men scurried in from their position outside his tent. “It looks like an emissary from Camelot, my Lord. He’s been wandering around outside the camp for a while now.”

The demon rolled his eyes. Of course. Holier than Thou Camelot wouldn’t like to have people going against their precious rules, would they? Even if those precious rules seemed to be pretty damned flexible for a certain King’s knights.

“Fine,” he grumbled, rolling off the comfortable arrangement of cushions in his tent. It took the snap of his fingers for his armour to manifest over his snug tunic, although it chaffed something awful. He gestured with a hand. “Helmet.”

The young soldier eagerly obeyed. Wasn’t a bad time to be around, all things considered. The humans were rather more accepting of magic, which meant he didn’t have to waste time or energy masking it from them.

He set the helmet on, snapping the visor down. “Righto. Lead on.”

Outside the tent, the world was grey and dreary, reduced down to vague shapes and outlines. The ground underfoot was sopping wet and Aziraphale made a face. As soon as he could find somewhere with a nice fire and a decent cup of mead, he was going to sit there and dry himself out properly and bugger anyone who asked otherwise.

“Hello?” The voice had taken on a hopeful note. Not really surprising. The poor bastard could probably hear him clanking from fifty paces. “Hello! I’m looking for the Black Knight!”

Aziraphale paused where he was. He knew that voice. “Crowley?” He clanked a little further forward until a pale shape slowly emerged from the fog. “Is that you?”

The shape was a knight in very shiny armour with feathery white fluff clinging to the shoulders. The owner flipped up his visor, a smile lighting up his face. “Aziraphale! What are you doing here?”  
那个形状是一个穿着闪亮盔甲的骑士，肩膀上还附着着白色的绒毛。主人翻起面甲，脸上露出了笑容。“阿齐拉费尔！你在这里做什么？”

Aziraphale stared at him then looked down at his black armour. “I’ll give you three guesses.”  
亚齐拉费尔盯着他看，然后低头看着自己的黑色盔甲。“我给你三次猜测的机会。”

Crowley blinked at him. “Oh. OH!” He pointed at the armour, then back at Aziraphale, then back at the armour. “_You_’re the Black Knight?”  
克劳利瞪大眼睛看着他。“哦。哦！”他指着盔甲，然后指向阿齐拉费尔，再指向盔甲。“你就是黑骑士？”

“I know,” Aziraphale said, tilting up his own visor. “So cliché. I tried to tell him the colour hardly matters, but no, no, no. No one tells his young Lordship anything like that.”  
“我知道，”亚齐拉费尔说着，抬起自己的面罩。“太陈词滥调了。我试着告诉他颜色并不重要，但是，不，不，不。没人敢对他的贵族少爷说这样的话。”

“But… but why?” The angel seemed baffled.  
“但是...为什么呢？”天使似乎感到困惑。

“Really?” Aziraphale raised his eyebrows. “You come from Camelot, home of all things, good, true and hypocritical, and you wonder why I’m here? You’re doing too much good. My lot can’t have that.”  
"真的吗？"亚齐拉费尔挑起了眉毛。“你来自卡美洛特，一切善良、真实和伪善的家园，你还想知道我为什么在这里吗？你做得太多善事了。我的团队可不能容忍这样。”

“Ah.” Crowley winced. “Yes. Well…” He frowned again. “Wait. What do you mean hypocritical?”  
“啊。”克劳利皱了皱眉。“是的。嗯……”他再次皱起眉头。“等等。你说的虚伪是什么意思？”

Aziraphale waved the thought away. “Nothing. Never mind. It’s typical, though, isn’t it? Both of us in the same damp, miserable little place.”  
亚齐拉费尔挥了挥手，将这个念头抛之脑后。“没什么，别介意。不过，这很典型，对吧？我们俩都在这个潮湿、糟糕的小地方。”

The angel nodded, glancing around. “Is it _always_ like this?”  
天使点了点头，环顾四周。“这总是这样吗？”

“Mostly.” Aziraphale studied him. “And us wasting our time like this as well…”  
"大部分是。”亚齐拉费尔注视着他。“而我们也在这样浪费时间…”

“We’re not wasting our time!” Crowley said defensively.  
“我们不是在浪费时间！”克劳利辩解道。

“You do a good deed, I do a bad deed? Comes to a grand total of nothing for either side. Basic mathematics, my dear.” Aziraphale adjusted his armour again with a wince. “We’d be better off not bothering at all.”  
“你做好事，我做坏事？最后对双方都没有任何意义。亲爱的，这是基本的数学。”亚齐拉费尔带着痛苦地调整着他的盔甲。“我们最好干脆不去理会。”

The angel’s lips moved. He was thinking. He did that a lot, Aziraphale had noticed, as if he was going through a checklist, validating everything that was said to him, verifying it, and then making a choice about an answer.  
天使的嘴唇动了动。他在思考。亚齐拉费尔注意到，他经常这样做，好像在进行一份清单，验证每一句对他说的话，然后做出选择并给出答案。

“We can’t _not_ do our duty,” he finally said, though he sounded a little more thoughtful than he had. A chink in his proverbial armour that Aziraphale was more than willing to pry open.  
“我们不能不履行我们的职责。”他最终说道，尽管他听起来比之前更加深思熟虑。这是阿齐拉费尔乐于揭开的他的一处明显的弱点。

“Does it matter? Evil and good? Both done or undone, it’s a zero sum result.”  
有关系吗？邪恶和善良？无论是做还是不做，结果都是零和游戏。

Another pause, while Crowley did his mental calculations. “Wouldn’t they check? Your people? Mine–” There was something in the way his breath hitched that caught the demon’s attention. “I mean, Gabriel. He’s... I think he would check.”  
克劳利心算了一会儿，又停顿了一下。“他们不会查吗？你们的人？我的人——”他呼吸突然停顿的方式引起了恶魔的注意。“我的意思是，加百列。我觉得他会查的。”

Aziraphale shrugged. “You can still send the paperwork. I’ll tell you what I’m not doing and you do the same for me. We can report on the wiles you thwarted and no one will ever know the difference and we can be home for suppertime.”  
亚齐拉费尔耸了耸肩。“你仍然可以寄送文件。我会告诉你我不会做什么，你也可以告诉我同样的事情。我们可以报告你挫败的诡计，没有人会察觉到差异，我们还能在晚餐时间回家。”

The angel stared at him. “But– isn’t that–I shouldn’t–” He backed up a step, shaking his head. “No. No. We can’t.”  
天使盯着他看。“但是——那不是——我不应该——”他退后了一步，摇着头。“不行。不行。我们不能这样做。”

“We can, though.” 我们可以的。

“No!” The angel retreated another step. “I– look, I didn’t come here to get into semantics.”  
“不！”天使又退了一步。“我——看，我不是来这里纠缠于语义的。”

Aziraphale took a lazy step towards him. “No. You’re here to thwart me, my dear. I’m simply offering to save you the effort and the soggy underthings. No price. No cost. Only a little more time for you to do good where and when you choose.”  
亚齐拉费尔懒洋洋地朝他走了一步。“不，亲爱的，你是来阻挠我的。我只是提供帮助，省去你的麻烦和湿漉漉的内衣。没有代价，没有费用。只是多给你一点时间，让你在你选择的地方和时间做些好事。”

That indecision in those brown eyes was tantalising, then Crowley set his jaw. “No. Thank you.” He bowed, oddly and a bit stiffly. “If you don’t mind…” He turned and clanked back off into the fog.  
那双棕色眼眸中的犹豫令人心动，然后克劳利咬紧了嘴唇。“不，谢谢。”他奇怪地、有些生硬地鞠了一躬。“如果你不介意的话……”他转身在雾中咣当咣当地离开了。

“The offer still stands!” Aziraphale called after him. “I can wait!”  
“还是有这个优惠！”亚齐拉费尔在他走后大声喊道。“我可以等！”

If the angel said anything in response, he didn’t hear it.  
如果天使有回应，他没有听到。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Crowley couldn’t remember the last time he’d been to the south bank of the city. Generally, if he had to meet up with his… associate, they found some kind of neutral spot in a park. He tried to stay closer to the hub around St. Paul’s as an anchor and a reminder of what he was there to do.  
克劳利已经记不清上次他去过城市的南岸是什么时候了。通常，如果他不得不与他的…伙伴会面，他们会在公园里找到一个中立的地点。他试图保持靠近圣保罗大教堂周围的中心地带，作为一个锚点和提醒他在那里要做的事情。

Of course, sometimes an anchor came loose and that was why he was hurrying across the bridge towards the hive of theatres and gaming dens and taverns. His destination was a white-washed round building, a stone’s throw from the river.  
当然，有时候锚会松动，这就是他匆忙穿过桥向剧院、赌场和酒馆密集的地方赶去的原因。他的目的地是一座白色的圆形建筑，离河边只有一箭之遥。

To his surprise, he was waved through the doors at once by a bored-looking boy, but as soon as he entered the theatre, he could see why: the place was almost empty, except for a couple of people in the seats and – of course – Aziraphale in all his opulent glory only a few feet from the stage. Honestly, with the amount of gold threading in his clothing and the size of his purse, he was just asking for trouble.  
令他惊讶的是，一个看起来厌倦的男孩立刻向他招手让他通过门口，但是一进入剧院，他就明白了原因：这个地方几乎空无一人，除了几个坐在座位上的人，当然还有阿齐拉费尔，他身穿华丽的服装，身上金线闪闪发光，钱袋也很大，简直是自找麻烦。

And, again, it was no surprise to see the demon plucking grapes from a cloth in his hand and popping them in his mouth.  
而且，再次看到恶魔从手中的布料上摘下葡萄，放进嘴里，这一点并不令人惊讶。

Crowley glanced around warily, but as far as he could sense, there was no divine interference, so he hurried closer. “You said we’d blend in with the crowds!” he whispered accusingly, as soon as he reached the demon. “That’s the only reason I agreed to come!”  
克劳利警觉地四处张望，但据他所感知，没有神圣的干涉，所以他匆忙靠近。他一到达恶魔身边，就低声指责地说：“你说我们会和人群融合在一起！”“这是我同意来的唯一原因！”

Aziraphale gave him a sunny smile. “But we couldn’t miss Burbage’s new role.”  
亚齐拉费尔露出了一个阳光般的微笑。“但我们不能错过伯贝奇的新角色。”

Crowley stared at him, then up at the young man on the stage. “That’s it? That’s the reason you got me all the way over here?”  
克劳利盯着他，然后抬头看着舞台上的年轻人。“就这样？这就是你把我从那么远的地方带过来的原因？”

The demon shrugged, holding out his little cloth of grapes to Crowley. “Well, two birds and one stone, wouldn’t you say?”  
恶魔耸了耸肩，将他手中的一小块葡萄递给克劳利。“嗯，一箭双雕，你说呢？”

Crowley tried to glare at him, which only made the demon grin even more, pale eyes dancing. “So what are you up to?” he asked, folding his arms over his chest, feeling woefully underdressed, his doublet and hose plain and serviceable black with white beneath.  
克劳利试图瞪他一眼，这只让恶魔更加咧嘴笑了起来，苍白的眼睛闪烁着。"你在搞什么鬼？"他问道，双臂交叉在胸前，感觉自己穿得太过朴素，他的上衣和裤子都是朴实无华的黑色，里面是白色。

The demon gave a snake-like wiggle of satisfaction. “The usual.” He held up his empty hand to stop Crowley from speaking as another man approached. “William, _darling_, this may be one of your best.”  
恶魔满意地扭动着蛇一般的身躯。“照常。”他举起空空的手，示意克劳利别说话，因为另一个男人走了过来。“威廉，亲爱的，这可能是你最棒的之一。”

The human beamed proudly. “I’m glad you think so, Ezra. I only wish more people did.” He glanced back at the stage. “Do you mind being… a little more vocal?”  
人类自豪地笑了笑。“我很高兴你这么认为，埃兹拉。只是希望更多的人也能这样想。”他回头看了看舞台。“你介意表达得再明确一点吗？”

“You know I always am,” Aziraphale purred and Crowley had to look away, flushing.  
“你知道我一直都是这样的。”亚齐拉费尔轻声说道，克劳利不得不移开视线，脸红了起来。

“Oh, tush!” Shakespeare snorted, but he sounded pleased. Crowley cautiously looked back at them in time to see the fond smile on the writer’s face. “You know what I mean, you filthy creature. Poor Burbage works best with a responsive audience.”  
“哦，胡说八道！”莎士比亚嗤笑道，但他听起来很高兴。克劳利小心翼翼地回头看着他们，正好看到作家脸上的亲切笑容。“你知道我是什么意思，你这个下流的家伙。可怜的伯贝奇需要一个积极的观众。”

Aziraphale patted his arm. “Of course, my dear.” His eyes danced. “But you know you need only ask if you require more… vocal stimulation of your own.”  
亚齐拉费尔轻拍了他的胳膊。“当然，亲爱的。”他的眼睛闪烁着。“但你知道，如果你需要更多的...声音刺激，只需开口提出要求。”

If Crowley was pink, then Shakespeare was shading towards scarlet, his eyes darting between the demon and Crowley. The poor human stammered out a few words of apology to Crowley, then hurried back towards the edge of the auditorium.  
如果克劳利是粉红色的，那么莎士比亚就偏向深红色，他的眼睛在恶魔和克劳利之间忙碌地扫视着。可怜的人类向克劳利结结巴巴地道了几句歉意，然后匆忙回到礼堂的边缘。

“Do you always have to tease them like that?” Crowley muttered, giving him a stern look.  
“你总是要这样取笑他们吗？”克劳利嘟囔着，严厉地瞪了他一眼。

The demon slanted a look at him. “Who said I was just teasing?”  
恶魔斜了他一眼。“谁说我只是在逗你玩？”

Crowley sputtered, swatting his arm. “Aziraphale!”  
克劳利咕哝着，挥手拍打着自己的胳膊。“阿齐拉费尔！”

Aziraphale laughed. It was a big, warm sound and he nodded towards the stage. “Just a minute. I need to pay attention.”  
亚齐拉费尔笑了笑。那是一个大而温暖的声音，他向舞台点了点头。“等一下，我需要集中注意力。”

The young man was performing a soliloquy and despite himself, Crowley listened. Shakespeare _did_ have a way with words, there was no denying it, and while Aziraphale was crying out enthusiastic interjections, he listened to what was being said.  
这个年轻人正在独白，克劳利不由自主地倾听着。莎士比亚的文字确实有一种独特的魅力，不可否认。而阿齐拉费尔则兴致勃勃地发出赞叹，但他也在倾听着所说的话。

An elbow in the ribs brought him back to reality. “Enjoying it?” Aziraphale inquired, looking pleased.  
一肘撞在他的肋骨上，将他带回了现实。“喜欢吗？”亚齐拉费尔询问道，看起来很高兴。

Crowley nodded, his mouth dry and his eyes surprisingly damp. Something about the speech had struck a chord, though he couldn’t work out why. “It’s no little thing to make my eyes sweat compassion.”  
克劳利点了点头，嘴巴干燥，眼睛出奇地湿润。演讲中的某些内容触动了他的心弦，尽管他无法理解为什么。“让我的眼睛流泪同情可不是小事。”

A smaller and somehow more genuine smile slipped across Aziraphale’s face. “I knew you’d like it,” he said, then popped another grape in his mouth. He offered the pouch again, shrugging when Crowley waved it away.  
阿齐拉费尔的脸上露出了一个更加真诚的微笑。"我知道你会喜欢的，"他说着，然后又塞了一颗葡萄进嘴里。他再次递给克劳利那个袋子，但克劳利摆了摆手，示意不要了。

“Why did you want me to come anyway?” Crowley asked. “I mean, apart from…” He motioned to the stage.  
“你到底为什么要让我来？”克劳利问道。“我是说，除了……”他指了指舞台。

“Well, it seems I need to go to Edinburgh next week.” The demon made a face. “Why the clans can’t leave one another’s cattle alone for five minutes, I don’t know, but apparently, one of them needs to be urged to do some rustling.”  
“嗯，看来下周我需要去爱丁堡。”恶魔皱了皱眉。“为什么这些家族不能让彼此的牲畜安安静静地待上五分钟，我不知道，但显然，其中一个需要被敦促去做点偷牛的事情。”

Crowley eyed him. “That doesn’t sound too difficult.”  
克劳利盯着他。“听起来不太困难。”

“I know.” Aziraphale gave him a convincingly innocent wide-eyed stared. “Any chance you’re heading north any time soon?”  
“我知道。”亚齐拉费尔以一种令人信服的天真无辜的眼神看着他。“你有没有什么机会很快就要往北走？”

He tried to look stern, but with the demon batting his eyelashes like a milkmaid, his lips twitching, it was almost impossible. “Actually, yes.” He held up a finger. “For a blessing. That’s all. Nothing else.”  
他试图显得严肃，但是那只妖魔眨着眼睛像个牛奶女工，他的嘴唇抽动着，几乎是不可能的。“实际上，是的。”他举起一根手指。“只是为了祝福。仅此而已。”

He almost missed the tiny roll of Aziraphale’s eyes. “Oh come on, my dear. What’s the point of _both_ of us trekking all the way up there and all the way back, when you know it would only take the one of us to do the jobs?”  
他几乎错过了阿齐拉费尔微微翻白眼的动作。"哦，亲爱的，别这样。我们两个都去那里再回来有什么意义呢？明明只需要一个人去完成这些任务就可以了。"

Crowley bit his lip. Not again. Every time, _every time_, they’d met like this before, he’d told himself it would be the last time. “I told you before that I wouldn’t do it again.”  
克劳利咬了咬嘴唇。又来了。每一次，每一次，他们像这样相遇之前，他都告诉自己这将是最后一次。“我之前告诉过你，我不会再做了。”

Aziraphale slid a little closer to him. “And then,” he reminded him, with that warm, winning smile, “you did it anyway. What’s one more time?”  
亚齐拉费尔离他近了一点。“然后，”他提醒他，带着温暖而迷人的微笑说，“你还是做了。再来一次又有何妨？”

It was the same argument they had every time and he was right. Crowley squeezed his arms, trying to glare at the demon, which only made Aziraphale widen his eyes in wounded innocence.  
每次都是同样的争论，他是对的。克劳利紧紧地握住他的胳膊，试图瞪着那个恶魔，这只让阿齐拉费尔更加无辜地睁大了眼睛。

“Oh, all right, fine,” he snapped, groping in his coin purse. “Toss you for Edinburgh.”  
"哦，好吧，行了，"他咕哝着，摸索着他的钱袋子。"抛硬币决定去爱丁堡吧。"

Aziraphale gave him the filthiest of leers. “Oh, you’d like that, wouldn’t you?”  
亚齐拉费尔露出了最肮脏的媚笑。“哦，你会喜欢的，不是吗？”

“Stop that!” Crowley flapped a hand, shooing him back a step. “Not that kind of… tossing. Honestly, you’re terrible.” He tried to glare again, but the demon was giggling, dimples popping in his cheeks, and Crowley couldn’t help the rueful smile that crept onto his lips. “You really _are_, though. I don’t know why I put up with you.”  
“别闹了！”克劳利挥了挥手，把他赶到一边。“不是那种……扔的意思。老实说，你真是太糟糕了。”他试图再次瞪他一眼，但恶魔却咯咯笑着，脸颊上凹陷出可爱的酒窝，克劳利不禁露出了苦笑。“不过你确实是这样。我不知道为什么我还忍受你。”

Aziraphale flung an arm around his shoulders. “Charm! Wit! A marvellous personality!”  
亚齐拉费尔一把搂住他的肩膀。“魅力！机智！一个了不起的个性！”

“And an overactive imagination,” Crowley retorted before he could stop himself, then clapped his hand to his mouth.  
“还有一个过于活跃的想象力。”克劳利不由自主地反驳道，然后迅速捂住了嘴巴。

“_Angel_!” Aziraphale managed to sound both appalled and delighted. “You just _insulted_ me! All by yourself!”  
“天使！”亚齐拉费尔声音中既有愤怒又有喜悦。“你刚刚侮辱了我！完全是靠你自己！”

Crowley knocked the demon’s elbow with his. “Oh, shut up.” He fumbled with the coin, tossing it and slapping it down on the back of his hand. “Call?”  
克劳利用他的手肘碰了一下那个恶魔的手肘。“哦，闭嘴。”他摸索着硬币，将其抛起并拍在手背上。“叫牌吗？”

“Tails,” the demon said, leaning closer to peer at it. Crowley uncovered the coin and Aziraphale whined. “But I don’t _want_ to go to Edinburgh. It’s so _far_.”  
“尾巴，”恶魔说着，靠近一点去看。克劳利揭开了硬币，阿齐拉费尔发出了哀鸣。“但我不想去爱丁堡。太远了。”

Crowley patted him consolingly on the shoulder. “Is there anything I can do for you here, while you’re away?”  
克劳利安慰地拍了拍他的肩膀。“你离开的时候，我能在这里帮你做些什么吗？”

As if he had been cued, Aziraphale’s latest… friend sighed, “It’d take a miracle to get anyone to come and see Hamlet.”  
仿佛得到了提示一样，亚齐拉费尔的最新朋友叹了口气，“要想有人来看《哈姆雷特》，简直需要奇迹。”

The demon’s eyes lit up and he looked hopefully at Crowley.  
恶魔的眼睛亮了起来，满怀希望地望着克劳利。

Crowley glanced at the stage and the young man. A line from his speech was ringing in Crowley’s ear: Thus conscience does make cowards of us all. He turned back to Aziraphale and smiled. “Well, _obviously_, but I meant for your side of things.”  
克劳利扫了一眼舞台和年轻人。他脑海中响起了演讲中的一句话：“因此，良心使我们所有人都变成懦夫。”他转身回到阿齐拉费尔身边，微笑着说道：“嗯，显然，但我是指你这边的事情。”

“Oh! Right!” Aziraphale scratched his chin thoughtfully. “You wouldn’t… take care of William for me?” The glint in his eye gave him away. “He needs a very thorough… taking care of.”  
"哦！对了！"亚齐拉费尔有些思索地挠了挠下巴。“你能……替我照顾一下威廉吗？”他眼中闪烁的光芒透露了他的真实意图。“他需要非常细致的照顾。”

“Really, Aziraphale?” Crowley said, giving him a stern look. “_Really_?”  
“真的吗，亚齐拉费尔？”克劳利严肃地说道，目光严厉。“真的吗？”

The demon wrinkled his nose, barely hiding a grin. It was ridiculous how disarming it was. “Worth a try, eh?” He shrugged. “I’m sure you’ll find something. Hang around on this side of the river long enough and something’ll turn up.”  
恶魔皱了皱鼻子，勉强掩饰住笑容。这种情景实在是太令人难以抵挡了。“试试看，嗯？”他耸了耸肩。“我相信你会找到些什么的。在这一边的河边逗留足够久，总会有机会出现的。”

Later, as Crowley walked back across the bridge, he smiled to himself as he turned a young pickpocket’s attentions to the purse of a very elegantly-dressed, wealthy, man-shaped person who had just come out of the Globe theatre and was on his way to dinner. He wondered if Aziraphale would appreciate the joke.  
后来，克劳利走过桥时，他对自己微笑着，将一个年轻的扒手的注意力转移到了一个刚从环球剧院出来准备去吃晚餐的穿着非常优雅的富有的人身上的钱包上。他想知道阿齐拉费尔是否会欣赏这个笑话。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

"You could've let me finish," Aziraphale complained as he was bundled through the gloomy corridors of the prison. "Have you any idea how hard it is to find decent crepes? And they had honey!"  
“你本可以让我说完的。”阿齐拉费尔抱怨道，他被人拖着穿过阴暗的监狱走廊。“你知道找到好吃的可丽饼有多难吗？而且它们还有蜂蜜！”

"Shut up, aristo!" One the guards struck him hard across the shoulders with a crop and the demon froze, giving him a long, measured look. The man stared back at him rudely and all it took was a little rooting in his mind...  
"闭嘴，贵族！"其中一名卫兵用鞭子狠狠地抽打了他的肩膀，恶魔停下了动作，用一种冷静而深思熟虑的眼神看着他。那个男人粗鲁地盯着他，只需要稍微搜索一下他的思维...

"Now that was rather silly, wasn't it, Pierre?" He took a step closer to the man. “Madeleine was so proud of you, wasn’t she? What _will_ she think of you now?” He tsked, shaking his head. “Oh, I think we both know why she left, don’t you?”  
“那真是太愚蠢了，不是吗，皮埃尔？”他向那个男人走近了一步。“玛德琳曾经对你非常骄傲，不是吗？现在她会怎么看待你呢？”他嘴里发出一声唏嘘，摇着头。“哦，我想我们都知道她为什么离开了，不是吗？”

Pierre looked as if he'd swallowed his tongue, but his compatriot didn't seem to notice.  
皮埃尔看起来好像噎住了舌头，但他的同胞似乎没有注意到。

"Allez," he said, pushing Aziraphale onwards.  
"走吧，"他说着，推着阿齐拉费尔前进。

There were several cells in the chamber, divided by bars, and Aziraphale was relieved to see third time was indeed the charm. Wide brown eyes stared across at him in dismay as he was bundled into one of the empty cages.  
在房间里有几个由铁栏杆分隔的牢房，阿齐拉费尔松了口气，因为第三次终于如愿以偿。茫然的宽大棕色眼睛注视着他，当他被塞进其中一个空的笼子里。

Thankfully, the angel waited until their gaolers stamped out and slammed the door behind them before rushing to the bars. "Aziraphale! You shouldn't be here!"  
幸运的是，天使等到狱卒们走远并在他们身后砰地关上大门后才急忙赶到铁栏前。“亚撒瑞尔！你不应该在这里！”

The demon snorted. "Coming from the angel in a cage, that's rich." He dusted himself down with a flick of his fingers. “What on earth are you doing here, my dear? I doubt there’s much place for miracles in a time like this.”  
恶魔哼了一声。“从一个关在笼子里的天使嘴里说出来，真是够丰富的。”他用手指轻轻拍了拍身上的灰尘。“亲爱的，你在这里做什么呢？我怀疑在这样的时代，奇迹并没有多大的空间。”

To his amusement, the angel went as red as his hair. “Er…” He had his hands wrapped around the bars and seemed very, very interested in them. “Well. No. Not _officially_.”  
令他感到有趣的是，那位天使的脸红得和他的头发一样。"嗯..."他双手紧紧抓住铁栏杆，似乎对它们非常、非常感兴趣。"嗯，不，正式来说不是。"

Aziraphale stared at him. “You came to Paris. In the middle of a bloody revolution. To perform unauthorised miracles.”  
亚齐拉费尔盯着他看。“你来到巴黎。在一场血腥的革命中。进行未经授权的奇迹表演。”

“Don’t say it like that!” Crowley said indignantly. “They were just… sort of… redistributed from people who could afford it.”  
“别那样说！”克劳利愤怒地说道。“它们只是从有能力的人那里‘重新分配’而已。”

“I see.” Aziraphale couldn’t help smiling. The damned angel probably didn’t even realise how far he was straying into rogue territory. Heaven always had their favourites and if he was taking the miracles rightfully meant for them…  
“我明白了。”亚齐拉费尔忍不住笑了起来。这该死的天使可能甚至没有意识到自己已经偏离了正道。天堂总是有他们的宠儿，如果他拿走了本应属于他们的奇迹...

Thoughts slid into place.  
思绪迅速归位。

“Ohhh,” he said with a nod. “That’s why you’re still sitting in here, isn’t it? You can’t perform any extra miracles in case they pick up on them?”  
“哦，”他点头说道。“这就是你还坐在这里的原因，对吧？你不能表演任何额外的奇迹，以免他们察觉到？”

“Mm. Gabriel sent me a rude note the other week about getting… carried away.” The angel’s lips thinned to an unhappy line. “I don’t know what all the fuss is about!” he exclaimed. “It’s not as if I’m _not_ doing the miracles. Isn’t that all that matters?”  
“嗯。上周加百列给我发了一封粗鲁的便条，说我...有点过火。” 天使的嘴唇紧抿成一条不开心的线。“我不知道这到底是怎么回事！”他愤然说道。“我又不是没有做奇迹。难道这不是最重要的吗？”

“You’d think so,” the demon said consolingly, “but then Heaven does spend a lot of time speaking out of its backside, doesn’t it?”  
“你会这样想的，”恶魔安慰地说道，“但是天堂确实经常从屁股说话，不是吗？”

“Aziraphale!” Crowley glared at him. “You _can’t_ say things like that!”  
“亚齐拉费尔！”克劳利怒视着他。“你不能说那样的话！”

Aziraphale raised his eyebrows. “Why?”  
亚齐拉费尔挑起了眉毛。“为什么？”

Crowley gaped at him, opening and shutting his mouth a few times. “Because–” he sputtered. “Because… because you _can’t_.”  
克劳利目瞪口呆地看着他，嘴巴张开又闭上了几次。“因为——”他结结巴巴地说道。“因为...因为你不行。”

Aziraphale spread his hands, chains jingling, and grinned. “Demon. If I can’t say it, no one can.”  
亚齐拉费尔伸开双手，铁链叮当作响，咧嘴一笑。“恶魔，如果我不能说出来，就没有人能说出来。”

“Oh for Heaven’s sake…” Crowley huffed, then took a quiet breath. “What are you doing here anyway? You can just…” He made a flourish with one hand that made his shackles clatter. “I mean, you don’t need to be here.”  
“哎呀，天哪……”克劳利嘟囔着，然后轻轻地吸了口气。“你到底在这里干什么？你可以……”他用一只手做了个夸张的手势，让他的镣铐发出咔嗒声。“我的意思是，你不需要在这里。”

The demon snorted. “Three damned arrests before I manage to find you and you tell me you’d prefer it if I had just left you? I mean, I couldn’t have been more obvious if I tried.” He waved at his clothing, his favourite tan frock-coat with the lovely seed pearl beading. “Mind you, I would have preferred it if they had let me finish my crepes. It’s damned hard to find any at the mo–”  
恶魔哼了一声。“我找了你三次该死的逮捕，你告诉我你宁愿我当初就放过你？我要是再明显点还能怎样？”他挥了挥衣服，那件他最喜欢的棕色长外套，上面镶着漂亮的珍珠。“不过，要是他们让我吃完我的可丽饼再抓我就好了。现在可真难找到好吃的了——”

“Wait, wait, wait!” The angel blinked owlishly at him. “You came here to… find me?”  
“等一下，等一下！” 天使瞪大眼睛看着他。“你来这里是为了……找我？”

Aziraphale looked at him in fond amusement. “Clearly.”  
亚齐拉费尔亲切地笑着看着他。“显然。”

“I thought– isn’t this– didn’t you do all this?”  
“我以为——这不是——你不是做了这一切吗？”

“Me?” Aziraphale puffed up in indignation. “The most I did was spread about the ‘let them eat cake’ nonsense. Apparently, my lot think I’ve been quite influential in the whole thing because of it.” He shuddered in distaste. “You know I don’t like such messy business. Never have.”  
“我？”亚齐拉费尔愤怒地鼓起了肚子。“我所做的最多就是散播‘让他们吃蛋糕’的胡言乱语。显然，我的同类认为我因此在整个事件中起到了相当大的影响。”他厌恶地颤抖着。“你知道我不喜欢这种混乱的事务。从来都不喜欢。”

“Oh.” The angel’s lips twitched into a small smile. “Well. Good.” He was quiet for a moment, then very tentatively asked, “Really? You came to find me?”  
“哦。” 天使的嘴角微微上扬，露出一丝微笑。“嗯。好。” 他静静地沉默了一会儿，然后非常小心地问道：“真的吗？你是来找我的？”

It sounded, Aziraphale thought darkly, as if all those who ought to have cared about the angel had been very neglectful of their duties. “Of course, my dear. Who am I going to tempt into dinner if you don’t have a head?”  
阿齐拉费尔心中暗暗想道，听起来似乎所有应该关心这位天使的人都非常忽视了自己的职责。“当然，亲爱的。如果你没有头，我要引诱谁来共进晚餐呢？”

Crowley ducked his head, looking even more flustered than usual. How absolutely delicious. “Oh. I– you don’t have to.”  
克劳利低下头，看起来比平常更慌乱。太美味了。"哦，我...你不必这样。"

Aziraphale snorted, turning over his hands and examining his chains. “Obviously.” A snap of his fingers and they collapsed around his buckled shoes. He stepped out of the tangle. “And,” he said with a smile, “since I know about your delicate sensibilities about accepting demonic miracles…”  
亚齐拉费尔嗤笑一声，翻转双手，检查着自己的锁链。“显而易见。”他用手指一弹，锁链便松散地落在他的扣鞋周围。他走出了这一团混乱。“而且，”他微笑着说道，“既然我知道你对接受恶魔奇迹有些敏感……”

He tossed the ring of keys, stolen from dear Pierre’s belt, grinning as the angel caught them.  
他抛掷着从亲爱的皮埃尔腰带上偷来的钥匙圈，咧嘴一笑，天使接住了它们。

Crowley hastily stepped back, unlocking his shackles and then the cell door, emerging as Aziraphale strolled out of his own cage. Aziraphale looked him up and down, tutting in concern. The poor fellow looked like he had been through the wringer, his respectable grey frockcoat torn in places and his shirt ripped and stained.  
克劳利匆忙后退，解开他的镣铐，然后打开牢门，就在此时，阿齐拉费尔从自己的牢笼里走了出来。阿齐拉费尔审视着他，担忧地嘟囔了一声。这可怜的家伙看起来像是经历了一场磨难，他体面的灰色长外套在某些地方被撕破，衬衫也被撕裂和弄脏了。

Crowley rubbed gingerly at his wrists. “I–” His brow furrowed. “Hm.”  
克劳利小心地揉了揉手腕。“我——”他皱起了眉头。“嗯。”

Aziraphale leaned closer, lifting a hand to gently rub away the furrow between the angel’s brows. “Enough of that, my dear,” he chastised. “Spit it out. You know I won’t make a fuss.”  
亚齐拉费尔靠近一些，抬起手轻轻地揉去天使眉间的皱纹。“够了，亲爱的，”他责备道。“说出来吧。你知道我不会大惊小怪。”

The angel fidgeted. “I was just wondering if an angel could _hypothetically_ thank a demon for the rescue or if the hypothetical demon would get in trouble. I mean, technically, rescuing an angel wouldn’t look good.”  
天使有些不安地动了动。“我只是在想，天使是否可以假设地感谢恶魔的救援，或者假设的恶魔会因此陷入麻烦。我的意思是，从技术上讲，救援一个天使看起来并不好。”

Aziraphale blinked at him. Honestly, the sweet thing had so much more concern for Aziraphale’s well-being than he really ought to. “Probably best not,” he agreed. “Although I suspect your hypothetical demon would tell you to shut up and stop being so sentimental.”  
亚齐拉费尔眨了眨眼睛。老实说，这个可爱的家伙对亚齐拉费尔的安危关心得太多了，实际上他不应该这样。"最好还是不要说了，"他同意道。"虽然我猜你假设中的恶魔会告诉你闭嘴，别那么多愁善感。"

Crowley’s expression brightened. “That’s what I thought.” He looked at the keys in his hands. “Is there somewhere I can put these?”  
克劳利的表情变得明亮起来。“我就是这么想的。”他看着手中的钥匙。“有地方可以放这些钥匙吗？”

Aziraphale groaned. “Don’t tell me you want him to find them?”  
亚齐拉费尔叹了口气。“别告诉我你想让他找到它们？”

The angel gave him a look. “After all I’ve seen here? I was thinking the bottom of the Seine.”  
天使瞥了他一眼。“在这里见过这么多事情后？我本来以为是塞纳河的底部。”

Christ, he could be such a delightfully ruthless little piece of fluff, couldn’t he?  
天啊，他真是个令人愉快又无情的小家伙，不是吗？

“I know the perfect spot, my dear,” Aziraphale said, “and there’s a lovely little place nearby that does the most divine crepes.”  
“亲爱的，我知道一个完美的地方，”阿齐拉费尔说，“附近还有一家可爱的小店，他们做的薄饼简直是天堂般美味。”

“Crepes?” “薄煎饼？”

“Mm.” Aziraphale leaned closer to him, widening his eyes and trying for his best cherubic expression. “Go on. Say you will. After all, I did just…” He mouthed the word ‘rescue’. “You.” He gave his lashes a careful bat and made sure to jut his lower lip out _just_ enough.  
“嗯。”亚齐拉费尔靠近他，眼睛睁大，试图展现出最可爱的表情。“继续说吧。说你会的。毕竟，我刚刚……”他嘴里嘟囔着“救”这个词。“你。”他小心地眨了眨睫毛，确保下嘴唇微微突出。

“Fine!” Crowley kept a straight face for all of three seconds. “Fine. You win. Crepes it is.” He held up a finger. “One thing, though…” He nodded at Aziraphale’s lovely coat. “Are you trying for a fourth arrest?”  
“好吧！”克劳利板着脸，坚持了整整三秒。“好吧，你赢了。就吃薄煎饼吧。”他举起一根手指。“不过，有一件事……”他朝阿齐拉费尔优美的外套点了点头。“你是在试图被逮捕第四次吗？”

Aziraphale groaned. “They may be doing evil, but at least _I_ have some standards,” he grumbled, flicking his hand upwards and replacing his beloved clothing with a shabbier ensemble and jabot and a tricolour sash for good measure. A snap of his fingers mended Crowley’s ripped coat too. After all, he could hardly be seen swanning about in rags, even if half the revolutionaries were. “Satisfied?”  
亚齐拉费尔叹了口气。“他们可能在做恶事，但至少我还有些准则，”他抱怨道，抬手一挥，将他心爱的衣物换成了一套更破旧的服装，再加上一条领结和一条三色腰带以增加些许效果。他随手一点，还修补了克劳利破烂的外套。毕竟，即使有一半的革命者都穿着破烂，他也不能穿着破布四处晃荡。“满意了吗？”

The angel looked down at his coat, fingering the repaired fabric, then smiled at him, ember-eyes bright with happiness. “Perfectly.”  
天使低头看着他的外套，摩挲着修补过的织物，然后微笑着望着他，眼中闪烁着幸福的光芒。“完美。”

### Chapter Text 章节正文

The ducks were circling when the demon finally arrived.  
恶魔终于到达时，鸭子们正在盘旋。

Crowley had already used up most of his feed, though he always kept a small paper bag for the demon in his pocket. Aziraphale kept forgetting to bring his lately and Crowley didn’t like to remind him, when he seemed to be in a perpetual bad mood. It had been getting worse steadily since the turn of the century, but he had no idea why.  
克劳利已经用掉了他大部分的食物，尽管他总是在口袋里放着一个小纸袋给那个恶魔。阿齐拉费尔最近总是忘记带自己的，而克劳利不喜欢提醒他，因为他似乎一直心情不好。自世纪之交以来，他的情绪一直在逐渐恶化，但他不知道原因。

“I was beginning to think you weren’t coming,” he said, taking out the bag and offering it to Aziraphale.  
“我开始觉得你不会来了。”他说着，拿出袋子递给了阿兹拉菲尔。

The demon took it, glancing around. “You know how it is,” he said a little too quickly. He tossed a handful of seeds at the ducks. “One temptation, then another.”  
恶魔拿着它，四处扫视着。“你知道怎么回事，”他有点急促地说道。他向鸭子们扔了一把种子。“一个诱惑，接着又是另一个。”

Crowley shot a sidelong look at him. From the creases down the side of his face, Aziraphale had barely been out of bed for half an hour. The demon certainly enjoy indulging in sleep, even though he didn’t have to. Still, you wouldn’t have guessed it from his clothes, which looked freshly-pressed and he had yet another elegant, ruffled tie.  
克劳利斜眼看了他一眼。从阿齐拉费尔脸颊两侧的皱纹来看，他刚刚起床还不到半小时。这个恶魔确实喜欢沉溺于睡眠，尽管他并不需要。不过，从他的衣着来看，你绝对猜不出来，它们看起来熨得很整齐，他还系着一条优雅而蓬松的领带。

“Mm,” he said noncommittally.  
“嗯。”他不置可否地说道。

Another handful of seed hit one of the ducks with enough force to make it quack in alarm and frantically paddle away.  
又一把种子狠狠地击中了其中一只鸭子，足够让它惊叫并拼命划水逃离。

That, Crowley thought worriedly, was even more unusual than the tardiness and the bad moods. Aziraphale _hated_ causing physical harm to anyone. Messy business, as he called it. He preferred to let humans do the actual work.  
克劳利心里忧虑地想，这比迟到和情绪不好更加不寻常。阿齐拉费尔讨厌对任何人造成身体伤害。他称之为麻烦事。他更喜欢让人类来做实际的工作。

“Are you all right?” Crowley asked.  
“你还好吗？”克劳利问道。

Aziraphale nodded, reaching up to push back his cream-and-brown patterned top hat and rub at curls of pale hair that were clinging to his forehead. He looked almost feverish. “Of course, my dear. Of course.” His tongue darted out along his lips, then he hastily added, “I need a favour.”  
亚齐拉费尔点了点头，伸手推开他那顶奶油色和棕色图案的高顶帽，揉了揉贴在额头上的一缕淡色卷发。他看起来几乎发烧了。“当然，亲爱的。当然。”他的舌头舔了舔嘴唇，然后匆忙地补充道：“我需要个帮忙。”

Crowley’s frown deepened. “We have the arrangement–” he began.  
克劳利的皱眉加深了。“我们有安排——”他开始说道。

“This is something else,” Aziraphale interrupted shortly. “A precaution, you understand. In case…” His face twisted into some unreadable expression. “Well, in case things don’t go as planned.” He glanced around again, as if afraid he was being followed. “Here.” He offered a folded piece of paper. “Best not said out loud.”  
“这是另外一回事，”阿齐拉费尔短暂地打断道。“这是个预防措施，你懂的。以防万一……”他的脸上扭曲出一种难以捉摸的表情。“嗯，以防计划不如预期。”他再次环顾四周，仿佛害怕有人跟踪。“给你。”他递出一张折叠的纸。“最好不要大声说出来。”

Crowley took the small sheet. Two words were written in Aziraphale’s perfect copperplate hand. _Holy water_.  
克劳利接过那张小纸片。阿齐拉费尔完美的铜版手写着两个字。圣水。

The world seemed to narrow down to that piece of paper, everything else quiet and blank around it. Holy water. The one thing that could kill any and every demon on contact. It was a liquid hand grenade in any angel’s arsenal. Just take off the lid and throw and death and carnage ensued.  
世界似乎只剩下那张纸，周围一片寂静和空白。圣水，唯一能够与任何恶魔接触即刻致命的东西。对于任何天使来说，它就像是一颗液体手榴弹，只需打开盖子，投掷出去，死亡和屠杀就会随之而来。

And Aziraphale wanted it.  
而阿齐拉费尔也想要它。

Crowley felt sick. 克劳利感到恶心。

Yes, Aziraphale had been more bad-tempered lately, snappish and guarded and out of sorts, but surely things weren’t bad enough that he wanted to… that he thought he had no choice but…  
是的，最近阿齐拉费尔变得更加脾气暴躁、警惕和心情不好，但是肯定不至于糟糕到他想要...他认为自己别无选择..

The paper was shaking in his hand. “No.” He shoved it back at the demon. “Don’t be so… so damned stupid! I’m _not_ giving you _that_!”  
纸在他手中颤抖着。“不。”他将它狠狠地推回给恶魔。“别这么……这么该死的愚蠢！我不会给你那个！”

Aziraphale’s face crumpled and for the first time, Crowley realised how upset the demon was. “Why not?”  
亚齐拉费尔的脸皱了起来，克劳利第一次意识到恶魔有多么难过。“为什么不呢？”

Why not? Looking that worried and being so out of sorts for months and years on end and he asked why not?  
为什么不呢？看起来那么担心，心情糟糕了几个月甚至几年，他问为什么不呢？

“You know what it’ll do to you!” he said, his voice shaking as much as his hands. “I’m not giving you a suicide pill!”  
“你知道它会对你造成什么影响！”他说道，声音和双手都颤抖着。“我可不会给你一颗自杀药！”

The demon flinched. “That’s _not_ what I want it for!” I just–” He pressed a plump fist to his mouth, then exhaled. He almost sounded calm when he said, “It’s a precaution.” He held out the piece of paper again. “Nothing more than that.”  
恶魔畏缩了一下。“那不是我想要的！”他只是——”他用胖胖的拳头捂住嘴，然后呼出一口气。当他说：“这只是个预防措施。”时，他几乎听起来很平静。他再次递出那张纸。“仅此而已。”

A precaution. For if things went wrong. From a demon who would rather avoid any messy business if he could avoid. Apparently by whatever means necessary.  
一项预防措施。以防万一出了问题。来自一个宁愿避免任何麻烦事的恶魔。显然，不惜一切手段。

“Don’t,” Crowley said hoarsely. “Please don’t ask me to be a part of it.”  
“别，”克劳利沙哑地说道。“请不要让我参与其中。”

“You _are_ part of it,” the demon retorted. “Like it or not.”  
“你是其中一部分，”恶魔反驳道。“不管你喜不喜欢。”

He shook his head, clenching his hands by his sides. “This… it’s too far, Aziraphale. You know how much trouble we could be in if they find out we’ve been… been…” He trailed off, his tongue like a rock.  
他摇了摇头，双手紧握在身旁。“这...太过分了，阿齐拉费尔。你知道如果他们发现我们一直在...在...”他停顿了下来，舌头像块石头一样。

“Been?” There was a frostiness in the demon’s voice. “Been what _precisely_?”  
“去过？”恶魔的声音中带着一丝冷冽。“去过什么？”

Crowley waved helplessly between them.  “This. Whatever… this is.”  
克劳利无助地在他们之间挥手。“这个。无论是什么……这个。”

“Whatever,” Aziraphale echoed. “Oh. I see.” He smiled, but for once, it didn’t reach his blue eyes, which were cold and hard. “Oh, don’t worry, my dear, you needn’t worry about that. I can do whatever I want, whenever I want, with whomever I choose.”  
“随便你。”亚齐拉费尔回应道。“哦，我明白了。”他微笑了一下，但这次笑容没有传达到他冷漠而坚定的蓝眼睛中。“哦，亲爱的，别担心，你不必为此担心。我可以随心所欲地做任何事情，无论何时何地，与任何人。”

Crowley reared back, stung. “Of course you can,” he snapped back angrily. “You always have.”  
克劳利退后一步，感到受伤。他愤怒地回答道：“当然你可以。”“你一直都可以。”

The demon’s eyes flashed, his lips curling back from unnaturally-pointed teeth. “I don’t need you, _angel_.”  
恶魔的眼睛闪烁着，他的嘴唇露出了不自然尖锐的牙齿。“我不需要你，天使。”

Crowley stared at him. “Fine!” He swung around, storming up the path, fighting every instinct that told him to turn around, go back and apologise. “Fine,” he whispered under his breath and tried to blink the haze from his eyes.  
克劳利盯着他看。“好吧！”他转身，愤怒地沿着小径走去，抵抗着每一个告诉他要回头、回去道歉的本能。“好吧，”他低声喃喃，试图眨眨眼睛中的迷雾。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Distant sirens were wailing as Crowley hurried up the path towards the church. The searchlights were stabbing up at the heavy clouds and he could smell the rain in the air. He hugged the book more tightly to his chest, praying that everything would go to plan.  
当克劳利匆匆走向教堂的小径时，远处的警笛声响起。探照灯刺向厚重的云层，他能闻到空气中的雨水味道。他紧紧地抱着书，祈祷一切都能按计划进行。

Why they would choose this place of all places for a meeting point seemed a bit on the nose. He knew who they were. They knew he knew. No one, they had laughed, would look for Nazis in a Church.  
为什么他们会选择这个地方作为会面点，似乎有点太明显了。他知道他们是谁。他们知道他知道。他们笑着说，没有人会在教堂里寻找纳粹分子。

Crowley had smiled and laughed with them, but he had been to Germany only a few weeks ago and plenty of Nazis could be found in churches. Many of them liked to use it as an excuse and even though Aziraphale hadn’t asked – hadn’t even spoken to him since that stupid, awful day in St. James’s Park – he put a little temptation as well as a miracle of courage into a few minds to ensure there were a few less Nazis to take Her name in vain.  
克劳利曾经与他们一起微笑和大笑，但他几周前才去过德国，教堂里有很多纳粹分子。其中许多人喜欢以此为借口，尽管阿齐拉费尔从未询问过，甚至自从那个愚蠢可怕的圣詹姆斯公园的那一天以来，他也从未与他说过话，但他在几个人的心中植入了一点诱惑和勇气的奇迹，以确保有更少的纳粹分子敢妄称她的名字。

He paused at the door, taking a deep breath, then stepped into the building.  
他在门口停顿了一下，深吸了一口气，然后走进了建筑物。

The place was alight with candles, warm and glowing and welcoming. It should have felt safe and sacred, but the presence of the two men – at the altar, for Heaven’s sake! – made him tighten his hands around the book he was carrying.  
这个地方点满了蜡烛，温暖、明亮、热情。本应该感觉安全和神圣，但是两个男人的存在——在祭坛上，天哪！——让他紧紧地握紧了手中的书。

“Mr. Crowley.” Glozier said, smiling. “We were beginning to wonder if you would come.”  
“克劳利先生。”格洛泽微笑着说道，“我们开始担心您是否会来。”

Crowley forced a smile onto his face and walked briskly down the aisle. “Well, I would hate to disappoint you now,” he said, his cheeks hurting with the effort.  
克劳利勉强笑了笑，迅速地走过过道。“嗯，现在我可不想让你失望，”他说着，脸颊因为努力而感到疼痛。

Mr. Harmony rose, a hungry look in his eyes. “You have the book?”  
和谐先生站了起来，眼中闪烁着饥饿的目光。“你有那本书吗？”

Lord, Crowley wished he’d never agreed to it. He could have found a false copy. He could have lied. He could have done anything but stretch out his hands, holding out the tome to the man. “As requested, the _Sefer Raziel HaMalakh_.”  
克劳利心里暗自后悔答应了这件事。他本可以找到一本假冒的副本。他本可以撒谎。他本可以做任何事情，只是不伸出双手，将那本书递给那个人。“按照要求，这是《塞弗·拉齐尔·哈玛拉赫》。”

Harmony’s eyes gleamed greedily as he snatched the book from Crowley’s hands. He didn’t even flinch, but then, maybe he wasn’t a human who was meant to feel the power bound up in the tome. It was Her will, of course.  
当哈蒙尼贪婪地从克劳利手中夺过那本书时，他的眼睛闪烁着贪婪的光芒。他甚至没有一丝动摇，也许他并不是一个能够感受到那本书所蕴含的力量的人类。当然，这是她的意愿。

Harmony opened the gnarled and ancient covers, leafing through pages that had been copied and recopied more times than Crowley could recall. Behind his glasses, his eyes widened and he looked over at Glozier. “It’s the real thing.”  
和谐打开了扭曲而古老的封面，翻阅着被复制和再复制过无数次的页码，克劳利难以回忆起具体次数。透过眼镜，他的眼睛睁大了，转向格洛泽。"这是真的。"

Glozier moved closer, bending to peer down at the book. “You’re certain?” Harmony muttered something in German, which made his partner grin delightedly. “Marvellous. You have done very well, Mr. Crowley.”  
Glozier靠近一些，弯下腰来看着那本书。“你确定吗？”Harmony用德语嘟囔了一句，让他的伙伴开心地笑了起来。“太棒了。你做得非常好，Crowley先生。”

Crowley sighed inwardly when he heard the click of the gun being cocked. Just once, he thought sadly, it would have been nice to be wrong about people. But then, they were Nazis and there wasn’t really much more you could expect from them.  
当克劳利听到枪扳机的咔嗒声时，他内心不禁叹了口气。他心里黯然地想，要是能对人们的判断错一次就好了。但是，他们是纳粹，对他们来说，实在没有什么更多的期望了。

“Don’t,” he said wearily.  
“别这样。”他疲倦地说道。

“Don’t?” Glozier said, amusement all over his face. “You think this is how it works, Mr. Crowley?”  
“不要？”格洛泽说道，脸上洋溢着一丝娱乐之情。“你以为这就是事情的运作方式，克劳利先生？”

The angel pinched the bridge of his nose, one hand on his hip. “Rose?”  
天使捏了捏鼻梁，一手顶在腰间。“Rose？”

A second gun cocked, this one behind him.  
一把第二把枪被扳动，这把枪在他身后。

“Who–?” “谁——？”

Crowley lowered his hand, giving them a tired smile. “Spy, Nazis,” he introduced. “Nazis, spy.” He jerked his thumb towards the back of the church. “Now, if you don’t mind, she’s going to arrest you and I’m going to go and get a drink.”  
克劳利放下手，给他们一个疲惫的微笑。“间谍，纳粹，”他介绍道。“纳粹，间谍。”他用拇指指向教堂后面。“现在，如果你们不介意的话，她会逮捕你们，而我要去喝一杯。”

He turned around to face Captain Montgomery, only to find her gun pointed at him and not at the two men at the altar. She gave him a crooked smile and shrugged, as if she hadn’t played him like a fiddle and walked him right into his own discorporation.  
他转过身面对蒙哥马利船长，却发现她的枪指着他，而不是指向祭坛上的两个男人。她给了他一个歪歪斜斜的微笑，耸了耸肩，仿佛她没有像玩弄小提琴一样耍弄他，把他引向自己的消亡。

“Oh, for God’s sake!” he exclaimed, spinning around to face them. “She’s with you?”  
"哦，天哪！"他转过身来面对他们说道。"她跟着你们？"

Well, he thought bitterly as they grinned at him, you wanted to be wrong about someone didn’t you, you _idiot_.  
他心中苦涩地想着，当他们冲着他咧嘴笑时，你真希望自己对某人的看法错了，真是个白痴。

“And sadly, she will also be killing you.”  
“可悲的是，她也将杀死你。”

“Right.” Crowley looked at the floor, blowing out a sigh. “Right. Of course. Why not? Killed by Nazis in a Church on a Sunday. Perfect. Just fantastic.” He threw his head back and stared up at the ceiling. “Bet you’re having a great laugh up there, aren’t you? Ooooh, he took the book to give to the humans again! Bet he won’t see this coming!” He threw his arms wide. “Come on! Give me a break!” His voice faltered and he dropped his arms. “Please?”  
"对。" 克劳利低头看着地板，叹了口气。"对。当然。为什么不呢？在一个星期天被纳粹杀在教堂里。太完美了。太棒了。" 他仰头望着天花板。"我打赌你在上面乐翻了吧？哦，他又把书拿给人类了！我打赌他没料到这一招！" 他伸开双臂。"拜托！给我个机会吧！" 他的声音渐渐颤抖，双臂垂下。"求求你了？"

“Prayer won’t help you now, Mr. Crowley,” Glozier said, “but we do appreciate all you have done, so we will make it a quick–”  
“祈祷现在对你没有帮助，克劳利先生，”格洛泽说，“但我们非常感谢你所做的一切，所以我们会尽快解决——”

The door of the church crashing inwards interrupted him, followed by an “Oh, holy _fuck_! Ow!”  
教堂的门向内砰地一声打开，打断了他的话，接着传来一声“哦，圣妈！哎呀！”

Crowley whipped around, startled. He knew that voice. He would recognise that voice anywhere, and there he was. Aziraphale, bouncing down the aisle like a badly-buoyed balloon, bobbing from toe to toe. “Aziraphale?”  
克劳利吓了一跳，他认出了那个声音。他无论在哪里都能辨认出那个声音，而他就在那里。阿齐拉费尔像一个被糟糕地充气的气球一样，在过道上蹦蹦跳跳，从脚尖到脚尖。"阿齐拉费尔？"

The demon waved vaguely, every step accompanied with a fresh profanity. “Jesus, Mary, Joseph, fucking Nora, bloody buggering bastarding ow!”  
恶魔随意挥舞着手，每一步都伴随着新的咒骂声。“天啊，圣母玛利亚，约瑟夫，该死的诺拉，该死的混蛋，该死的混账家伙，哎呀！”

God, it was good to see him, but not _here_. Not in a church. Not when they had guns trained on them and everything had been left so horribly wrong.  
天啊，见到他真好，但不应该在这里。不应该在教堂里。不应该在他们被枪指着的时候，一切都变得如此糟糕。

“What the hell are you doing here?” he demanded.  
“你他妈在这里干什么？”他要求道。

Aziraphale flashed a pained grin at him. “Messing with your business arrangement!” He held up a bundle of books tied together with string. “Let this one go and I’ll give you some tasty prophecies for you to take back to your Fuhrer. Binns, Shipton, Nixon. First editions too.”  
亚齐拉费尔苦笑着对他说道：“捣乱你的生意安排！”他举起一捆用绳子捆绑在一起的书。“放过这本，我会给你一些美味的预言，你可以带回给你的元首。宾斯、希普顿、尼克松。还是第一版的。”

Books. Aziraphale’s books. He never let anyone near them. He rarely even let Crowley look at them, unless he wore his white gloves and promised not to break any spines. And after the years they hadn’t spoken to one another, he’d still brought them here to trade for…  
书。阿齐拉费尔的书。他从不让任何人接近它们。他甚至很少让克劳利看一眼，除非他戴上白手套并承诺不弄坏任何书脊。即使在多年没有彼此交谈之后，他仍然把它们带到这里交换……

Crowley’s legs trembled under him, his hand leaping to his mouth.  
克劳利的双腿颤抖着，他的手猛地捂住了嘴巴。

“Prophecies?” “预言？”

The angel was close enough to feel the prickle of covetousness from Harmony, pricking away at the soft warmth that was threatening to smother him.  
天使离Harmony足够近，能感受到她贪婪的刺痛，刺痛着那温暖的软弱，威胁着将他淹没。

“Aziraphale, don’t,” he said urgently. “They’re your books. You don’t need to give them away. I’m fine.”  
“亚齐拉费尔，别这样。”他紧急地说道。“那些是你的书。你不需要把它们送走。我没事。”

Aziraphale pointedly looked at the guns as he lightly bounced on the spot. “Fine. I see.” He jerked his head towards the door as Harmony snatched the bundle of books from his hand. “Go on. Bugger off. I’ll tidy up here.”  
亚齐拉费尔注视着那些枪支，轻轻地在原地跳动着。“好吧，我明白了。”他朝门口点了点头，哈莫尼从他手中抢过一捆书。“走吧，滚蛋吧。我会在这里整理好的。”

“I won’t!” Crowley shook his head. “Not this time.”  
“我不会的！”克劳利摇了摇头。“这次不行。”

“I think,” Glozier said, his smile audible, “you misunderstand the situation, Mr. Crowley. Whatever your… ebullient friend’s intentions are, we are the ones who hold the guns. We will take your books too, since you have brought them all this way.”  
“我觉得，”格洛泽说着，他的微笑听得出来，“克劳利先生，你误解了情况。无论你那位热情洋溢的朋友有何意图，我们才是手握枪支的人。既然你已经把书带到这里，我们也会把它们一并拿走。”

Crowley saw the gleam of hellfire in Aziraphale’s eyes. “Oh no.”  
克劳利看到了阿齐拉费尔眼中的地狱之火闪耀。“哦不。”

The demon’s smile split his face. “Oh, don’t worry, my dear,” he said, looking beyond Crowley’s shoulder at the two Nazis. “_I_ won’t do anything to them.” He tilted his head, staring at them, unblinking. The way he was moving lightly from foot to foot made him sway like a snake. “I rather think hubris might.”  
恶魔的笑容扭曲了他的脸。“哦，别担心，亲爱的，”他说着，目光穿过克劳利的肩膀看向那两个纳粹。“我不会对他们做什么。”他歪着头，凝视着他们，目不转睛。他轻盈地踮起脚尖，像蛇一样摇摆。“我倒觉得傲慢可能会。”

“Enough,” Glozier said. “We are done wi–”  
“够了。”格洛泽说道。“我们已经完–”

“Ah,” Aziraphale took slinking steps forward. “Before you get around to it, you should know that in about thirty seconds, a bomb is going to be dropped right on this building. Shoot us, if you like, but you’ll have to be damned quick if you want to get out alive.”  
“啊，”亚齐拉费尔小心翼翼地向前迈出几步。“在你开始行动之前，你应该知道大约三十秒后，一颗炸弹将会直接落在这栋建筑上。如果你愿意，可以射击我们，但如果你想活着离开，你必须非常迅速。”

Glozier snorted. “Very amusing, but we know the bombs will fall on the East end tonight.”  
Glozier哼了一声。“很有趣，但我们知道炸弹今晚会落在东区。”

Aziraphale flashed a serpentine grin, his fangs lengthening. “Even odds?” he said, then snapped his fingers.  
亚齐拉费尔露出一丝蛇一般的笑容，他的尖牙变得更长了。“平分胜负？”他说着，然后咔嗒一声响指。

Above them, something was screaming down from above.  
在他们上方，有东西从上面尖叫着降落下来。

Crowley stared at him. “Oh no, no, no, no! Aziraphale! You didn’t!”  
克劳利盯着他。“哦不，不，不，不！亚齐拉费尔！你没这么做吧！”

Behind him, the Nazis swore, scrambling up and scrabbling for the books.  
在他身后，纳粹们咒骂着，争先恐后地抓取那些书籍。

Aziraphale’s expression softened as he smiled at him. “Only a little one,” he said. “Although we may need a real miracle to get out of this alive, dear boy.”  
亚齐拉费尔的表情柔和了下来，他微笑着看着他说道：“只是小事一桩。”他说，“尽管我们可能需要一个真正的奇迹才能活着离开这里，亲爱的孩子。”

“A real…” Crowley’s breath hitched and he closed his eyes, calling on every bit of his power as the bomb struck.  
“真实的……” 克劳利喘息着闭上了眼睛，调动着自己所有的力量，当炸弹爆炸时。

Sirens were wailing again, louder and closer. Somewhere nearby, a panicked child was screaming in terror, and as the dust settled, Crowley uncurled his fingers. His palms were sticky where his nails had dug in, but it had been enough and Aziraphale was standing there, face turned up to the moonlight, sighing with relief.  
警笛再次响起，声音更大、更近。附近某处，一个惊慌失措的孩子正在恐惧中尖叫，当尘埃落定时，克劳利松开了手指。他的手掌因为指甲的刺入而黏腻，但这已经足够了，阿齐拉费尔站在那里，脸庞仰望着月光，松了一口气。

“Oh, that’s _much_ better.”  
哦，这好多了。

Crowley shifted from one foot to the other, rubble rippling under his feet. “You didn’t– I–” His throat felt too tight and he wanted to believe it was the dust making his eyes sting. “You’re being kind to me again.”  
克劳利在碎石上踱来踱去，一只脚换到另一只脚上。“你没——我——”他觉得喉咙像被勒住了，想要相信是灰尘让他眼睛发痛。“你又对我好了。”

The demon looked over at him with a small, quiet smile. “Obviously.” He dusted flecks of ash from his sleeves, then looked around forlornly. “I probably shouldn’t have brought the original books, should I?”  
恶魔微微一笑，看着他说：“显然。”他从袖子上拂去一些灰烬，然后遗憾地四处张望着。“我可能不应该带原版书来，对吧？”

Crowly stared at him. “Oh! Oh, wait!” He turned on the spot, searching around in the rubble, scrambling across it gracelessly. “Ah!” He sprang up victorious, a bundle of perfectly-tied books in one hand, his own book in the other, and beamed at the demon. “The least I could do, since you came all this way for me.”  
Crowly盯着他看。“哦！哦，等等！”他原地转身，在废墟中四处搜寻，笨拙地爬过去。“啊！”他得意地跳了起来，一手拿着一捆完美绑好的书，另一手拿着自己的书，对恶魔笑容满面。“既然你为了我走了这么远，这是我能做的最少的事情。”

Aziraphale stared at him, looking more dazed than Crowley had ever seen him before.  
亚齐拉费尔盯着他看，看起来比克劳利以往见过的任何时候都更迷茫。

Crowley hopped back over the rubble and held out the bundle, then looked down at the book in his other arm. Well, of all the people who would appreciate and take care of the book as it deserved, he could think of no one better. “Would you like this one as well?”  
克劳利跳过瓦砾，伸出捆绑物，然后低头看着他另一只手臂上的书。嗯，对于能够真正欣赏并妥善保管这本书的人，他想不出有比你更合适的人选了。“你也想要这本吗？”

“This one?” Aziraphale echoed, looking down.  
“这个？”亚齐拉费尔回应道，低头看着。

Crowley held out the other book to him.  
克劳利把另一本书递给了他。

The demon’s eyes widened in shock. “That’s…”  
恶魔的眼睛惊讶地睁大了。“那是……”

Crowley nodded. “I think you’re the best person to look after it.” He held it out. “I can’t say thank you, but…” He shrugged with a tentative smile. “Please?”  
克劳利点了点头。“我觉得你是最适合照顾它的人。”他伸出手。“我无法说谢谢，但是……”他带着一个试探性的微笑耸了耸肩。“拜托了？”

A dazzling beautiful smile lit the demon’s face and he nodded, taking both bundle and book with such reverence that Crowley knew at once he had been forgiven for the mess in the park and that he had made the right choice.  
一个耀眼美丽的微笑点亮了恶魔的脸庞，他点了点头，怀着敬畏之心接过了捆绑物和书籍，克劳利立刻知道自己已经被原谅了公园的混乱，并且他做出了正确的选择。

“Do…” He hesitated, then adjusted his hat. “I’ve got a car now. Would you like a lift home?”  
“嗯……”他犹豫了一下，然后调整了一下帽子。“我现在有车了。你要搭车回家吗？”

“My dear,” Aziraphale said, his voice soft and wondering, “I would be delighted.”  
“亲爱的，”阿齐拉费尔轻声而惊叹地说道，“我会非常高兴。”

### Chapter Text 章节正文

It was, perhaps, foolish to continue with his plan, but Aziraphale knew he had no choice.  
或许继续他的计划有些愚蠢，但阿齐拉费尔知道他别无选择。

Unlike many angels, Hell never forgot a deadline. In fact, they took great pleasure in breathing down your neck to remind you of it. They especially didn’t forget a deadline that would give them chance to – as Beelzebub eloquently declared – put the boot in to their Heavenly counterparts.  
与许多天使不同，地狱从不会忘记截止日期。事实上，他们非常乐意在你耳边催促你，以提醒你。他们尤其不会忘记那些能让他们有机会对天堂同行进行“踢一脚”的截止日期。

The trouble was – and always had been – that Aziraphale didn’t particularly give a damn about Heaven. Or Hell for that matter. They were like two dogs fighting over a bone that held absolutely no interest to anyone who had experienced life beyond “the war”.  
问题是，而且一直都是，亚齐拉费尔并不特别在乎天堂。或者地狱也一样。它们就像两只狗为了一根对任何经历过“战争”之外的生活毫无兴趣的骨头而争斗。

And oh, he had experienced it in full and had no intention of seeing it burned down around him all over again. If that meant taking up arms, then so be it.  
哦，他已经充分经历过这一切，绝不打算再次看到它被毁灭。如果这意味着拿起武器，那就这样吧。

He settled back in his chair, crossing one leg over the other, and folding his hands over his middle.  
他舒服地坐回椅子上，一条腿交叉在另一条腿上，双手折叠在腹部。

“You understand, of course, that this job will require the utmost discretion.” The two rogue humans he had chosen exchanged puzzled glances and he forced himself to keep smiling quietly. “Your silence, my dears. No one can know of this particular… theft.”  
“你当然明白，这份工作需要极高的谨慎。”他选择的那两个不守规矩的人相互看了看，他强迫自己保持微笑。“保持沉默，亲爱的。不能让任何人知道这次特别的……盗窃。”

“Yeah,” Spike said, nodding. “Shouldn’t be a–”  
“是的，” Spike 点头说道。“不应该是一-”

Like the human, Aziraphale glanced towards the front of the book shop. The door had been securely locked only moments ago, which meant the door should not have swung open. Neither should booted feet have marched in across the polished stone of the floor.  
就像人类一样，阿齐拉费尔朝书店的前方瞥了一眼。门刚刚被牢牢地锁上，所以门不应该自动打开。也不应该有穿着靴子的脚步在抛光的石地板上行进。

A young man appeared in the doorway. Tall, sharp-eyed, rough about the edges, with enough of a flavour of corruption about him that said he was far from an innocent little passer-by. “Heard you were looking for a lockman,” he said.  
一个年轻人出现在门口。高个子，眼神锐利，外表有些粗糙，带着一种腐败的气息，说明他绝不是一个无辜的过路人。“听说你在找一个锁匠，”他说道。

Aziraphale unfolded his hands, propping an elbow on the arm of the chair. He ran two fingertips over his lips and chin, keeping his eyes on the intruder. “You are a good deal… younger than Mr. Narker, my dear,” he murmured. “I’m sure I would remember your face, had I seen it before.”  
亚齐拉费尔展开双手，用手肘撑在椅子扶手上。他用两根指尖轻抚着嘴唇和下巴，目光始终盯着闯入者。“亲爱的，你比纳克先生年轻得多呢。”他低声说道。“如果我之前见过你，我肯定会记得你的脸。”

The human’s bluster faltered just enough, which made Aziraphale’s lips twitch. Ahhh. One of _those_ kind of young men. They were always such fun to play with.  
人类的威风稍稍动摇了一下，这让阿齐拉费尔的嘴角不禁抽动了一下。啊，这种年轻人真是有趣。和他们玩耍总是那么有趣。

“Mr. Narker,” the man said, his whole body suddenly far tenser than it had been, “has passed onto his reward.” He hesitated and Aziraphale could guess why and had to rein in the urge to raise his eyebrows and bat his lashes.  
“纳克先生，”那个男人说道，他的整个身体突然变得比之前更加紧张，“已经离世了。”他犹豫了一下，阿齐拉费尔能够猜到原因，不得不克制住抬起眉毛和眨眼的冲动。

“And you have come to bring me the sad tidings, have you?” He inclined his head. “If that’s all you’re here for, then best be on your way.”  
"你是来给我带来悲伤的消息的，是吗？" 他微微点头。"如果你只是为了这个而来，那最好赶紧离开吧。"

The young man’s eyes rolled back towards the door, as if he had regretted his decision to even broach their company. “I– I took over the business. He and I shared a cell,” he finally said. “He taught me everything he knew.”  
年轻人的眼睛朝着门口翻了回去，仿佛他后悔自己决定接近他们公司一样。“我...我接管了生意。他和我共处一牢，”他最终说道。“他教会了我他所知道的一切。”

And he had already proved that well enough by slipping the demonic lock on the door of the shop.  
他已经通过解开店门上的邪恶锁证明得足够好了。

“Ah.” Aziraphale smiled. “I see. Very well, Mr…?”  
“啊。”亚齐拉费尔微笑着说道。“我明白了。好的，先生……？”

“Shadwell,” the man replied. “Lance Corporal Shadwell.”  
“沙德威尔，”那个男人回答道。“沙德威尔下士。”

It took all of Aziraphale’s considerable will not to laugh at the pride in the boy’s face. “Take a seat, Lance Corporal Shadwell.”  
阿齐拉费尔竭尽全力忍住不笑，看着男孩脸上的骄傲表情说道：“请坐，上士沙德韦尔。”

The rest of the gathering went as planned, give or take a few tentative interruptions from their newest arrival harping on about witches. A closer glance let Aziraphale see the seed of fanaticism already germinating well. That kind of mind was always rather useful.  
聚会的其余部分按计划进行，除了最新到来的人对女巫的一些犹豫打断。仔细一看，亚齐拉费尔发现狂热主义的种子已经在那里蓬勃发芽。那种思维方式总是相当有用的。

Once all instructions were given, he ushered them to the back door of the shop. There was a narrow alley directly behind it, currently occupied by a couple of ladies and their temporary gentlemen, which opened into another series of labyrinthine passages. No one would ever know the little trio of troublemakers had ever come near his shop or near one another for that matter.  
一旦所有指示都给出了，他就把他们引导到店铺的后门。后门直接对着一条狭窄的小巷，目前正有几位女士和她们的临时绅士在那里，小巷通向一系列迷宫般的通道。没有人会知道这个小小的捣蛋三人组曾经靠近他的店铺，或者彼此靠近过。

Shadwell hesitated after Spike and his lady friend had vanished off into the night. “Mr. Fell. Sir…”  
夜幕降临后，Spike和他的女伴消失在黑暗中，Shadwell犹豫了一下。“费尔先生，先生……”

Aziraphale leaned his upper arm against the doorframe, curling his arm up to lazily finger the wood. “You need some additional instructions, do you, Shadwell?” He saw the boy framing his rank on his lips. “Ah, ah, ah, Shadwell. Don’t imagine you can give orders here. Isn’t that what they teach you, my dear?” He swayed closer, smiling. “_Respect_ your commanding officer?”  
亚齐拉费尔将上臂靠在门框上，懒散地弯曲手臂，轻轻地抚摸着木头。“沙德威尔，你需要一些额外的指示吗？”他看到男孩嘴唇上浮现出他的军衔。“啊，啊，啊，沙德威尔。别以为你可以在这里下命令。亲爱的，他们不是这样教你的吗？”他靠近一些，微笑着。“尊重你的指挥官？”

Shadwell’s throat worked frantically. Oh, what a dilemma to be faced with. Aziraphale could almost feel the poor creature’s little brain overheating as he processed conflicting reactions. “Aye, m’lord. Sir. It is. Respect, sir.”  
沙德维尔的喉咙疯狂地动了起来。哦，面对这样的两难境地真是太困扰了。阿齐拉费尔几乎能感受到这可怜生物的小脑袋在处理矛盾的反应时过热的情况。“是的，大人。先生。没错，尊敬，先生。”

“Better,” Aziraphale purred. “You were saying?”  
“更好了，”阿齐拉费尔轻声说道。“你刚才说什么来着？”

Shadwell licked at his lips and Aziraphale couldn’t help himself, very blatantly and deliberately watching them. Shadwell flushed a beautiful shade of crimson.  
沙德维尔舔了舔嘴唇，阿齐拉费尔情不自禁地盯着他们看，非常明显和故意。沙德维尔脸色变得美丽的深红色。

“I don’t have all night… Lance Corporal.”  
“我可没整晚的时间……下士。”

Shadwell straightened his back. “Yes, sir! You remember earlier this evening, I asked a rather pointed question about witchcraft?”  
沙德维尔挺直了背。“是的，先生！您还记得今晚早些时候，我问了一个相当尖锐的关于巫术的问题吗？”

Aziraphale arched an eyebrow. “Yes.”  
亚齐拉费尔挑了挑眉毛。“是的。”

The young man leaned closer, then seemed to think the better of it when he got a deliberate waft of Aziraphale’s cologne. “I’m the member of an anonymous organisation. Vast. A secret army that battles the forces of witchery.”  
这个年轻人靠近了一些，但当他闻到亚齐拉费尔身上散发出的香水味时，他似乎又改变了主意。“我是一个匿名组织的成员。庞大的组织。一个与巫术势力作战的秘密军队。”

“And?” Aziraphale prompted, pushing himself off from the door frame, amused when Shadwell took a step back. “Problem, Lance Corporal?”  
“还有什么？”亚齐拉费尔询问道，他从门框上推开自己，当夏德维尔退后一步时感到很有趣。“有问题，下士？”

Shadwell shook his head, stepping forward again. “No, sir! None, sir!” He fumbled with his hands, settling for shoving them into his pockets. “I– it–the Witchfinder Army. Perhaps you’ve heard of it, sir?”  
沙德维尔摇了摇头，再次迈步前进。“不，先生！没有，先生！”他手忙脚乱地摆弄着双手，最后将它们塞进口袋里。“我——它——女巫猎人军团。也许您听说过，先生？”

By Satan, it had been a long while since he’d heard of that particular branch of nutcases. “Oh, I see,” he said, nodding slowly. “It all makes sense now, Lance Corporal.” He reached out and tapped his fingers lightly on Shadwell’s sternum, making him sway back instinctively. “You are the perfect soldier for such a… singular organisation.”  
天哪，他已经很久没有听说过那个特殊的疯子组织了。“哦，我明白了，下士。”他慢慢点头，“现在一切都有道理了。”他伸手轻轻敲了敲沙德维尔的胸骨，让他本能地后退。“你是这样一个…独特组织的完美士兵。”

The pride that bloomed in the man was almost pitiable. “Thank you, sir!” He even risked leaning a little closer. “And if a gentleman such as yourself ever has need of such an organisation, the Witchfinder Army are here for you.”  
这个男人心中的自豪几乎令人怜悯。“谢谢您，先生！”他甚至冒险靠近了一点。“如果像您这样的绅士有需要这样一个组织的话，女巫猎人军团会为您效劳。”

Aziraphale patted his chest. “What a generous offer,” he murmured, giving the human his third-best filthy smile. “I may well take you up on it.”  
亚齐拉费尔轻拍了一下胸口。“多么慷慨的提议啊，”他低声说道，露出了他第三招最好的狡黠笑容。“我很可能会接受你的好意。”

Shadwell’s face flamed crimson again and he hastily stepped back, almost tripping over his own feet before scrambling back to ramrod straightness. “Sir,” he said, then turned and all but fled into the alleyways behind the shop.  
沙德维尔的脸再次涨得通红，他匆忙后退，几乎绊倒了自己的脚，然后急忙恢复了笔直的姿势。"先生，"他说着，然后转身几乎是逃离了店后的小巷。

Aziraphale gave a small, contented sigh.  
亚齐拉费尔轻轻地叹了口气，心满意足。

Sometimes, one simply had to give into the temptation to play with them.  
有时候，一个人只是不得不屈服于与他们一起玩耍的诱惑。

Once the back of the shop was secured, Aziraphale returned to the front of the shop for a closer look at young Master Shadwell’s work. It had been well done to slip in under his guard, though if he was honest, he seldom paid that much attention to his security.  
一旦店后面得到保护，亚齐拉费尔回到店前，仔细观察年轻的沙德威尔大师的工作。他成功地悄悄溜进了他的防线，虽然说实话，他很少关注自己的安全。

He paused, his hand on the door handle.  
他停顿了一下，手放在门把手上。

Through the glass of the windows, he could see a familiar car.  
透过窗户的玻璃，他能看到一辆熟悉的汽车。

The dove-grey Bentley was gleaming, the flashing lights of the bars and strip clubs casting a rainbow of colours over it. And it was not alone. An angel was standing beside the car. No. He was leaning, sitting against the bonnet, his long legs stretching out in front of him, his dark suit making him a silhouette against the night. He was looking over his shoulder, his dark eyes gazing around the glittering street as if he had never seen it before.  
灰色的宾利闪闪发光，酒吧和脱衣舞俱乐部的闪烁灯光在其上投下五彩斑斓的色彩。而它并不孤单。一位天使站在车旁。不，他是倚靠在引擎盖上，长腿伸直，黑色西装使他在夜晚中成为一个剪影。他回过头，深邃的眼睛环顾着闪烁的街道，仿佛他从未见过这样的景象。

But then, he hadn’t, not in all its twilight splendour.  
但是，那时，他还没有，没有经历过它所有的黄昏辉煌。

Aziraphale smiled, opening his door at once. “Crowley! My dear boy! You should have knocked!”  
亚齐拉费尔微笑着，立刻打开了门。“克劳利！我亲爱的孩子！你应该敲门的！”

Crowley turned, his hair a shaggy mane around his face. “Aziraphale…” He didn’t look happy.  
克劳利转过身来，他的头发像一团蓬乱的鬃毛围绕着他的脸。“亚齐拉费尔……”他看起来并不开心。

Aziraphale frowned, stepping out onto the street. “Whatever has happened?”  
亚齐拉费尔皱了皱眉头，走出街道上。“到底发生了什么事？”

The angel pushed off from the car, straightening up, though the demon noticed that he didn’t step up onto the pavement, the wide flares of his trousers skimming the cobbles an inch away, as if the kerb was a line he feared to cross. But he had a bottle of wine in one hand, which usually boded well for an evening.  
天使从车上下来，挺直身子，尽管恶魔注意到他并没有踏上人行道，他宽大的裤腿只离鹅卵石一英寸远，好像路边是他不敢跨越的界线。但他手里拿着一瓶酒，通常这对一个晚上来说是个好兆头。

“You know I don’t live all that far away,” Crowley said hesitantly. “I’ve heard… things.”  
“你知道我住的地方并不远，”克劳利犹豫地说道。“我听说过一些事情。”

“Things?” Aziraphale prompted, puzzled.  
“东西？”亚齐拉费尔追问，感到困惑。

“About a church.” Ah. That explained the stricken look on the angel’s face. That old chestnut. “You can’t rob a church, Aziraphale. It’s too dangerous.”  
关于一座教堂。啊，这就解释了天使脸上那种痛苦的表情。老生常谈了。“你不能抢劫一座教堂，阿齐拉费尔。太危险了。”

Aziraphale pursed his lips. “Would you come inside, if we’re going to talk business?”  
亚齐拉费尔皱了皱嘴唇。“如果我们要谈生意，你愿意进来吗？”

Crowley glanced up at the shop front. “I probably shouldn’t,” he said.  
克劳利抬头看了一眼店铺门面。“我可能不应该这样做，”他说道。

It wasn’t the first time Aziraphale had asked, nor the first time the angel had refused, but honestly, was the exterior really so bad? All right, yes, perhaps several of the ornamental embellishments were a little on the lewd side, but he always believed in showing everyone precisely who he was, inside and out, and Crowley _knew_ that.  
这不是阿齐拉费尔第一次提出这个要求，也不是天使第一次拒绝，但说实话，外表真的那么糟糕吗？好吧，是的，也许有几个装饰有点淫秽，但他一直相信要向每个人展示他的真实内外，而克劳利知道这一点。

“So why have you come then?” he asked shortly. “To tell me what I ought not to do again? You told me your thoughts clearly enough a century ago, my dear. I don’t need to have you harping on at me.”  
"那你来干嘛呢？"他板着脸问道。"是来告诉我我又做错了什么吗？亲爱的，一百年前你已经清楚地表达了你的想法，我不需要你再唠叨给我听。"

Crowley shook his head. He looked pale, almost nervous. “You…” He hesitated, then held out the bottle of wine. “You don’t need to do it. Not now.”  
克劳利摇了摇头。他脸色苍白，几乎有些紧张。“你……”他犹豫了一下，然后递出了酒瓶。“你现在不需要这样做。”

Aziraphale stared at him, then at the bottle. “I don’t understand.”  
亚齐拉费尔盯着他，然后盯着瓶子。“我不明白。”

The angel’s lips trembled. “I didn’t have anything else to put it in,” he admitted. “No cork, though. Don’t want it to pop out and cause an accident. I’ve sealed it with rubber and wax. It won’t leak. It’ll– you’ll be safe.”  
天使的嘴唇颤抖着。“我没有其他东西可以装它，”他承认道。“没有软木塞，不想让它弹出来引发事故。我用橡胶和蜡密封了它。不会漏的。你会安全的。”

“It’s…” Aziraphale’s heart constricted. “Is this what I think it is?”  
“这是……”亚齐拉费尔的心紧缩了起来。“这是我想的那个吗？”

Crowley nodded, turning the bottle in his hands. “The holiest.”  
克劳利点了点头，手中转动着瓶子。“最神圣的。”

The world shook under Aziraphale’s feet. “That’s… but you said…”  
世界在亚齐拉菲尔的脚下震动了起来。“那…但是你说过…”

The angel nodded, giving him a small, heartbreaking smile. “I know. And I still don’t want to do it, but if it’s this or watching you risk your life on a maybe?” He shook his head, his eyes brilliantly bright. “I can’t do that.”  
天使点了点头，给了他一个微笑，带着一丝心碎。“我知道。我还是不想这样做，但如果只有这样，或者看着你冒着生命危险，可能会怎样？”他摇了摇头，眼睛闪烁着明亮的光芒。“我做不到。”

Aziraphale knew words. He knew many of them. Only they seemed to have forsaken him as he reached out and took the bottle from the angel’s shivering hands. “Can… hypothetically, could I thank you?”  
亚齐拉费尔懂得文字，他懂得很多。只是当他伸手从天使颤抖的手中接过瓶子时，这些文字似乎已经抛弃了他。“我能...假设地说，我可以感谢你吗？”

Crowley stepped back the moment the bottle was securely in Aziraphale’s grip. “Probably shouldn’t,” he said.  
克劳利一看到瓶子牢牢地被阿齐拉费尔抓住，他立刻退后了一步。“可能不应该这样做，”他说道。

Aziraphale nodded, cradling one hand reverently under the base of the bottle, the other tight around the neck. “Do– do you want to come in?”  
亚齐拉费尔点了点头，虔诚地将一只手放在瓶底下，另一只手紧紧握住瓶颈。“你...你想进来吗？”

Crowley shook his head, rubbing his palms anxiously together. “No. No, thanks.” He looked up and met Aziraphale’s eyes. “Not tonight.” His lips trembled and oh, the dear boy was trying so hard to smile. Lord, he was still so afraid. “Maybe you can pop round to watch telly some time. Or we can go to that restaurant you like. The Ritz, wasn’t it?”  
克劳利摇了摇头，焦虑地揉着双手。“不，谢谢。”他抬起头，与阿齐拉费尔的目光相遇。“今晚不行。”他的嘴唇颤抖着，可爱的男孩竭力试图微笑。天啊，他还是那么害怕。“也许你可以随时过来看电视，或者我们可以去你喜欢的那家餐厅。里茨酒店，对吧？”

Oh, Satan preserve him. 哦，撒旦保佑他。

“You know you’re welcome,” Aziraphale said as gently as he could. “Anytime you want, my door will always be open for you.”  
“你知道你随时都受欢迎的，”亚齐拉费尔尽量温柔地说道。“无论何时你想来，我的门永远为你敞开。”

Crowley nodded, then turned and moved back towards his car. Aziraphale watched, knowing there was nothing else he could say, as the angel climbed into the driver’s seat. He half-expected Crowley to drive away without another word, but the angel drummed his fingers on the steering wheel, then reached over and rolled down the window.  
克劳利点了点头，然后转身朝他的车走去。阿齐拉费尔看着，知道他已经没有别的话可说了，天使爬进了驾驶座。他半期待着克劳利会一言不发地开走，但天使却在方向盘上敲着手指，然后伸手过去摇下了车窗。

Aziraphale stepped down off the pavement, closer to him.  
亚齐拉费尔从人行道上走下来，靠近他。

Crowley looked at the bottle, then up at him with a small, oddly-shy smile. “You _do_ owe me a drink.”  
克劳利看着瓶子，然后微微地抬起头，露出一丝奇怪而害羞的微笑。“你确实欠我一杯酒。”

Before Aziraphale could speak, the car roared to life and he was left clutching the angel’s gift and unable to hide the wondering smile that spread across his face.  
在亚齐拉费尔开口之前，汽车轰鸣起来，他只能紧握着天使的礼物，无法掩饰脸上绽放的惊喜微笑。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

It was a mild night, dry and clear, but even so, a good denizen of Hell could always find something to complain about.  
这是一个温和的夜晚，干燥而清晰，但即便如此，地狱的居民总能找到一些抱怨的事情。

“Don’t see why we need to wait around for him,” Hastur grumbled. “He knew we would be coming. He should’ve been here.”  
“不明白为什么我们要等他，”哈斯特嘟囔着说。“他知道我们会来的，他本应该在这里。”

Lounging against a gravestone in the shadow of the church, Ligur nodded in agreement. “What’s he been getting up to up here, anyway? We never see him below these days.”  
站在教堂阴影下的墓碑旁，利古尔点头表示同意。“他到底在这里忙些什么？我们这些天从来没见过他在下面。”

Hastur scowled. “He runs a _bookshop_.” The last word was said with all the disdain usually applied to an infant school production of Swan Lake, without all the adorable chubby cheeks and tantrums. “And he eats human food. For pleasure!”  
哈斯特尔皱了皱眉头。“他经营一家书店。”最后一个词带着对幼儿园版《天鹅湖》演出通常表现出的轻蔑，只是没有可爱的圆圆脸蛋和发脾气。“而且他还吃人类食物。为了享受！”

Ligur shuddered. “Always enjoyed his food a bit too much, that one.”  
利古尔打了个寒颤。“那个人总是太过于享受他的食物。”

A hiss of laughter from above made them both look up in bewildered alarm to find a pair of sleepy blue eyes gazing back down at them, a serpent’s grin on the creature’s face. It coiled down around the tree’s trunk and at last, Aziraphale lazily curled around from behind the tree. He brushed loose leaves from his cream coat and checked himself fastidiously before looking at them.   
从上方传来的一阵嘶嘶笑声让他们俩惊慌地抬头望去，只见一双睡意朦胧的蓝眼睛注视着他们，蛇一般的笑容挂在那个生物的脸上。它盘绕着树干，最后，阿齐拉费尔慵懒地从树后面蜷缩而出。他从奶油色外套上拂去松散的叶子，仔细检查自己后才看向他们。

“Oh come now,” he said, pouting at them. “I don’t enjoy it too much. I enjoy it exactly the right amount.” He tilted his head from one side to the other, cracking his neck. “So, my dears, what the devil can I do for you?”  
“哎呀，别这样嘛，”他撅着嘴对他们说道。“我并不是太喜欢，我只是恰到好处地喜欢而已。”他把头一侧一侧地歪了歪，扭动了一下脖子。“那么，亲爱的，我能为你们做些什么？”

Hastur recovered first. It was always a nasty surprise to find the person you were talking about behind their back was in fact listening from above. A bit too much like, Heaven, that. “Hail Satan!” he declared, grateful when Ligur echoed him.  
哈斯特先恢复过来。发现你在背后谈论的人实际上在上面听着，总是令人不快的惊喜。有点像天堂，那样的感觉。“万岁撒旦！”他宣布，感激利古尔附和他。

Aziraphale waved a hand. “Mm. That.” He yawned pointedly, his jaw opening unnaturally wide, and Hastur made a face that closely resembled the rear end of a cat.  
亚齐拉费尔挥了挥手。“嗯，就是那个。”他故意打了个哈欠，嘴巴张得异常大，哈斯特则做出了一副非常像猫屁股的表情。

“Let us,” the demon snapped, “recount the deeds of the day.”  
“让我们来回顾一下今天的事迹。”恶魔厉声说道。

“Mm.” Aziraphale rolled his eyes. “Deeds.”  
“嗯。”亚齐拉费尔翻了个白眼。“行动。”

Hastur glared at him and if looks could have killed, Aziraphale certainly would have been more than mildly inconvenienced. “I’ve tempted a Priest,” he said proudly. “As he walked down the street, he saw all the pretty girls in the sun. I put doubt into his mind. He would’ve been a saint. Now, within a decade, we shall have him.”  
哈斯特怒视着他，如果眼神能杀人，阿齐拉费尔肯定会受到更多的不便之处。“我引诱了一位神父，”他自豪地说道。“当他走在街上时，看到阳光下的漂亮女孩。我在他的心中种下了怀疑。他本来会成为一个圣人。现在，不出十年，我们就能得到他。”

Ligur chuckled beside him approvingly, but Aziraphale merely smiled and hummed, as if he had heard better. Hastur scowled at him, nudging Ligur.  
利古尔在他旁边赞许地笑了笑，但阿齐拉费尔只是微笑着哼了一声，好像他听过更好的。哈斯特皱着眉头看着他，轻轻推了推利古尔。

“I,” Ligur said, glaring at Aziraphale on principle, “have corrupted a politician. Let him think a tiny bribe wouldn’t hurt. Within a year, we shall have him.”  
“我，”利古尔原则上怒视着阿齐拉费尔说道，“已经腐化了一位政治家。让他认为一点小小的贿赂不会有害。一年之内，我们就能掌握他。”

“Lovely,” Aziraphale said and while he was smiling, it also gave the impression of a rather dramatic eyeroll as well. “A politician? A dirty priest? Very original, my dears. Very… exciting new developments.”  
“可爱。”亚齐拉费尔说着，他的微笑中似乎还带着一丝戏剧性的翻白眼。“政客？腐败的神父？真是独创啊，亲爱的们。真是……令人激动的新发展。”

Hastur bared maggoty teeth. “And you, _Aziraphale_. What have you done?”  
哈斯特露出了蛆虫般的牙齿。“还有你，阿齐拉费尔。你做了什么？”

“Me?” Aziraphale’s teeth showed in something that was certainly not a smile. “Oh, I shut down the London Transport Network. It was rather impressive, actually. I even managed to ground most of the flights at the airport. Who knew that a few phone calls from the pub down the road and some silly accents would alarm the police so much?”  
“我？”阿齐拉费尔的牙齿露出了一丝绝非微笑的表情。“哦，我关闭了伦敦交通网络。实际上，那相当令人印象深刻。我甚至设法让机场的大部分航班停飞。谁知道从附近的酒吧打几个电话，模仿一些愚蠢的口音会让警察如此警觉呢？”

Hastur and Ligur exchanged glances.  
哈斯特尔和利古尔交换了一瞥。

“Yeah?” Hastur said. “And?”  
“是吗？”哈斯特问道。“然后呢？”

“Have you even _tried_ the Underground, my dear?” Aziraphale shuddered dramatically. “Awful, nasty little place, but it’s positively the heart of the city. Take away its heart and all other functions begin to fail.” He chuckled happily to himself. “What a shame that all the other options have ground to a halt as well.”  
“亲爱的，你有没有试过地铁呢？”亚齐拉费尔戏剧性地颤抖着说道。“可怕、恶心的小地方，但它绝对是城市的核心。一旦失去了核心，其他功能也会开始失效。”他开心地笑了起来。“可惜其他选择也都停滞不前。”

Hastur was not a demon who appreciated human things. Or humans at all for that matter. The last ‘underground’ vehicle he had encountered featured a small donkey and an equally small child. “So what? What has that done to secure souls for our Master?”  
哈斯特并不是一个欣赏人类事物的恶魔。事实上，他对人类一点兴趣都没有。他最后遇到的那辆“地下”交通工具上有一只小驴和一个同样小的孩子。“那又怎样？那对我们的主人有什么贡献呢？”

Aziraphale smiled like an angel. “Every commuter and traveller in the city stranded with no other alternatives? Oh, my dears, the chaos will be marvellous! So much anger. They’ll positively bubble over with wrath and envy for those lucky bastards in the taxis.” He gave a happy sigh. “Millions of souls, tarnishing one another a little more. Rather impressive if I do say so myself.”  
亚齐拉费尔笑得像个天使。“城市里的每个通勤者和旅行者都被困在这里，没有其他选择？哦，亲爱的，混乱将会是美妙的！那么多的愤怒。他们会因为那些幸运的混蛋们坐在出租车里而嫉妒得要命。”他满足地叹了口气。“数以百万计的灵魂，彼此之间更加玷污。如果我说得对的话，相当令人印象深刻。”

Ligur snorted. “It’s not exactly… craftsmanship, is it?”  
利古尔哼了一声。“这可不算是……手艺吧？”

“This, my dears, is what we call quantity over quality. Higher turnover, you see. Downstairs understand modern times require modern methods. Population booms and what have you. No wonder they adore me down there.” He took out his pocket watch and checked it. “So. Why are we here?”  
亲爱的们，这就是我们所说的量大于质量。你们看，更高的周转率。楼下明白现代时代需要现代方法。人口激增之类的。难怪他们那边如此崇拜我。"他拿出口袋里的怀表看了看。“那么，我们为什么在这里呢？”

Hastur smiled thinly. “This.”  
哈斯特微微一笑。“就是这个。”

Ligur picked up a picnic basket that was resting at his feet, holding it out.  
利古尔弯下腰，拿起脚边放着的野餐篮子，伸手递给对方。

It cannot be said that Aziraphale looked scared. He didn’t. But in all his many centuries on earth, he had never looked so apprehensive of a picnic basket before. “No…”  
不能说亚齐拉费尔看起来害怕。他并没有。但在他在地球上度过的漫长岁月中，他从未对一个野餐篮子如此忧虑过。“不……”

“Yes,” Ligur hissed with satisfaction.  
“是的，”利古尔满意地嘶声道。

“But surely that’s a long way off?”  
“但是肯定还有很长的路要走吧？”

“Not anymore,” Hastur sounded as pleased as Ligur. True, it was partly because of the contents of the basket, but there was also something very satisfying about wiping the smugness off the fair-haired demon’s face.  
“不再了。”哈斯特的语气和利古一样得意。诚然，这部分是因为篮子里的内容，但也有一种非常令人满意的感觉，可以抹去那个金发恶魔脸上的自鸣得意。

Aziraphale looked between them, then back at the basket. “I’m not sure I’m the best qualified to handle… that.”  
亚齐拉费尔看着他们两个，然后又看了看篮子。“我不确定我是否最适合处理……那个。”

“Oh, we’ve heard otherwise,” Ligur murmured, holding out the basket towards him. “You’re the one with the most practise with one of these.” He uncurled his fingers around the handle, holding it out, palm up. “Take it.”  
“哦，我们听说不一样的。”利古尔低声说着，将篮子递给他。“你是最有经验的人之一。”他松开手指，将篮子的把手伸出来，手心朝上。“拿着吧。”

The other demon’s hands hovered indecisively in front of his chest. “Why on earth would they pick me?” he demanded.  
另一个恶魔的手迟疑地悬停在他的胸前。“他们为什么会选择我？”他质问道。

“Modern times,” Hastur said, lips twitching, “require modern methods.” He extended a bill of delivery. “Sign.”  
“现代时代，”哈斯特说着，嘴角微微抽动，“需要现代方法。”他递出一张交货单。“签字。”

Aziraphale hesitated, then slashed the tip of his thumbnail along his fingertip, marking a sigil in a scorching drop of dark blood. It sizzled on the paper, scoring the mark deeper than the page.  
亚齐拉费尔犹豫了一下，然后用指甲尖划过指尖，用一滴炽热的黑血在纸上刻下一个符号。它在纸上嗤嗤作响，将符号刻得比纸张更深。

He straightened up, glancing warily between them. “What now?”  
他挺直了身子，警惕地在他们之间扫了一眼。“现在怎么办？”

Ligur pressed the basket into his hand as Hastur smiled and said, “You will receive your instructions.” His eyes glittered. “The moment we’ve been working for all these centuries is at hand!”  
利古尔把篮子塞进他的手中，哈斯图尔微笑着说：“你将收到你的指示。”他的眼睛闪闪发光。“我们几个世纪以来一直在努力的时刻终于到来了！”

“Mm.” Aziraphale said noncommittally, shifting the weight of the basket in his grip.  
“嗯。”亚齐拉费尔不置可否地说着，调整着手中篮子的重量。

“Your moment of eternal triumph awaits,” Ligur added.  
“你永恒胜利的时刻即将到来，”利古尔补充道。

“I see.” “我明白了。”

“And you,” Hastur finished, “will be a tool of that glorious destiny.”  
“而你，”哈斯特结束道，“将成为那个辉煌命运的工具。”

The fair demon looked down at the basket. “I expect so,” he said, then flashed a smile that was all teeth. “Best be off then, my dears. Wouldn’t want to… disappoint anyone.”  
公平的恶魔低头看着篮子。“我想是的，”他说着，然后露出了一丝全是牙齿的微笑。“那么，我最好走了，亲爱的们。可不想……让任何人失望。”

“And Aziraphale,” Ligur called after him. “Try not to get peckish on the way.”  
“还有，阿齐拉费尔，”利古在他身后喊道。“路上别饿坏了。”

Aziraphale shot a thin smile over his shoulder. “Oh don’t worry, my dear,” he called, as he wove between the headstones. “I think the contents of this one might disagree with me if I tried.”  
亚齐拉费尔朝后微微一笑。“哦，别担心，亲爱的，”他边穿过墓碑间穿梭，边说道。“如果我尝试的话，我想这个里面的东西可能会不同意我。”

He wound his way back out of the cemetery and into the village, resisting the urge to open up the nearest manhole cover and tip the contents of the basket down it.  
他蜿蜒穿过墓地，回到了村庄，抑制住了打开最近的下水道盖子，将篮子里的东西倒进去的冲动。

Aziraphale was many things, but suicidally foolish was not one of them. The basket had to be delivered or his neck would be on the line. And if he didn’t deliver it, then someone else inevitably would while he paid for his dereliction of duty in the lowest pit.  
亚齐拉费尔是许多事情，但自杀般愚蠢绝对不是其中之一。这个篮子必须被送出去，否则他的脖子就会受到威胁。如果他不去送，那么必然会有其他人代替他，而他将为自己的失职付出最惨痛的代价。

To anyone who saw him passing, Aziraphale looked like an amiable gentleman of a certain age out for a pleasant evening stroll. However, anyone unfortunate enough to pass by him would have been shocked by the litany of muttered profanities rolling off his tongue in a dozen languages.  
对于任何看到他经过的人来说，阿齐拉费尔看起来像是一个友善的中年绅士，正在愉快地散步。然而，任何不幸经过他身边的人都会被他口中用十几种语言咕哝出的一连串亵渎言辞所震惊。

“Why me?” he demanded under his breath as he hurried back into the pub. “What the hell have I done?”  
“为什么是我？”他小声咒骂着，匆匆赶回酒吧。“我到底做了什么？”

“Oh, you know what you’ve done, Aziraphale.” He spun around to see the presenter on Match of the Day smiling down at him from the television above the bar. “The M25. The Underground. Terminal Five at Heathrow. All your little technological innovations to make the world a little worse.”  
"哦，你知道你做了什么，阿齐拉费尔。"他转过身，看到《当天的比赛》的主持人从酒吧上方的电视屏幕上冲着他微笑着说道。"M25高速公路，地铁，希思罗机场的5号航站楼。你的所有小小的技术创新都让世界变得更糟糕了一点点。"

Ah. He tightened his grip on the basket, wonder how they would react if they knew a certain angel had actually been responsible for those little circles of Hell on earth, two of them completely accidentally.  
啊。他紧紧地握住篮子，不知道他们会有什么反应，如果他们知道一个特定的天使实际上是那些地狱般的小圈子的罪魁祸首，其中两个完全是意外的。

“Here,” Gary Lineker said, beaming at him, “are your instructions.”  
“这里，”加里·莱因克尔笑着对他说道，“是你的指示。”

The information sleeted into his brain, making his world spin, and he staggered, leaning heavily against the nearest table.  
信息涌入他的脑海，让他的世界旋转起来，他踉跄着，沉重地靠在最近的桌子上。

“You all right, mate?” the occupant inquired, looking up at him.  
“你还好吗，伙计？”住户询问道，抬头看着他。

Aziraphale stared at him then nodded. “Come with me,” he said, snapping his fingers. “We need to go for a little drive.”  
亚齐拉费尔盯着他看了一会儿，然后点了点头。“跟我来，”他说着，弹了弹手指。“我们需要去兜个风。”

The human rose, abandoning his pint, and followed him.  
人类玫瑰，放下他的啤酒，跟着他走了。

A show was still going on in the hall and Crowley smiled as voices lifted, singing along with the enthusiastic – although not exactly – in-tune guitar. Light was pouring out of the tall windows of the building, illuminating him as he worked his way along the bonnet of the Bentley.  
大厅里的演出仍在进行，克劳利微笑着，随着热情（虽然不完全）不协调的吉他声，人们的声音也跟着响起。高大的窗户透出的光线照亮了他，他一边沿着宾利的引擎盖工作。

He could’ve done it with a miracle, but sometimes, he enjoyed the physical effort of it all. It wasn’t as if it really needed to be cleaned and polished so often, but he liked it and it wasn’t as if he’d even be able to hear his telly over the sound of music from the main hall.  
他本可以用奇迹完成，但有时候，他喜欢付出体力的努力。虽然并不是真的需要经常清洁和擦亮，但他喜欢这样做，而且他在主厅里的音乐声中，根本听不到电视的声音。

Not that he minded. That was why he’d converted the building to begin with: the main body of the former church was the local community centre and always packed with people doing some kind of good, while the attached chapter house had his big squashy couch, his wide-screen telly and a good selection of wine stored in the eaves. It was small and snug, but he liked it that way.  
并不是他介意。这就是为什么他一开始就把这座建筑改造了：前教堂的主体是当地的社区中心，总是挤满了人们做一些善事，而附属的教堂会所有他那个大沙发、宽屏电视和一些存放在屋檐下的好酒。虽然小而温馨，但他喜欢这样。

He dabbed his cloth into the tin of wax, then set to work on the left side of the bonnet, humming along with the tune from the hall.  
他将布蘸入蜡罐中，然后开始在引擎盖的左侧工作，一边哼着大厅里的曲调。

A shimmer of light reflected in the windscreen made him whip round, his foot catching on his ankle, and he stumbled back against the edge of the bonnet at the sight of the creature standing an arm’s length away from him, looking like the embodiment of sophistication in perfectly-tailored suit.  
一道光芒在挡风玻璃上闪烁，他猛地转身，脚绊到了脚踝，他惊讶地向后跌倒，撞到了引擎盖边缘，眼前的生物离他只有一臂之遥，穿着一套完美剪裁的西装，看起来充满了优雅与精致。

“Gabriel!” He tried to gather his scattered wits. “Uh. Hi?”  
“加布里埃尔！”他努力集中自己散乱的思绪。“嗯。嗨？”

“Am I interrupting, Raziel?” The Archangel gave him a placid smile, which did nothing to stop Crowley’s heart from racing. How long had it been since he’d heard someone call him by that name? A couple of hundred years, give or take? And Gabriel never really showed up for any good reason, did he? Crowley frantically riffled through his most recent good and bad deeds, wondering if or when he’d slipped up or if–  
“我打扰到你了吗，拉齐尔？”大天使微笑着，但这并不能阻止克劳利的心跳加速。自从他上次听到有人称呼他这个名字已经过了多久了？大概几百年吧，或多或少？而加百列从来没有真正为了什么好理由出现过，是吧？克劳利疯狂地回忆着自己最近的善行和恶行，想知道自己是否犯了错误，或者何时犯了错误，或者是否-

“–doing to that thing?” “-在做那件事情？”

He blinked, tuning back into the archangel’s words. “What?”🔄  ❓

Gabriel pointed to the cloth in his hand, then to the car. “What are you doing to that thing?”  
加布里埃尔指着手中的布料，然后指向汽车。“你在对那个东西做什么？”

Crowley reached back to protectively lay a hand on the Bentley. “I-I’m waxing it. It keeps it looking its best.”  
克劳利伸手保护性地放在宾利车上。“我，我在给它打蜡。这样它看起来最好。”

“It’s just a few pieces of metal,” Gabriel said with disdain. “You use… manual labour for such a trivial thing?”  
“这只是几块金属而已。”加布里埃尔不屑地说道。“你竟然还要用…人工劳动来做这种琐碎的事情？”

Crowley wanted to argue it was much more than that, but he bit his tongue.  
克劳利想要辩论这不仅仅是那样，但他咬住了舌头。

He’d been on the wrong side of the Archangel before – several of them, actually – and he didn’t want to risk it again. They’d never really liked him after the incident with his Book, all those millennia ago. Knowledge, they furiously told him, should not have been given to talking monkeys, especially not monkeys who had been tempted into sin and abandoned God’s grace.  
他以前曾经得罪过大天使，实际上是几个大天使，他不想再冒险了。在那些千年前，他的书出事之后，他们从来就不喜欢他。他们愤怒地告诉他，知识不应该被赋予会说话的猴子，尤其是那些被引诱入罪恶并且背弃了上帝恩典的猴子。

Funny how God seemed to take his side on that occasion and the Book of knowledge mysteriously found its way from the bottom of the sea and back into the hands of those lovely little monkeys, who had gone on to be curious and clever enough to figure out a combustion engine and build a gorgeous thing like a Bentley.  
有趣的是，上帝似乎在那个场合站在他这一边，知识之书神秘地从海底找回到那些可爱的小猴子手中，它们继续保持好奇和聪明，足够聪明地发明了内燃机，并建造出像宾利这样华丽的东西。

Still, it had been easier to stay on earth after that, instead of dealing with sideways looks and snide comments. Making amends through his labours, they called it. Exile, they called it. Staying out of their way and getting on with his work, he called it.  
然而，自那以后，留在地球上反而更容易，而不是面对斜视和讽刺的评论。他们称之为通过努力来弥补过错。他们称之为流放。他称之为远离他们的道路，专心工作。

He did wonder, though, how they’d react if they found out which bookshop currently had the most recent copy of the Book. Snide comments would probably get a bit more pointed and sharp and probably flaming.  
然而，他确实在想，如果他们发现哪家书店目前有最新的《书》副本，他们会有什么反应。嘲讽的评论可能会变得更加尖锐和刻薄，甚至可能引起激烈的争论。

“Well…” he managed to say. “S’a car, isn’t it? Humans need them to get about. Helps me blend in a bit.” Which, he had to admit was a spectacular lie. A vintage Bentley drew eyes wherever it went, and he’d be lying even more if he didn’t love to see the looks on peoples’ faces as he sped by.  
“嗯……”他勉强说道。“这是辆车，不是吗？人类需要它们来出行。这样我就能有点融入了。”他不得不承认，这是个了不起的谎言。一辆古董宾利无论走到哪里都会引起人们的注意，如果他不承认自己喜欢看到人们脸上的表情在他飞驰而过时，那就更是在说谎了。

Gabriel smiled angelically. “At least you won’t need to worry about that much longer.”  
加布里埃尔天使般地微笑着。“至少你不再需要担心那么久了。”

Crowley’s stomach dropped like a stone. “I won’t?”  
克劳利的胃像石头一样下沉了下去。“我不会？”

The Archangel leaned closer. “We have reliable information that things are afoot.”  
大天使靠近了一些。“我们有可靠的信息，事情正在酝酿中。”

“Yeah?” Crowley’s voice came out as a croak.  
“是吗？”克劳利的声音嘶哑地传出来。

Gabriel nodded. “Yes. My informants suggest the demon – Aziraphale? – may be involved.”  
加布里埃尔点了点头。“是的。我的线人暗示恶魔——阿齐拉费尔？——可能涉及其中。”

Crowley groaned inwardly. If Aziraphale was already back on Heaven’s radar, that wasn’t good.  
克劳利内心不禁叹息。如果阿齐拉费尔已经再次引起了天堂的注意，那可不妙。

“You need to keep him under observation,” Gabriel continued, “without, of course, letting him know that’s what you’re doing.”  
“你需要对他进行观察，”加布里埃尔继续说道，“当然，不要让他知道你在这样做。”

Crowley forced a strained smile. “That’s what I stayed here since Eden,” he said, wondering when it had become so easy to lie to the denizens of Heaven. Probably, he thought wryly, about the time he had started performing temptations. “To keep an eye on him.”  
克劳利勉强笑了笑。“这就是我自从伊甸园以来一直待在这里的原因，”他说着，心里想着何时对天堂居民撒谎变得如此容易。他苦笑着想，大概是从他开始进行诱惑的时候吧。“为了照看他。”

“Hm.” Gabriel nodded. “It’s a miracle he hasn’t spotted you in all that time.” Crowley’s heart did a flip of panic. Did they know? Had they realised? Was it– Then Gabriel laughed and clapped his hands together. “But miracles are what we do!”  
“嗯。”加百列点了点头。“他竟然在那么长时间里没有发现你，真是个奇迹。”克劳利的心猛地一跳，感到恐慌。他们知道吗？他们意识到了吗？难道是——然后加百列笑了起来，拍了拍手。“但奇迹就是我们所做的事情！”

Crowley managed a watery smile. “Mm.”  
克劳利勉强露出了一个苦笑。“嗯。”

The Archangel didn’t seem to notice his discomfort. “I’m sure you’ll keep up the good work,” he said approvingly. “You’ve made great strides, given where you started.”  
大天使似乎没有注意到他的不适。“我相信你会继续做得很好，”他赞许地说道。“考虑到你的起点，你已经取得了巨大的进步。”

Amazing how a compliment could be delivered like a slap in the face.  
真是令人惊讶，一个赞美竟然能像一记耳光一样打在脸上。

Crowley nodded and smiled as if he meant it, only the Bentley holding him steady as Gabriel turned and strode away into the darkness.  
克劳利点了点头，微笑着，仿佛他是认真的，只有宾利车稳稳地托住他，而加百列则转身大步走向黑暗中。

As soon as he was out of sight, Crowley sagged back to sit on the bonnet of the car, pressing a trembling hand to the metal. “Oh, Aziraphale,” he breathed. “What the Hell have you done?”  
他一离开视线，克劳利就松懈地坐在汽车的引擎盖上，颤抖着的手紧贴着金属。“哦，阿齐拉费尔，”他喃喃自语。“你到底做了什么？”

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Aziraphale drummed his fingers on the handle of the picnic basket on the seat beside him as the world whizzed by.  
亚齐拉费尔在旁边的座位上敲着野餐篮子的把手，眼看着世界飞速掠过。

The man from the pub – Tom, keen footballer, married with a bit on the side – was silent with his eyes on the road. It was always a bother to… borrow people like that, especially when he had to concentrate to keep them on track, but Aziraphale had never had the inclination to try driving himself. He had always hated cars. And buses. And trains. And quite frankly, anything that moved at more than a rapid trot.  
从酒吧来的那个男人——汤姆，热衷于足球，已婚但有个小情人——默默地盯着前方的道路。像这样借用别人总是麻烦，尤其是当他必须集中注意力来保持他们在正确的轨道上时，但是阿齐拉费尔从来没有想过自己开车。他一直讨厌汽车。还有公共汽车。火车也一样。坦白说，任何速度超过快速小跑的东西他都不喜欢。

Still, sometimes needs must.  
有时候，情况所迫。

It had taken an hour so far and they’d just passed through a small village and were on their way to the hospital that was Aziraphale’s designated delivery point.  
到目前为止已经过去了一个小时，他们刚刚经过了一个小村庄，正在前往阿齐拉费尔指定的医院交付点的路上。

The basket had wailed briefly, but he ignored it, his mind racing.  
篮子发出了一声短暂的哀鸣，但他无视了它，脑海中思绪万千。

They’d always known it was coming. Well, he had at least. He’d been trying to find a way around it for years and now, here he was with the bloody Antichrist in a basket beside him. Of all the people to be given the responsibility for setting it all in motion, he was probably the only demon in Hell who would rather have bitten off his own foot.  
他们一直都知道这一天会来临。至少他知道。多年来，他一直试图找到绕过这一切的方法，现在，他坐在旁边的篮子里，有着该死的末日使者。在所有被赋予推动这一切的责任的人中，他可能是地狱中唯一宁愿咬掉自己脚的恶魔。

God, he thought bitterly, and her ineffable sense of humour at play.  
天啊，他心中苦涩地想道，她那难以言喻的幽默感又在发挥作用了。

Crowley. He’d need to tell Crowley. There had to be something they could do about it.  
克劳利。他需要告诉克劳利。他们肯定能够想出办法解决这个问题。

The car swung in to a wide courtyard, framed by buildings that looked like old-fashioned cloisters. Tom braked the car and remained seated, motionless.  
汽车转进了一个宽敞的庭院，四周是看起来像老式回廊的建筑物。汤姆踩下刹车，坐在车里一动不动。

So, this was it, was it?  
这就是了，是吗？

Reluctantly, Aziraphale got out of the car, pulling the basket with him. This was the last chance he had to whirl it over his head and lob it into the sky, but that niggling worm of self-preservation really, really wanted to keep on living. At least long enough to try to keep everything from ending.  
阿齐拉费尔勉强下了车，带着篮子走了出来。这是他最后一次将篮子高高举过头顶，扔向天空的机会，但那个顽固的自我保护的小虫子真的非常非常想继续活下去。至少要活得足够长的时间，试图阻止一切的终结。

He gave the basket a last glare, then stalked towards the doors where a stout, dark-haired man was standing. He was an ordinary-looking fellow wearing a pullover and smoking a pipe, not a demon or one of their people that Aziraphale recognised, but then it took all sorts.  
他狠狠地瞪了一眼篮子，然后朝着门口走去，那里站着一个身材魁梧、黑发的男人。他看起来很普通，穿着一件套头衫，抽着烟斗，既不是恶魔，也不是亚齐拉费尔认识的那些人，但是世界上什么人都有。

“Has it started already?” he demanded as he neared.  
他接近时，他要求：“已经开始了吗？”

The man nodded with a pained smile. “They told me to wait outside.”  
那个男人苦笑着点了点头。“他们告诉我在外面等。”

Of course. No witnesses. 当然。没有目击者。

“Where are we then?” he asked, as he strode by towards the door.  
“那我们现在在哪里？”他问道，一边大步走向门口。

“Room three, doctor!” 三号房间，医生！

The halls were deserted as he strode onwards, until he emerged in a vast lobby with a gargantuan statue of a man wrestling a serpent. He paused, considering it, trying to recall any occasion when he might have posed for something like that, when he heard a squeak of surprise.  
当他大步向前走时，大厅里空无一人，直到他来到一个巨大的大厅，里面有一座巨大的雕像，描绘着一个人与一条巨蛇搏斗。他停下脚步，仔细观察着，试图回忆起自己是否曾经为类似的事情摆过姿势，就在这时，他听到了一声惊讶的尖叫。

“Master Aziraphale!” “阿齐拉费尔大师！”

He turned to see a nun staring at him, fizzing with delight, a beaming smile on her face.  
他转过身，看到一位目不转睛、满脸喜悦的修女，脸上洋溢着灿烂的微笑。

With considerable effort, he made himself hold out the basket. “You’ll be expecting this, I suppose.”  
费了很大的努力，他让自己坚持拿出了篮子。“我想你应该期待着这个。”

The nun nodded eagerly, snatching it from his hand. She flipped open one of the lids and despite himself, Aziraphale looked down to see a tiny, utterly normal-looking, very pink, sneezing baby.  
那位修女热切地点了点头，从他手中抢过来。她翻开其中一个盖子，尽管他自己也不由自主地低头看到了一个非常小、看起来完全正常、非常粉红、打喷嚏的婴儿。

“Is it really him?” she asked, wide-eyed.  
“真的是他吗？”她瞪大眼睛问道。

“Mm.” “嗯。”

She laughed in delight. “I’d’ve expected funny eyes or teensy weensy little hoofikins or a widdle tail.”  
她开心地笑了起来。“我本来以为会有好笑的眼睛，或者小小的蹄子，或者一个小尾巴。”

Aziraphale pinched the bridge of his nose. Satanists were always such a… special group of people. “It’s certainly him.”  
亚齐拉费尔捏了捏鼻梁。撒旦教徒总是那么特别的一群人。“肯定是他。”

The nun positively glowed. “Fancy me holding the antichrist, counting his little toesie-woesies!”  
那位修女散发着积极的光芒。“想象一下，我居然抱着那个反基督者，数着他的小脚趾宝贝！”

“Oh for Satan’s sake…” Aziraphale groaned under his breath.  
“哦，见鬼…” 阿齐拉费尔嘴里嘟囔着。

“Do you look like your daddy?” The nun continued to coo, rocking the basket gently. “Do you look like your daddy-waddi-kins?”  
“你长得像你爸爸吗？”修女继续轻声地说着，轻轻摇晃着篮子。“你长得像你爸爸吗，宝贝？”

“Of course he doesn’t,” Aziraphale snapped. “Take him up to room three.”  
“当然他不会，”阿齐拉费尔厉声说道。“把他带到三号房间。”

He turned, striding away, wondering if anyone would suspect him if the whole damn place ended up in flames. After all, the baby had been delivered. Who could fault him if faulty wiring wiped him and all those around him out in a freak tragic fire?  
他转身离开，大步走开，心里想着如果整个该死的地方最终变成一片火海，会不会有人怀疑他。毕竟，孩子已经出生了。如果有故障的电线引发了一场悲剧性的火灾，谁能责怪他和周围的人呢？

Oh, but they’d know. They’d have eyes on the place. They would check and then…  
哦，但他们会知道的。他们会派人监视那个地方。他们会检查，然后...

No. He had to walk away.  
不，他不得不离开。

He headed for the doors.  
他朝着门走去。

Outside, the night was cool and quiet. Pullover man was gone, probably back indoors now that the baby was safely delivered.  
外面，夜晚凉爽而宁静。穿着套头衫的男人已经离开了，可能是因为宝宝已经安全出生，现在回到了室内。

Aziraphale shoved his hands in his pockets and breathed out a chilly breath towards the night sky.  
亚齐拉费尔将双手插进口袋，向夜空吐出一口寒气。

All right, then. That was that. The clock was ticking.  
好的，那就这样吧。时间在流逝。

First things first, he needed to get back to London and let Crowley know what was happening and then–  
首先，他需要回到伦敦，告诉克劳利发生了什么事情，然后-

He paused, frowning. There was a distinctly vacant space where he’d left his unwitting taxi.  
他停下来，皱着眉头。他无意中离开的出租车停在了一个明显空荡荡的地方。

“Oh for Satan’s sake, Tom!” he snarled. Lose concentration for five seconds and what happened? The bloody man had taken it into his head to bugger off home. He stared around at the other cars, but there wasn’t a soul to be seen. All inside, he suspected, watching the birth of the Ambassador’s hellspawn.  
“哦，见鬼的，汤姆！”他咆哮道。只是分神了五秒钟，发生了什么？这该死的家伙竟然决定回家了。他环顾四周的其他车辆，但一个人都看不见。他怀疑他们都在里面，目睹大使的恶魔后代的诞生。

It took a flare of a miracle to get him back to the village, which he always hated doing for such short stints. They could be so exhausting sometimes. At least the village had a bus stop there. He’d seen it. And if that failed, there was bound to be someone in the village he could borrow.  
用一点奇迹才能让他回到他一直讨厌的村庄，只是为了那么短的时间。有时候这样真的很累人。至少村庄那里有一个公交车站。他看到过。如果那个不行，村里肯定有人可以借用。

The trouble was that it was close to midnight and it was a God-damned village with a single street and sod all else. A makeshift poster had been sellotaped onto the bus stop and he stared at it in dismay: All buses had been cancelled for the day due to network difficulties in London.  
问题是，现在已经接近午夜了，而这个该死的村庄只有一条街，其他什么都没有。一个临时的海报被用胶带粘在公交车站上，他沮丧地盯着它看：由于伦敦网络故障，所有公交车今天都取消了。

“Oh, you silly bastard,” he groaned. He turned on the spot, looking around. No people about either, not even a cat or dog or _something_.  
"哦，你这个傻瓜，"他呻吟着。他原地转了一圈，四处张望。周围没有人，甚至连一只猫或狗都没有。

There was, thankfully, a telephone box and only one number he knew he could call.  
幸运的是，那里有一个电话亭，他知道只有一个号码可以拨打。

He dialled, not even bothering putting any coins in, and waited.  
他拨了号码，甚至都懒得投硬币，然后等待着。

“Hello?” Crowley’s voice was barely audible over the sound of music. “Who’s this?”  
“喂？”克劳利的声音在音乐声中几乎听不见。“你是谁？”

“Hello, my dear.” 你好，亲爱的。

There was a pause. “Aziraphale.”  
有一段停顿。“阿兹拉菲尔。”

Aziraphale glanced along the empty abandoned streets. “I’m in a bit of a pickle.”  
亚齐拉费尔朝着空荡荡的废弃街道扫了一眼。“我有点麻烦了。”

“Yeah?” The angel sounded oddly reticent. “What do you need?”  
"是吗？" 天使的声音听起来有些不情愿。"你需要什么？"

Aziraphale sighed with relief. “Would you be able to give me a lift?”  
亚齐拉费尔松了口气。“你能载我一程吗？”

A small flock of ducks had gathered in front of Crowley as he distractedly scattered handful of feed for them. St. James’s Park was as busy as always, but he didn’t need to look when footsteps approached him.  
当克劳利心不在焉地撒了一把饲料给一群小鸭子时，它们聚集在他面前。圣詹姆斯公园一如既往地熙熙攘攘，但当有人脚步靠近时，他无需抬头看。

“You’re early, my dear.” 亲爱的，你来得很早。

Crowley nodded, flicking another handful of food for the eager ducks. “The taxi found you, then?”  
克劳利点了点头，又撒了一把食物给渴望的鸭子们。“出租车找到你了，是吗？”

“Clearly,” Aziraphale replied, standing alongside him. “I didn’t realise you were occupied.”  
“显然，”阿齐拉费尔回答道，站在他旁边。“我没意识到你正忙着。”

Crowley couldn’t work out why he’d lied. They needed to talk about what was going on, but he– it was all– how was he meant to process what he needed to when Aziraphale would be… well… himself? The demon didn’t make it easy to think vast and terrifying thoughts, especially not about something important.  
克劳利无法理解自己为什么撒谎了。他们需要谈论正在发生的事情，但他——一切都——当亚齐拉费尔会……嗯……保持他自己的时候，他该如何处理自己所需的事情呢？这个恶魔并不容易让人思考广阔而可怕的想法，尤其是对于一些重要的事情。

Crowley had just needed a few extra hours to grasp the magnitude of the thought sitting in his head: Armageddon. Coming soon. Not in centuries, but in little more than a decade.  
克劳利只需要多几个小时来理解他脑海中的想法的重要性：末日。即将来临。不是在几个世纪之后，而是在十多年之内。

No, it wasn’t just that. It was Gabriel as well. Gabriel always rattled him. It was daft how much checking in with his home team could knot his insides and make him head for the bottle as well.  
不，不仅仅是那样。还有加布里埃尔。加布里埃尔总是让他心烦意乱。真是愚蠢，他与家人保持联系竟然能让他的内心紧绷，让他也变得沉溺于瓶中之酒。

So he’d dispatched a taxi to a village in the middle of nowhere to pick the demon up, locked the door of his home and thought about Armageddon until it grew too tempting to run headfirst at a wall. It took about fifteen minutes. With that awesomely horrifying weight in his head, he sank a full bottle of a fruity Merlot before falling asleep on the couch.  
所以他派了一辆出租车去一个偏远的村庄接那个恶魔，锁上了家门，然后一直想着世界末日，直到忍不住想要头撞墙。大约花了十五分钟。带着那种可怕而沉重的负担，他喝下了一整瓶果味梅洛红酒，然后在沙发上睡着了。

“So…” Aziraphale rocked on the balls of his feet. “What are we going to do?”  
“那么……”亚齐拉费尔踮起脚尖，摇晃着身体。“我们要做什么呢？”

Crowley’s fingers clenched convulsively. The bag of seed burst, causing a free-for-all at his feet. “Do? What’s there to _do_? It’s the divine plan!”  
克劳利的手指痉挛地握紧了。种子袋破裂了，导致他脚下一片混乱。“做什么？还能做什么？这是神圣的计划！”

“To Hell with that,” Aziraphale snapped.  
“见鬼去吧。”阿齐拉费尔厉声说道。

Crowley looked at him, startled. Aziraphale was many things, but actively rebellious was rarely part of it.  
克劳利惊讶地看着他。阿齐拉费尔是许多事情，但积极反叛很少是其中之一。

“It was bound to happen eventually,” he said, as much as he hated to admit it. “Heaven will triumph over Hell and everything…” He trailed off at the look of contempt on the demon’s face. “Look, we _will_ win! You know we will!”  
“迟早会发生的，”他说道，尽管他不愿承认。“天堂将战胜地狱，一切都会……”他看到恶魔脸上的蔑视表情，话语戛然而止。“听着，我们会赢的！你知道我们会的！”

“Frankly,” Aziraphale said bluntly, “I don’t give a damn which side wins. It _shouldn’t_ happen.” He leaned oppressively close. “And I know for a fact you _don’t_ want it to happen.”  
“坦白说，”阿齐拉费尔直言不讳地说道，“我才不在乎哪一方胜利。这本不应该发生。”他压得近了些。“而且我确信你也不希望这发生。”

Crowley looked away from him, flushing. “What I want doesn’t matter,” he mumbled, tangling his fingers so tightly they ached. “It’s divine, so I have to do it. Heaven’s orders and all that.”  
克劳利转过头去，脸红了起来。“我想要的并不重要，”他嘟囔着，手指交织在一起，紧紧地握着，以至于感到疼痛。“这是神圣的事情，所以我必须去做。天堂的命令，诸如此类。”

“Mm. Yes. Oh, so convincing.” The demon snorted. “What do you think they’re going to do to your precious humans when the war is done? Heaven _or_ Hell? Do you think they’ll just say ‘oh, continue living your busy little lives, don’t mind us’?” He shook his head. “They’re gone. Done.” He waved a hand expansively. “This planet. Every person here. Every _duck_ here will be gone. Obliterated by the Divine Plan.”  
“嗯，是的。哦，真是令人信服。”恶魔哼了一声。“你认为战争结束后，他们会对你心爱的人类做什么？天堂还是地狱？你认为他们会说‘哦，继续过着忙碌的小生活吧，不要理会我们’？”他摇了摇头。“他们已经消失了。完了。”他大大地挥了挥手。“这个星球。这里的每个人。这里的每只鸭子都将消失。被神圣计划抹去。”

Crowley flinched. “I can’t go against Heaven’s will,” he said. “I-I’ve done it before. It doesn’t end well.”  
克劳利畏缩了一下。“我不能违背天堂的意愿，”他说。“我-我以前做过，结果不好。”

“Oh yes,” Aziraphale said disdainfully. “You got that strongly-worded letter.”  
“哦，是的，”阿齐拉费尔不屑地说道。“你收到那封措辞强烈的信了。”

Crowley clenched his hands more tightly. Oh, the demon had no idea. “Why do you care anyway?” he demanded, trying not to let his imagination take him to the places where the Archangels came for him again. They’d wanted him punished then, but Divine Will was Divine Will and you didn’t argue with it. Not when God apparently wanted the monkeys to learn.  
克劳利更紧紧地握紧了双手。哦，那个恶魔根本不知道。"你为什么在意呢？"他要求道，努力不让自己的想象带他回到大天使再次来找他的地方。他们当时想要惩罚他，但神圣的旨意是神圣的旨意，你不能与之争论。尤其是当上帝显然希望猴子们学习的时候。

“Why shouldn’t I?” Aziraphale demanded. “All my things are here. All the best restaurants. Don’t you remember how vile the food in Heaven was before the first war?”  
“为什么我不能呢？”亚齐拉费尔要求道。“我所有的东西都在这里。所有最好的餐馆。难道你不记得第一次战争之前天堂的食物有多么恶心吗？”

“Oh, of course,” Crowley snapped. “It’s always selfish with you.”  
“哦，当然了，”克劳利厉声说道。“你总是这么自私。”

The demon gave him a blank look. “Obviously.”  
恶魔面无表情地看着他。“显然。”

Crowley threw up his hands. “I’m not talking about this with you. I _can’t_.” He turned and hurried away, surprised when Aziraphale trotted along after him.  
克劳利举起双手。“我不想和你谈论这个。我不能。”他转身匆匆离开，惊讶地发现亚齐拉费尔跟在他后面小跑着。

“I’m not saying we storm the gates of Heaven and Hell or anything,” he said reasonably. “Look, we have eleven years before it happens. That’s plenty of time to do something.”  
“我不是说我们要冲击天堂和地狱的大门或者什么的，”他理智地说道。“看，我们还有十一个年的时间来做些什么。那足够了。”

“No!” Crowley ran up the steps towards Horseguards, screeching to a halt when the demon materialised in front of him. “Aziraphale! Stop it!”  
“不！”克劳利沿着楼梯跑向卫兵马队，当恶魔在他面前显现出来时，他突然停了下来。“亚齐拉费尔！别这样！”

The demon held up his hands, his face creased in worry. “All right, all right.” He gave Crowley a careful smile. “How about I get you a drink at least?” He raised his eyebrows hopefully. “I still owe you one, don’t I?”  
恶魔举起双手，脸上带着忧虑的皱纹。“好吧，好吧。”他小心地对克劳利微笑。“至少我给你倒杯饮料怎么样？”他希望地挑起眉毛。“我还欠你一个，对吧？”

Crowley felt like he had been deflated by those words. An echo of another little deed, an act against the will of Heaven, one of his many, many, many little indiscretions. And now a last indulgence before it was all too late. “Yeah,” he murmured, nodding. “You do.”  
克劳利感觉自己被那些话击垮了。又是另一个小小的行动的回响，违背了天堂的意愿，他的众多、众多、众多的小小过失之一。现在，在一切都太晚之前，最后一次放纵。“是的，”他低声说着，点了点头。“你说得对。”

Aziraphale looked painfully relieved. “Where shall we try? Somewhere nearby? The Ritz, maybe?” He hesitated, then offered, “How about yours?”  
亚齐拉费尔痛苦地松了口气。“我们去哪里试试？附近的地方？也许丽兹酒店？”他犹豫了一下，然后提议道：“你的地方怎么样？”

Crowley pushed his fingers through his hair. It didn’t feel like a night for getting plastered in front of strangers and there _was_ something nice about seeing Aziraphale making himself at home on the plush couch in his house, the restored ruins of their church visible through the window.  
克劳利用手指梳理着自己的头发。今晚并不适合在陌生人面前喝得酩酊大醉，而看到亚齐拉费尔在他的房子里舒适地坐在豪华沙发上，窗外还能看到他们教堂的修复遗迹，这种感觉真是美好。

“Mine, I think,” he said. “I’m not in the mood for food.”  
“我觉得是我的，”他说道。“我没胃口。”

Aziraphale’s face broke into a smile. “Oh, lovely! I can order in from that lovely little takeaway. They do those dumplings we like.”  
亚齐拉费尔的脸上露出了微笑。“哦，太好了！我可以从那家可爱的小外卖店订餐。他们有我们喜欢的那种饺子。”

Despite himself, Crowley couldn’t help smiling. “What did I just say?”  
不由自主，克劳利忍不住笑了起来。“我刚才说了什么？”

Aziraphale rounded his eyes. “You don’t _have_ to eat any.”  
亚齐拉费尔瞪大了眼睛。“你不必吃。”

Crowley shook his head with a crooked grin. “Of course I don’t,” he said, then nodded towards the road. “Come on. I’ve got the car.”  
克劳利歪着嘴角摇了摇头。“当然没有啦，”他说着，然后朝着路指了指。“走吧，车子在那边。”

“Oh.” Aziraphale made a face. “Goodie.”  
“哦。”亚齐拉费尔皱了皱眉头。“真好。”

The angel gave him a look. “You can get the Underground if you want.”  
天使瞥了他一眼。“如果你想的话，你可以搭地铁。”

Aziraphale shuddered. “Oh, no! Satan preserve me! But I swear that metal monstrosity of yours doesn’t like me.”  
亚齐拉费尔颤抖着说道：“哦，不！撒旦保佑我！但我发誓，你那个金属怪物不喜欢我。”

Crowley laughed for the first time since Gabriel had appeared as he headed towards the Bentley. “It’s called carsickness, Aziraphale. Nothing to do with the car. Everything to do with you.”  
克劳利自加百列出现以来第一次笑了起来，他朝着那辆宾利走去。“这叫晕车，阿齐拉费尔。跟车没关系，全都是因为你。”

“Hmph.” The demon grumbled sceptically, trotting after him. “Still think it doesn’t like me.”  
“哼。”恶魔怀疑地嘟囔着，跟在他后面小跑着。“还是觉得它不喜欢我。”

“Of course it doesn’t.” He couldn’t resist a playful nudge. “You’re an evil fiend after all.”  
“当然不会。”他忍不住调皮地推了一下。“毕竟你是个邪恶的恶魔。”

“Damn right I am!”  
“当然是的！”

Just outside a small village in Oxfordshire, a couple called Deirdre and Arthur Young were taking the baby they believed was theirs home from a charming maternity hospital full of very friendly, _very_ chatty nuns.  
在牛津郡的一个小村庄外，一对名叫迪尔德拉和亚瑟·杨的夫妇正将他们认为是自己的婴儿带回家，这个迷人的产科医院里住满了非常友好、健谈的修女。

The baby was not, in fact, theirs.  
这个婴儿实际上并不是他们的。

The Antichrist had been on earth for 24 hours.  
反基督已经在地球上待了24小时。

Meanwhile, in St. Dunstan’s Hill, an angel and a demon were making a game effort at drinking the contents of the angel’s wine loft.  
与此同时，在圣邓斯坦山，一位天使和一位恶魔正在努力地喝光天使酒窖里的酒。

The room they were in didn’t technically look like house at all. It was too round for one thing, with a high, pointed roof still painted with all kinds of allegorical images. Someone had carefully and deliberately painted a twirly moustache on the gilt-edged Lamb of God in the middle of the ceiling, a good twenty feet above the floor. It also had a monocle and was the jauntiest messianic image in all of London.  
他们所在的房间从技术上看根本不像是一间房子。首先，它太圆了，屋顶高高的，上面绘满了各种寓意深远的图案。有人在天花板中央的镀金上帝羔羊上精心而刻意地画了一把卷曲的小胡子，离地面有二十英尺高。它还戴着单片眼镜，是伦敦最时髦的救世主形象。

A few paintings hung on the walls and a handful of mismatched ornaments cluttered onto the window ledges. Plants guarded the high arches of the windows, beautiful and verdant and glowing with life. They even grew around the refrigerator, which stood near the door and was very definitely not plugged in, but that still managed to keep everything perfectly cold. It was also covered in drawings by small children of a variety of ages, many of them of ‘Mr. Crowley’, held in place by magnets from all kinds of exciting foreign places.  
墙上挂着几幅画，窗台上摆满了各种不搭调的装饰品。植物守护着高拱形的窗户，美丽而翠绿，散发着生机。它们甚至长在了冰箱周围，冰箱靠近门口，明显没有插电，但仍然能完美地保持冷藏。冰箱上还贴满了各个年龄段小孩子画的图画，其中许多都是关于“克劳利先生”的，用来固定的磁铁来自各种令人兴奋的外国地方。

And in the middle of the room, there was a ridiculously oversized couch, the only piece of furniture apart from the coffee table in front of it, which was currently piled with empty boxes from a Chinese restaurant and far too many half-drunk bottles of wine.  
房间中央摆放着一张荒谬地过大的沙发，除了放在前面的咖啡桌之外，这是唯一的家具。咖啡桌上堆满了来自一家中餐馆的空盒子，还有太多未喝完的酒瓶。

“S’not the same thing,” Crowley protested, wagging a finger. He was perched on the arm of the couch, his bare feet on the cushions, and swaying gently back and forth. “S’definitely not.”  
“不是一回事儿。”克劳利抗议着，摇着手指。他盘腿坐在沙发扶手上，光着脚放在靠垫上，轻轻地摇晃着。“绝对不是。”

Aziraphale made a face at him, from his position, reclined on the couch. His boots were tipped over on the floor, his jacket flung over the edge of the television and his feet – in their diamond-patterned socks – were propped comfortably between Crowley’s. “Is.” He took a swig from a bottle, then added, “You took miracles an’ gave them to someone else. Defying Heaven, that. They told you what to do and you…” He frowned in concentration, searching for the word. “Didn’t!”  
亚齐拉费尔从沙发上的卧姿位置朝他做了个鬼脸。他的靴子倒扣在地板上，夹克抛在电视边缘，他的脚——穿着菱形图案的袜子——舒适地搁在克劳利的脚上。“是。”他从瓶子里喝了一口，然后补充道，“你拿走了奇迹，给了别人。这是对天堂的挑战。他们告诉你该做什么，而你……”他皱起眉头，专注地寻找那个词。“没有！”

“I _did_!” Crowley insisted. “I did… just in a little bit different way than they asked. S’all doing good for people anyway!”  
“我做了！”克劳利坚称道。“我做了...只是以稍微不同的方式，不过对人们来说都是好事！”

“Not doing what they told you!” Aziraphale declared triumphantly. “Done it before. Can do it again.”  
“不听他们的话！”亚齐拉费尔得意地宣布道。“以前做过，可以再做一次。”

Crowley waved a hand. “No. _No_. S’totally different. Wossname… reinterpretatation of the text.”  
克劳利挥了挥手。“不，不，完全不同。那个什么来着……对文本的重新解释。”

Aziraphale prodded Crowley’s knee with his toe. “Can reinterpratate Revelations.”  
亚齐拉费尔用脚趾戳了克劳利的膝盖。“可以重新解读启示录。”

The angel hiccupped, then frowned. “What revelations?”  
天使打了个嗝，然后皱了皱眉头。“什么启示？”

Aziraphale pushed himself up on his elbows, squinting. “Dint you ever read your book? I mean…” He waved his bottle in the vague direction of the ceiling.  
亚齐拉费尔用手肘撑起身子，眯起眼睛。“你从来没读过你的书吗？我的意思是……”他随意地挥动着酒瓶，指向天花板的方向。

“Nothing ‘bout a revelation in my book,” Crowley said with a sniff.  
“在我看来，这根本不算是什么启示。”克劳利不屑地说道。

Aziraphale peered at him, puzzled. “Was. You remember? St. John? Skinny fellow. Looked like he’d been hit in the face with a hedgehog?”  
亚齐拉费尔疑惑地凝视着他。“是吗。你还记得吗？圣约翰？那个瘦瘦的家伙。看起来像是被刺猬打了一脸？”

Crowley blinked, his train of thought several carriages short of the platform. “Er…”  
克劳利眨了眨眼睛，他的思绪好像少了几节车厢。"嗯..."

“The one who went on about gates and wings and holy sheep and stuff?” Aziraphale added, sitting up. “End of the world stuff?”  
“那个说了一堆关于门和翅膀、神圣的羊之类的人？”亚齐拉费尔坐直了身子。“世界末日的事情？”

“Oh! Right! Yeah! Mushroom guy, right? Smelled like a dead goat?”  
哦！对！是的！蘑菇人，对吧？闻起来像死山羊？

“Yes!” Aziraphale beamed at him. “I mean, if we can’t rewrite mushroom guy’s nonsense, we’re pretty rubbish, aren’t we?”  
"是的！"亚齐拉费尔兴高采烈地对他说道。"我的意思是，如果我们不能改写那个蘑菇人的胡言乱语，那我们就太糟糕了，不是吗？"

The angel stared at him, then reached down and snatched the half-finished bottle from his hand, taking a hearty mouthful. He sat there, swaying gently, his brow all creased up in thought. “Can’t,” he finally said. “If it’s big divine plan stuff, can’t. Not allowed. They get cross if I do that.”  
天使盯着他看了一会儿，然后伸手从他手中抢过那个未喝完的瓶子，大口喝了一口。他坐在那里，轻轻晃动着，眉头紧皱思考着。“不行，”他最终说道。“如果是关乎伟大的神圣计划的事情，我不能这样做。不被允许的。他们会生气的。”

The demon groaned and threw himself back dramatically, flinging an arm over his eyes. “Satan’s sake, angel!” He was quiet for a moment, then made a thoughtful sound.  
恶魔闷哼一声，戏剧性地向后仰倒，一只手臂掩盖住了他的眼睛。“见鬼，天使！”他静默片刻，然后发出一声思考的声音。

“Mm?” Crowley inquired around the bottle of wine.  
“嗯？”克劳利围着酒瓶问道。

Aziraphale’s arm slipped away from his eyes and he stared at Crowley. “What if it _isn’t_ the divine plan?”  
亚齐拉费尔的手臂从眼前滑落，他盯着克劳利说道：“如果这不是神圣的计划呢？”

“Tis, though.” Crowley hiccupped again. “Gabriel came. Told me.” He made a face. “Don’t like him. Head up his bum.”  
“是的，没错。” 克劳利又打了个嗝。“加百列来了。告诉我的。” 他皱了皱眉。“不喜欢他。自以为是。”

Aziraphale giggled, but he had a determined look in his eyes as he pushed himself back upright, gripping the back of the couch for leverage. “No, no, no, my dear. Think about it!” He held up his other hand, folding a finger down at a time. “One: S’a baby from Hell, right?” Crowley nodded slowly. “Two: s’a demon whom delivered it.”  
亚齐拉费尔咯咯笑了起来，但他眼中闪烁着坚定的目光，他用手扶住沙发的靠背，重新坐直身子。“不，不，不，亲爱的。想一想！”他举起另一只手，一根接一根地弯曲手指。“一：这是来自地狱的孩子，对吧？”克劳利缓慢地点了点头。“二：是一个将其送来的恶魔。”

“Who,” Crowley corrected.  
“谁，”克劳利纠正道。

“Me, you idiot!” Aziraphale said indignantly. “Told you that already!”  
“我说过了，你这个白痴！”阿齐拉费尔愤怒地说道。

“Y’said ‘whom’,” Crowley stuck out his tongue. “You’re not a whom. You’re a who.”  
“你说了‘whom’，”克劳利伸出舌头。“你不是‘whom’，你是‘who’。”

Aziraphale waved his hand dismissively. “Not important.” His brow furrowed. “What was I saying?”  
亚齐拉费尔不以为意地挥了挥手。“不重要。”他皱起了眉头。“我刚才在说什么来着？”

“You. Baby.” 你。宝贝。

“Oh! Right! Yes!” He nodded enthusiastically. “Me. Baby. Number… er…” He peered at his hand. “Three? Yes, three! Arranged by demons!”  
"哦！对！是的！"他热情地点头。“我。宝贝。数字……嗯……”他凝视着自己的手。“三？是的，三！被恶魔安排的！”

“So?” Crowley peered gloomily into his now-empty bottle. He swung his legs down from the couch and in a tremendous feat of agility, managed to stagger over the 12-inch space between himself and the coffee table to grab another bottle.  
“那又怎样？”克劳利郁郁地盯着他现在空空如也的瓶子。他从沙发上摆下双腿，以惊人的灵活度，成功地蹒跚着穿过他与咖啡桌之间的12英寸空间，拿起了另一瓶酒。

“So? It means is not divine plan. S’diabolical is what it is.”  
那又怎样？这意味着并非神的计划。就是邪恶的，就是这样。

Crowley plopped himself back down on the arm of the couch, eyes wide and wondering. “You think?”  
克劳利又一次重重地坐回沙发扶手上，眼睛睁得大大的，满怀疑惑。“你觉得呢？”

“Stands to reason,” Aziraphale said, leaning off the couch to pick up the last dumpling. “S’a diabolical plan and you know what you do with them.”  
“理所当然嘛，”亚齐拉费尔说着，从沙发上探身起来拿起最后一个饺子。“这是个邪恶的计划，你知道该怎么对付它们。”

“Thwart!” Crowley crowed, toasting with a bottle that was a little fuller than he realised. Wine splattered everywhere. “Bollocks!” He transferred the bottle to his empty hand, shaking the wine off his fingers, then glared at the bottle. “Think I need to be a bit more sober for this.”  
“阻止！”克劳利得意地喊道，举起一瓶比他意识到的要满一些的酒。酒溅得到处都是。“该死！”他把酒瓶转移到空手上，摇掉手指上的酒，然后瞪着酒瓶。“我想我需要再清醒一些。”

“Boring!” Aziraphale groaned, licking his own fingers clean.  
“无聊！”阿齐拉费尔抱怨道，舔了舔自己的手指干净。

“Not boring!” Crowley sat up a little straighter. “Big thoughts need big brain.”  
“一点也不无聊！”克劳利挺直了一点身子。“大思想需要大脑。”

“As if getting sober’ll help you there.”  
好像戒酒会对你有所帮助似的。

“Oi!” Crowley gave him a kick on the shin. “You too?”  
“喂！”克劳利踢了他一脚。 “你也是？”

The demon groaned again, shoving himself up against the cushions. “Oh, all _right_. If I must.”  
恶魔又一次呻吟着，将自己推到靠垫上。“哦，好吧。如果我必须这样。”

There was a peculiar slurping sound like the dregs of a milkshake being sucked through a straw, and the slosh of a dozen empty wine bottles refilling from the bottom up. Both demon and angel winced and Crowley slid down off the arm of the couch, landing by Aziraphale’s feet.  
有一种奇怪的咕噜声，就像用吸管吸干奶昔底部的残渣，还有十几个空酒瓶从底部重新注满的咕咚声。恶魔和天使都皱了皱眉，克劳利从沙发扶手上滑下来，落在亚齐拉费尔的脚边。

“Do you really think it counts as a demonic plan?” he asked.  
他问道：“你真的认为这算是一个恶魔计划吗？”

“Undoubtably,” Aziraphale nodded. “I mean, it’s all in our hands. Surely that makes it your angelic duty to try and stop it? Thwarting our wiles, as they say?” He gave the angel an encouraging smile. “Heaven couldn’t get annoyed with you for trying to stop us, could they? I mean, it’s literally your job!”  
“毫无疑问，”亚齐拉费尔点头道。“我的意思是，这完全掌握在我们手中。这肯定是你作为天使的职责，试图阻止它吧？就像他们说的，挫败我们的诡计。”他鼓励地笑了笑。“天堂不会因为你试图阻止我们而生气，对吧？我的意思是，这可是你的工作！”

Crowley’s face was a picture of anxious thought, a deep line cutting between his brows. “Hm.”  
克劳利的脸上写满了焦虑的思绪，一道深深的皱纹划过他的眉间。“嗯。”

Aziraphale leaned forward, gently rubbing the worry line away with his thumb. “You’ll hurt yourself if you keep running your poor wits in circles.”  
亚齐拉费尔向前倾身，用拇指轻轻地摩擦着那道忧虑的皱纹。“如果你继续困扰自己，只会伤害到自己。”

Crowley swatted his hand away with a rueful smile. “You know that’s not how my brain works.” He scratched at his temple. “You said you had a plan?”  
克劳利带着一丝苦笑，挥手拒绝了他的建议。“你知道我的思维方式不是这样的。”他挠了挠太阳穴。“你说你有个计划？”

Aziraphale’s eyes lit up hopefully. “A tentative one,” he admitted. “You see, I’m to be there to corrupt the child. Lord knows why they think I can do that.”  
亚齐拉费尔的眼睛充满了希望的光芒。“是一个试探性的计划，”他承认道。“你知道，我要去腐化那个孩子。天知道他们为什么认为我能做到。”

“Can’t _begin_ to imagine,” Crowley murmured dryly.  
克劳利干巴巴地嘀咕道：“无法想象。”

Aziraphale narrowed his eyes in mock outrage. “Was that necessary, my dear?”  
亚齐拉费尔嘴角微微一扬，装作愤怒的样子眯起了眼睛。“亲爱的，这真的有必要吗？”

“Saw an opening,” Crowley said with a twitch of a smile. “Couldn’t help myself.”  
“看到机会了。”克劳利微微一笑说道，“忍不住动了手脚。”

Aziraphale’s lips curved in a smug smile. “I do so like it when you’re naughty.”  He waved his hands. “But I’m getting off-course! So yes. I’m to… ingratiate myself to the family and ensure that the boy is… made ready for his role in the future, in all things evil and awful. It would be a shame if someone were to… offer an alternative perspective. Perhaps teach him about virtue and goodness and all that nonsense.”  
亚齐拉费尔得意地笑了起来。“我喜欢你调皮的样子。”他挥了挥手。“但是我离题了！所以是的。我要……讨好这个家庭，并确保这个男孩为他在未来的邪恶和可怕的角色做好准备。如果有人提供一个不同的观点，那将是一种遗憾。也许教他关于美德和善良以及所有那些废话。”

“But would it work?” “但这能行吗？”

The demon nodded. “He’s human, for now at least. That’s why he needs to be surrounded by the… ah… right influences: to ensure that he’s moulded into the right shape when the time comes.”  
恶魔点了点头。“他现在是人类，至少暂时是。这就是为什么他需要被……嗯……正确的影响所包围：以确保在时机成熟时他能被塑造成正确的形态。”

“Human…” Crowley echoed thoughtfully. “So if he has good and bad influences, we might get a… zero-sum result?”  
“人类…” 克劳利沉思地回应道。“所以如果他受到正面和负面的影响，我们可能会得到一个… 零和结果？”

“Yes!” Aziraphale clapped his hands delightedly. “Precisely that! Just as we’ve been doing all this time, only with far greater stakes.”  
“是的！”亚齐拉费尔高兴地拍了拍手。“就是这样！就像我们一直在做的那样，只是现在的赌注更大了。”

Crowley leaned back against the arm of the chair, tilting his head back to gaze up at the ceiling. “Always did like teaching the humans,” he murmured. “It’s only one of them as well, someone who just needs a little bit of a nudge in the right direction.” He was silent for a few minutes, oblivious to the intensely worried and hopeful look on the demon’s face. When he finally looked back at Aziraphale, Crowley looked much calmer.  “Can’t hurt to try, can it?”  
克劳利靠在椅子扶手上，仰头凝视着天花板。“我一直喜欢教导人类，”他低声说道。“而且只是其中一个人，只需要在正确的方向上稍微推一下。”他静默了几分钟，完全没有注意到恶魔脸上那种极度担忧和希望的表情。当他最终重新看向亚齐拉费尔时，克劳利看起来平静多了。“试一试又何妨呢？”

“What’s the worst that can happen?” Aziraphale agreed eagerly. “I mean, we’re _both_ doing our jobs. They can’t really say anything.” He laughed suddenly. “We’ll be Godfathers, of a sort. Taking care of the little mite’s religious upbringing.”  
“最糟糕的情况是什么？”亚齐拉费尔兴奋地表示同意。“我的意思是，我们都在做我们的工作。他们不会真的说什么。”他突然笑了起来。“我们将成为某种意义上的教父，照顾这个小家伙的宗教教育。”

“Godfathers…” Crowley’s face lit in a beatific smile. “Yeah. I like the sound of that.”  
“教父们……” 克劳利的脸上露出了一个神圣的微笑。“是的。我喜欢这个听起来。”

“You’re in then?” "你确定要加入吗？"

Crowley offered his hand and the demon grasped it at once. “I’m in.”  
克劳利伸出手，恶魔立刻握住了它。“我同意。”

### Chapter Text 章节正文

“You have to meet her,” Harriet said. She was doing that thing her mom did when she wanted to get her own way, smiling through her teeth, and God, he had enough to do without her turning into a bitch like his mother-in-law. “She’s going to be raising _our_ son. You’ve done jackshit else for him. At least you can say you helped pick his Nanny.”  
“你必须见她。”哈丽特说道。她正在做她妈妈想要按照自己的方式行事时常做的那种事情，咧嘴笑着，天啊，他已经忙得够呛了，不想看到她变成像他的婆婆那样的恶毒女人。“她将会抚养我们的儿子。你对他几乎没做过什么。至少你可以说你帮忙挑选了他的保姆。”

Tad glanced at his secretary, who stared at her diary. “You have five minutes before the call from Berlin, sir.”  
塔德瞥了一眼他的秘书，她正盯着她的日记本。“先生，距离来自柏林的电话还有五分钟。”

“Five minutes.” He got up. “Okay, honey. Where is this Nanny?”  
"五分钟。”他起身。“好的，亲爱的。这位保姆在哪里？”

She was sitting in the room that the house-plan called a drawing room. Tad had never figured out why. Maybe that was where the people sat to do their drawings in the old days. It looked kind of like a fancy living room and they’d even kept the old furniture in it because it made a hell of an impression on visitors.  
她坐在房子平面图上称为客厅的房间里。Tad从来没有弄明白为什么。也许那是过去人们用来画图的地方。它看起来有点像一个豪华的起居室，他们甚至保留了旧家具，因为这给访客留下了深刻的印象。

“Introduce us, hon.” 介绍一下我们，亲爱的。

“Tad, this is Miss Ashtoreth.” Harriet said. “Miss Ashtoreth, my husband, Thaddeus.”  
“塔德，这位是阿什托雷丝小姐。” 哈丽特说道。“阿什托雷丝小姐，这位是我的丈夫，塔德。”

The woman rose from the couch, turning to him with a smile.  
女人从沙发上站起来，转身对着他微笑着。

She looked… like a British nanny was meant to look, kind of. Okay, yeah, he was going off of Mary Poppins and the Sound of Music and his mom’s old favourite movies, but she had the frilly-necked shirt, the suit and a string of pearls around her neck. She wasn’t exactly young, but she didn’t look all that old either, even though she had curly white-blonde hair.  
她看起来……有点像英国保姆的样子。好吧，是的，他参考了《玛丽·波普底斯》和《音乐之声》，还有他妈妈最喜欢的老电影，但她有那种褶边领衬衫、西装和一串珍珠项链。她并不年轻，但也不显得很老，尽管她有一头卷曲的白金色头发。

Only her lipstick was shiny and red, her suit so fitted he could see what a… big girl she was, and when he took her hand to shake it, she gave his fingers a slow, firm squeeze. “Mr. Ambassador, I believe,” she said in a voice that should have been illegal anywhere but a specific kind of expensive phone line. “Such a pleasure, I’m sure.”  
只有她的口红是闪亮的红色，她的西装如此合身，他能看出她是个...大个子，当他握住她的手时，她用缓慢而有力的力度握了一下他的手指。“大使先生，我相信。”她用一种声音说道，这种声音在除了某种特定昂贵的电话线之外，应该是非法的。“非常高兴，我敢肯定。”

“Uh. Hi.” He glanced sidelong at Harriet, but she looked like she hadn’t noticed. “A pleasure to meet you too, Miss Ashtoreth. Harriet tells me you’re going to be our son’s Nanny.”  
“嗯，嗨。”他斜眼看了哈丽特一眼，但她似乎没有注意到。“很高兴见到您，阿什托雷斯小姐。哈丽特告诉我您将成为我们儿子的保姆。”

The Nanny smiled, ducking her chin. “Only,” she said, biting her lower lip, “if you’ll have me.”🔄  ❓

Tad’s throat went dry. She wasn’t a good-looking woman, but Jesus Christ! Her eyes flicked up and met his and she winked. He couldn’t stop staring at her. No one who looked like a little school teacher was meant to act like _that_.  
塔德的喉咙变得干燥起来。她并不是一个漂亮的女人，但天哪！她的目光扫过来与他对视，然后她眨了眨眼。他无法停止盯着她看。像个小学教师一样的人不应该有那种行为。

“Uh. Sure. Yeah.” Her thumb brushed the back of his palm, reminding him he was still holding her hand. He yanked his fingers free, taking a quick step back. Oh, God, it was probably a bad idea to let her in the house, but if it got Harriet off his back, that had to be a good thing, right? “I’m – uh – I’m sure you’ll fit right in here, hon– uh – ma’am.”  
“嗯，好的，是的。”她的拇指轻轻划过他手背，提醒他他仍然握着她的手。他猛地抽回手指，快步后退。哦，天啊，让她进屋可能是个坏主意，但如果能让哈里特不再纠缠，那肯定是件好事，对吧？“我，嗯，我相信你会在这里适应得很好，亲爱的，嗯，女士。”

She smiled. “Oh, that’s wonderful, my dear.” She reached out and squeezed his wrist, her little finger stroking intimately along his thumb. “I’m sure we’ll be the very best of friends.”  
她微笑着说：“哦，太好了，亲爱的。”她伸出手，握住他的手腕，小指亲昵地沿着他的拇指轻抚着。“我相信我们会成为最好的朋友。”

“God, he is such a bastard sometimes!”  
天啊，他有时候真是个混蛋！

Miss Ashtoreth nodded sympathetically. “Men often are,” she agreed as she poured Harriet a cup of coffee. “Would you like sugar, my dear?”  
阿什托雷丝小姐同情地点了点头。“男人们经常如此，”她同意地说道，一边给哈丽特倒了一杯咖啡。“亲爱的，你要加糖吗？”

Harriet nodded gratefully.  
哈丽特感激地点了点头。

Ever since Miss Ashtoreth moved in, she’d made Harriet’s life a hell of a lot easier. Warlock was out from under her feet for the first time in five years and his Nanny acted like it was her job to look after the whole family. She was so _nice_ to all of them, even Tad.  
自从Ashtoreth小姐搬进来，哈丽特的生活变得轻松了许多。五年来，Warlock第一次不再让她困扰，而他的保姆则像是她的工作就是照顾整个家庭。她对他们每个人都很友善，甚至对Tad也是如此。

“So,” Miss Ashtoreth said, once she’d put Warlock’s cereal in front of him. He always ate it at the table, without complaining or throwing it on the floor or yelling about his toys, and in Harriet’s eyes that was a god-damned miracle. “What has he been up to now?”  
“那么，”阿什托雷斯小姐说道，她把沃洛克的早餐放在他面前。他总是坐在桌子旁边吃，从不抱怨、扔东西或者为他的玩具大喊大叫，对哈丽特来说，这简直是个奇迹。“他最近又搞什么鬼？”

It was probably totally inappropriate, but breakfast with the Nanny was the only time there were Secret Service people – all working for her husband – around. It’s not like she had many friends in the city either and God knew all their phonecalls were recorded.  
这可能完全不合适，但与保姆一起吃早餐是唯一有特勤人员在场的时候，他们都是为她丈夫工作的。她在这个城市也没有很多朋友，上帝知道他们所有的电话都被记录下来了。

“I think he’s…” She glanced at Warlock to make sure he wasn’t listening. “He’s acting like there’s someone else.”  
“我觉得他…” 她瞥了一眼Warlock，确保他没有在听。“他的行为好像有另外一个人。”

“Oh _no_.” Miss Ashtoreth sounded shocked. “Do you really think so, my dear?”  
“哦不。”阿什托雷斯小姐听起来很震惊。“亲爱的，你真的这么认为吗？”

Did she? She wasn’t sure. Yeah, she’d caught him in the bathroom with his hand down his pants, staring at his phone, but he was a guy and what guy didn’t look at porn? But she’d never see Tad go red in the face about it before.  
她这样做了吗？她不确定。是的，她在浴室里看到他手伸进裤子里，盯着手机看，但他是个男人，有哪个男人不看色情片呢？但她从未见过塔德因此而脸红过。

He’d shut down his phone and shoved it away, which made her more suspicious the longer she thought about it, especially when it was his work-issued phone and not his private one. He wouldn’t have been dumb enough to look at porn on that one, which meant whoever he was seeing was someone he’d met in a professional capacity.  
他关掉了手机并把它推开，这让她越想越觉得可疑，尤其是当她想到那是他的工作手机而不是私人手机时。他不会傻到在工作手机上看色情片，这意味着他见到的那个人是他在职业场合遇到的。

“You should ask him,” Miss Ashtoreth suggested, smiling kindly. “Honesty is always the best policy, dear. You wouldn’t want to let the suspicion fester if there is nothing to worry about.”  
“你应该问他。”阿什托雷斯小姐友善地建议道，微笑着。“诚实始终是最好的策略，亲爱的。如果没有什么可担心的，你不会想让怀疑滋生。”

“You think so?” "你这么认为吗？"

Miss Ashtoreth nodded. “If there’s nothing to worry about, then why get yourself all worked up? Better to be sure.” She took a delicate sip of her tea. She always used a cup and saucer and had her little finger curled up. English ladies were all so refined, Harriet thought enviously. God knew she’d tried, but she always felt like a hick around the woman, no matter how sweet she was. Miss Ashtoreth smiled at her. “Do you think you shall?”  
阿什托雷丝小姐点了点头。“如果没有什么可担心的，那你为什么要让自己紧张起来呢？最好还是确定一下。”她小口品尝了一口茶。她总是使用茶杯和茶碟，小指翘起。哈丽特羡慕地想，英国女士们都是如此优雅。天知道她尽力了，但无论她多么友善，她总觉得自己像个乡巴佬。阿什托雷丝小姐对她微笑。“你认为你会吗？”

“Shall?” “应该吗？”

“Talk to your husband?” 和你丈夫交谈？

Harriet frowned, turning her cup between her hands. “I don’t know. I don’t want to make a big deal if nothing is going on.”  
哈丽特皱了皱眉头，双手握着杯子转动着。“我不知道。如果没有什么事情发生，我不想大惊小怪。”

“I’m sure there’s nothing,” Miss Ashtoreth said soothingly. “After all, he’s a very busy man. When would he have the time?” She laughed. “Oh, imagine if he had to fit that into his diary. Tuesday, two pm: philandering.” She shook her head, laughing again. “What a thought, my dear.”  
“我敢肯定没有什么事情，”阿什托雷丝小姐安抚地说道。“毕竟，他是个非常忙碌的人。他什么时候有时间呢？”她笑了起来。“哦，想象一下，如果他要把这件事安排进他的日程表里。星期二下午两点：调情。”她摇了摇头，再次笑了起来。“真是个有趣的想法，亲爱的。”

What a thought… 真是个有趣的想法…

Harriet tried not to think about it, but it was like an itch she couldn’t stop scratching. She tried to sneak a look at his phone when he was in the bathroom, she asked his assistants about his any openings in his diary, and after waking up for the fourth time to see him sitting in the armchair in their room, grunting and pumping into his hand, his shoulder and head haloed by the light from his cell, she had had enough.  
哈丽特尽量不去想这件事，但它就像一种无法停止的痒感。她试图在他上洗手间的时候偷看他的手机，她询问他的助手关于他日程表上的任何空闲时间，而在第四次醒来时看到他坐在他们房间的扶手椅上，用手发出嘶嘶声并不断抽动，他的肩膀和头部被手机的光环绕着，她已经受够了。

She crept across the room, until she was almost close enough to see. “What the hell’s going on, Tad?” she snapped.  
她悄悄地穿过房间，直到几乎能看清楚。"塔德，到底发生了什么事？"她厉声问道。

He didn’t stop and that made it worse. “Not now, hon.”  
他没有停下来，这让情况变得更糟。“现在不行，亲爱的。”

“Now!” She grabbed his shoulder, leaning over to see the screen. She got a glimpse of a pair of huge tits in a tight, wet cream blouse that was open down to the bright-red bra and a tattoo of a snake coiling down, the snake’s head nosing right between them, before he slammed his cell down on the arm of the chair beside him.  
“现在！”她抓住他的肩膀，俯身看屏幕。她瞥见了一对穿着紧身、湿润的奶油色衬衫的巨大胸部，衬衫敞开到亮红色的胸罩和一条蛇的纹身，蛇的头正好夹在它们之间，然后他狠狠地把手机砸在椅子扶手上。

“What the hell’s wrong with you?” He sat up angrily. “Don’t I get any privacy?”  
“你到底怎么了？”他生气地坐了起来。“我就不能有点隐私吗？”

“Privacy? You’re in our god-damned bedroom! I live here too!” She snatched for his cell. “Who the hell is that?”  
“隐私？你就在我们这该死的卧室里！我也住在这里！”她伸手抢他的手机。“到底是谁？”

“That’s– it– that–” He scrambled up, shoving himself back in his pants. He never stammered like that or got flustered like that over porn. They’d watched enough of the crap together. “That’s not your concern.”  
“那个...那个...” 他匆忙站起来，把裤子塞回去。他从来没有像那样结结巴巴或因为色情而慌乱。他们一起看过足够多的垃圾片了。“那不关你的事。”

“Not my concern when you’re getting off on some official’s staff?”  
“当你对某个官员的员工感兴趣时，与我无关。”

“What the hell are you on about?” There was enough of a tell in his voice to know she’d hit the mark. “The staff? Are you serious?”  
你到底在说什么？他的语气中透露出足够的线索，让她知道她说中了要害。“员工？你是认真的吗？”

“Screw you!” she snarled and pointed at the door. “Get the hell out and take your big-titted slut wherever you like. You’re not sleeping with me.”  
“滚开！”她咆哮着指着门。“滚出去，带着你那个胸大无脑的荡妇去哪都行。你别想跟我上床。”

“Oh, _now_ you have an excuse for being frigid?”  
哦，现在你有借口冷淡了吗？

“_Frigid_?” “寒冷？”

It got worse from there.  
从那时起情况变得更糟。

“I shouldn’t have said anything,” she said unhappily to Miss Ashtoreth the next morning. “I didn’t want to believe he had some little slut, especially not one with huge tits and a tattoo.”  
第二天早上，她不开心地对阿什托雷丝小姐说：“我不应该说什么的。我不想相信他有个小荡妇，尤其是一个有巨大胸部和纹身的。”

The Nanny gently patted her hand. “Better you know, my dear,” she consoled her, squeezing her fingers. “You know your own worth, that’s what matters.” She glanced about and leaned closer. “Have you considered a little shopping trip? Retail therapy perhaps?” She smiled encouragingly. “It would take your mind off all this nonsense, wouldn’t it?”  
保姆轻轻拍了拍她的手。“亲爱的，你最好知道。”她安慰她，握紧了她的手指。“你知道自己的价值，这才是最重要的。”她环顾四周，凑近了一些。“你考虑过去逛逛街吗？也许购物疗法会有帮助。”她鼓励地微笑着。“这样可以让你把注意力从这些废话上转移出来，不是吗？”

“We have to be pretty strict about our expenses,” Harriet said, shaking her head. Yeah, the salary had been a major drop from her CEO salary, but she’d thought that being an Ambassador’s wife would be worth it. “We’re working on the taxpayer’s dime, after all.”  
“我们对开支必须非常严格，”哈丽特摇了摇头说道。是的，她的薪水与她担任首席执行官时相比大幅下降，但她曾以为成为大使的妻子会是值得的。“毕竟我们是用纳税人的钱在工作。”

To her surprise, Miss Ashtoreth tutted. “And so you’ll let everyone else have all the fun, while you’re left with nothing? It’s only a little shopping spree. With all those idiots burning through money on the stock-exchange, why would they mind you buying a nice pair of shoes?” She nodded towards the door. “Go on. Indulge yourself. _He_ certainly seems to be.”  
让她惊讶的是，阿什托雷斯小姐咂了咂嘴。“所以你会让其他人尽情享乐，而你却一无所获吗？这只是一个小小的购物狂欢。那些在股市上挥霍金钱的白痴们，他们会在意你买一双漂亮的鞋吗？”她朝门口点了点头。“去吧。尽情享受吧。他显然也在这么做。”

Somehow, Miss Ashtoreth always knew the right things to say to make her feel better.  
不知怎么的，阿什托雷丝小姐总是知道该说些什么来让她感觉好些。

“Yeah,” she said, then smiled at the thought. God, it had been so long since she’d had some fun in the stores and London had so many. “I think I’ll do that.”  
“是的，”她说着，然后对这个想法微笑了一下。天啊，她已经很久没有在商店里玩得开心了，而伦敦有那么多好玩的地方。“我想我会这么做。”

“Good,” Miss Ashtoreth said, smiling like an angel. “That’s _lovely_.”  
“很好，”阿什托雷斯小姐笑着说道，笑容如天使般灿烂。“太美了。”

Warlock snuck around the back of one of the big bushes, keeping a look out. Nanny was sitting on a folding chair with a book, but she was smiling. They had a bet. Nanny said he couldn’t steal an apple from the apple tree at the end of the garden. He told her he could.  
术士悄悄绕到了一个大灌木丛的后面，保持警惕。奶奶坐在折叠椅上看书，但她在微笑。他们打了个赌。奶奶说他不能从花园尽头的苹果树上偷一个苹果。他告诉她他能做到。

“Very well, my dear,” she had said, stroking his hair. “I’ll wait here and once you’ve stolen it, you can bring it to me and we’ll make it into a pie.”  
“非常好，亲爱的，”她轻抚着他的头发说道。“我会在这里等着，一旦你偷到了它，你就可以把它带给我，我们会把它做成一个馅饼。”

“A real pie? Just for us?” He liked eating with Nanny. She always found the best food and she never yelled at him when he didn’t like something. She just found something better instead.  
“真的有馅饼？就给我们吃？”他喜欢和奶奶一起吃饭。她总是能找到最好的食物，而且当他不喜欢某样东西时，她从不对他大喊大叫，而是会找到更好的替代品。

She smiled and nodded. “Of course, my dear.”  
她微笑着点了点头。“当然，亲爱的。”

He peeked out from behind another bush, watching out for his dad’s Secret Service guys. They were big and scary with guns and they didn’t like him walking anywhere without holding Nanny’s hand which was – he giggled – bullshit. He liked that word. He’d heard dad using it and it made mom mad when he used it, but Nanny just laughed and told him he had a good … vo-cab-i-l-ary. She taught him lots of words. His favourite one made mom go and scream at dad.  
他从另一棵灌木丛后面偷偷探出头来，小心翼翼地留意着他爸爸的特勤人员。他们个个高大威猛，手持枪支，不喜欢他不牵着保姆的手走动，这真是胡扯。他喜欢这个词。他听到爸爸用过它，每次他用这个词时妈妈都会生气，但保姆只会笑着告诉他他有一个很好的……词汇量。她教了他很多词。他最喜欢的那个词会让妈妈冲去对爸爸大吼。

One time, he got Nanny into trouble when they were having a water fight in the yard, pretending to fight all of the angels of Heaven. Nanny was all wet and had taken her jacket off to chase Warlock, trying to catch him in it. Dad got real mad and came stomping to his window, yelling and using all the words mom didn’t like. Nanny told Warlock to hold her jacket and went to talk to him at the window. Warlock didn’t know what Nanny said, but when she came back, dad was all red-faced and quiet.  
有一次，他们在院子里玩水战时，他让保姆陷入了麻烦，假装与天堂的所有天使战斗。保姆全身湿透，脱下外套追赶着Warlock，试图用外套抓住他。爸爸非常生气，跺着脚走到窗前，大声喊叫，使用了妈妈不喜欢的词语。保姆让Warlock拿着她的外套，走到窗前与爸爸交谈。Warlock不知道保姆说了什么，但当她回来时，爸爸满脸通红，一言不发。

“Is dad mad at you?” he asked when she put him to bed that night.  
当她晚上哄他入睡时，他问道：“爸爸生你的气了吗？”

“Oh no, my darling boy,” she told him, smiling. “He only wanted to tell me my blouse was unbuttoned. He was worried I would catch a cold.”  
“哦不，我亲爱的孩子，”她微笑着告诉他。“他只是想告诉我衬衫没扣好。他担心我会着凉。”

Warlock didn’t think his dad even noticed anything like that. Dad sounded mad, but Nanny stopped him being mad. That was all that mattered. She was real good at it too.  
术士觉得他爸爸甚至没有注意到这样的事情。爸爸听起来很生气，但保姆阻止了他发火。这就是最重要的。她在这方面真的很擅长。

No one ever got mad around Nanny, but now, he was on his own and he had to sneak without anyone catching him.  
没有人在奶奶身边发过脾气，但现在，他独自一人，必须偷偷摸摸地行动，不让任何人发现他。

When he was sure no one could see him, he ran as fast as he could towards the apple tree. It was big and tall and the apples were all red and shiny. There were some on the grass, but the worms would be eating them and worms in pie sounded gross. The tree wasn’t so high and there were branches low enough for him to grab, so he started to climb.  
当他确定没有人能看到他时，他尽可能快地朝着苹果树跑去。那棵树又大又高，苹果都是红彤彤、闪闪发亮的。草地上有一些苹果，但是蠕虫会吃掉它们，而且苹果馅饼里有蠕虫听起来很恶心。树并不是很高，有一些低矮的树枝可以供他抓住，所以他开始爬上去。

By the time he was high enough to reach the apples, it looked a long way down. He reached out, stretching as far as he could, but he slipped and one of the branches made a snapping noise.  
当他爬得足够高以够到苹果时，往下看去似乎很远。他伸出手，尽可能地伸展，但是他滑了一下，一根树枝发出了断裂的声音。

Warlock clung onto the trunk, yelping.  
术士紧紧抓住树干，尖叫着。

“Warlock!” “术士！”

“Mr. Francis!” Warlock wailed. “Help! I’m stuck!”  
“弗朗西斯先生！”巫师哭喊道。“救命！我被困住了！”

Mr. Francis laughed. “It’s all right,” he said. “Hold on. I’ll come up and get ye.”  
弗朗西斯先生笑了笑。“没关系，”他说。“等一下，我上来接你。”

Warlock nodded, squeezing his eyes shut. Mr. Francis climbed up behind him and wrapped his arm around Warlock’s middle.  
术士点了点头，紧闭双眼。弗朗西斯先生爬上他的身后，将手臂搂在术士的腰间。

“All right, wee man,” he said in his funny Scottish voice. “Ye can let go now. I have a hold of ye.”  
“好了，小家伙，”他用他那有趣的苏格兰口音说道。“你可以松手了。我抓住你了。”

Warlock clung onto his arm all the way down from the tree and as soon as they were on the ground, he spun around and hugged Mr. Francis, burying his face in the gardener’s belly. “S’too high,” he whispered, clinging onto Mr. Francis’s overalls.  
从树上一路下来，Warlock紧紧抓住他的胳膊，一落地就转过身来，紧紧拥抱住弗朗西斯先生，把脸埋在园丁的肚子里。“太高了，”他低声说着，紧紧抓住弗朗西斯先生的工装裤。

“Aye, a wee bit.” Mr. Francis knelt down and wrapped him up in the best hug. Mr. Francis always gave the best hugs and stopped everything being scary. “What were ye doing up there anyway?”  
“是的，一点点。”弗朗西斯先生跪下来，给他一个最温暖的拥抱。弗朗西斯先生总是给人最温暖的拥抱，让一切恐怖都消失了。“你到底在那上面做什么？”

Warlock sniffed hard and leaned back to look at him. His hair was in a ponytail today and his beard looked all fuzzy. He always looked like the school gardener from The Simpsons with a lot more hair. “I wanted to get an apple for Nanny,” he admitted. “She bet I could steal one off the tree.”  
术士用力嗅了嗅，向后仰头看着他。他今天把头发扎成了马尾，胡子看起来也有些蓬乱。他总是看起来像《辛普森一家》里的学校园丁，只是头发更多而已。“我想给奶奶弄个苹果，”他承认道。“她打赌说我能从树上偷一个。”

“An apple?” Mr. Francis looked like he was trying not to laugh. “Aye, right enough. Nanny likes an apple or two.” He wiped Warlock’s cheeks with his thumbs. “Would ye like me to help?”  
“一个苹果？”弗朗西斯先生看起来像是在努力不笑。“嗯，确实。奶妈喜欢吃一两个苹果。”他用拇指擦拭着沃洛克的脸颊。“你想让我帮忙吗？”

“Nanny said _I_ have to steal it,” he protested.  
“保姆说我必须偷它，”他抗议道。

Mr. Francis nodded. “Nanny says a lot of silly things, wee man.” He took Warlock’s hands in his. “Ye can have some apples and I’m sure Nanny’ll be happy enough. Ye don’t need to steal anything. Ye can ask nicely and people can help ye.”  
弗朗西斯先生点了点头。“保姆说了很多傻话，小家伙。”他握住了沃洛克的手。“你可以吃一些苹果，我相信保姆会很高兴。你不需要偷东西，你可以礼貌地请求别人的帮助。”

Warlock thought about it and sniffed, then nodded. “Please can you help me, Mr. Francis?”  
术士思考了一下，嗅了嗅，然后点了点头。“请问你能帮帮我吗，弗朗西斯先生？”

Mr. Francis gave him a big smile. “Of course I can, wee man.” He got back up and hoisted Warlock up onto his shoulders. “Ye should be able to reach from there.”  
弗朗西斯先生给了他一个灿烂的微笑。“当然可以，小家伙。”他重新站起来，把沃洛克抱到肩膀上。“从那里你应该能够够到。”

Warlock stretched up as high as he could and gave a happy shout when he grabbed one of the apples. “I got one!”  
术士尽力伸展身体，当他抓住一个苹果时，他高兴地大喊道：“我抓到了一个！”

“Do ye want to get some more?”  
你们想再来点吗？

Warlock bounced excitedly on his shoulders. “Yes!” He paused, then leaned down to look at Mr. Francis. “Please can I have some more, Mr. Francis?”  
术士兴奋地在他的肩膀上跳来跳去。“是的！”他停了下来，然后弯下腰看着弗朗西斯先生。“弗朗西斯先生，我可以再要一些吗？”

Mr. Francis laughed. “As many as ye like, wee man.”  
弗朗西斯先生笑了起来。“你想要多少，小伙子。”

Mr. Francis helped him pick enough apples to fill a whole basket. He even gave Warlock some milk and a secret chocolate chip cookie as well and told him the story of how the ladybug got her spots, before he sent Warlock back to Nanny.  
弗朗西斯先生帮他摘了足够多的苹果，装满了一个篮子。他甚至给了沃洛克一些牛奶和一块秘密的巧克力曲奇，并告诉他瓢虫是如何得到斑点的故事，然后才把沃洛克送回保姆那里。

“My word!” Nanny said as he dragged the basket back to her. “You’ve been very busy.”  
“我的天！”保姆说着，把篮子拖回到她身边。“你真是忙得不可开交。”

Warlock nodded happily. “I got the best ones for you.”  
术士开心地点了点头。“我给你找到了最好的。”

She leaned down off her seat and picked up the basket. “I see that.” She smiled, big and soft. “I’m very proud of you.”  
她弯下腰，从座位上拿起篮子。“我看到了。”她微笑着，温柔而开心地说道：“我为你感到非常骄傲。”

Warlock wriggled happily. “Can we make pie now?”  
术士高兴地扭动着身体。“我们现在可以做馅饼吗？”

Nanny laughed and got to her feet. “And pudding and tart,” she said, taking the basket in one hand and holding out her other hand to him. Warlock took it at once. It was always the best day when Nanny made food.  
保姆笑了起来，站了起来。“还有布丁和馅饼，”她说着，一手拿着篮子，另一只手伸向他。男巫立刻接过来。每当保姆做饭的时候，都是最美好的一天。

It was one thing to discomfit humans.  
让人类感到尴尬是一回事。

It was a pleasure of entirely another kind to discomfit demons, who thought themselves beyond it.  
这是一种完全不同的愉悦，让那些自以为无法被打败的恶魔感到尴尬。

Aziraphale made her way through the grim and grimy hallways of the third tier of Hell, dressed with the kind of refinement she reserved for gently and constantly grinding against Harriet Dowling’s burgeoning self-doubt. The collar was high, the skirt was modest, the shoes were sensible and she had never looked more out of place in her long life.  
阿齐拉费尔穿过第三层地狱阴暗肮脏的走廊，穿着她专门为了轻柔而持续地磨砺哈里特·道林日益增长的自我怀疑而保留的那种优雅。领口高高的，裙子保守得体，鞋子实用舒适，她在漫长的生命中从未显得如此格格不入。

Perhaps, the string of pearls with a crucifix was overkill, but she had no patience for their little games and if they wanted to rush her, they could deal with it.  
也许，带有十字架的珍珠项链有点过火，但她对他们的小把戏已经没有耐心了，如果他们想要催促她，那就由他们去应付吧。

Hastur, of course, was the first one to question it. “What the Heaven are you meant to be?” he spluttered, his eyes running over her from head to toe.  
哈斯特尔当然是第一个质疑的人。“你到底是什么东西？”他结结巴巴地说着，目光从头到脚扫视着她。

Aziraphale smiled delightfully at him. “Exactly what I’m expected to be, my dear. Why?” She leaned closer. “Soft, religious humans your kink?”  
亚齐拉费尔开心地对他笑了笑。“亲爱的，我正是被期望的那个人。为什么？”她靠近了一些。“温柔、虔诚的人类是你的喜好吗？”

It made him splutter even more, and she turned – fighting down a smirk – as Lord Beelzebub strode into the room.  
这让他更加咳嗽不止，而她转过身去——压制住一丝得意的笑容——贝利泽布勋爵大步走进房间。

“Tell us about the boy, Warlock,” they commanded, stopping dead in front of Aziraphale. Of course, Lord Beelzebub wasn’t one to be fazed, but they _had_ known Aziraphale a lot longer and tended to be unsurprised by anything he did, which was always a little disappointing.  
“告诉我们关于那个男孩的事情，术士，”他们命令道，停在亚齐拉费尔面前。当然，贝尔撒巴并不是那种容易受到影响的人，但他们认识亚齐拉费尔的时间更长，对他的一切行为都不感到惊讶，这总是有点令人失望。

“Oh, he’s a remarkable boy, Lord Beelzebub,” Aziraphale said, smiling.  
“哦，他是个了不起的孩子，比利泽布伯爵，”亚齐拉费尔微笑着说道。

“But is he evil?” Hastur demanded.  
“但他是邪恶的吗？”哈斯图尔要求道。

“Working his way through breaking all the Commandments as we speak,” Aziraphale replied not without a little pride. Warlock had proved as absorbent as a sponge when it came to learning profanities.  
“正如我们所说，他正在一一违反所有的戒律，”亚齐拉费尔不无自豪地回答道。当涉及学习亵渎语言时，沃洛克被证明像海绵一样吸收力强。

Ligur leered. “Kill anyone yet?”  
利古尔斜眼一瞥。“杀了人了吗？”

Of course, that silly wretch would prioritise death and destruction over the true art of corruption.  
当然，那个愚蠢的家伙更看重死亡和毁灭，而不是真正的腐败艺术。

“Not yet,” she said with a dismissive wave of her hand. “But there’s far more to evil than death, you know. Keeping them alive to torment them is so much more… challenging.”  
“还没有，”她挥了挥手，不屑地说道。“但邪恶远不止于死亡，你知道的。让他们活着受折磨才更有趣……更具挑战性。”

Ligur snorted disdainfully. “Yeah, but it’s not as much fun.”  
利古尔不屑地哼了一声。“是啊，但没那么有趣。”

Lord Beelzebub stepped closer to Aziraphale, ignoring the other demons. “Have you encountered any problems from the…” Their face twisted in distaste, “Opposition?”  
贝尔撒巴步近阿齐拉费尔，无视其他恶魔。“你遇到过来自……”他们的脸扭曲出厌恶之色，“对立势力的任何问题吗？”

“Lord, no!” Aziraphale beamed. And, for once, it wasn’t entirely a lie. After all, she and Crowley made sure Miss Ashtoreth and Mr. Francis were never seen in the same place at the same time. At least not by anyone who might compromise them. Warlock hardly counted. “I’m not sure any of them even know we’re there.”  
“主啊，不要！”亚齐拉费尔笑容满面。这一次，这并不完全是谎言。毕竟，她和克劳利确保了阿什托雷斯小姐和弗朗西斯先生从未同时出现在同一个地方。至少不会被可能危及他们的人看到。沃洛克几乎不算数。“我不确定他们中的任何人都知道我们在那里。”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

“And if we keep going at this pace,” Crowley said, a painfully broad smile plastered on his face, “we may win him back to our side.”  
“如果我们以这样的速度继续下去，”克劳利说着，脸上挤出一丝痛苦的宽笑，“我们可能会把他重新争取到我们这边来。”

His voice echoed back around him, the vast cavernous empty halls of Heaven the worst kind of echo chamber. He sounded even weaker than he’d realised. How was he meant to convince the Archangels of anything when he sounded more like a frighten foliot than a former Cherub? It didn’t help when they were all dressed to the nines and he looked like he’d come in from a youth club after an all-nighter.  
他的声音在他周围回荡，天堂宽敞空旷的大厅成了最糟糕的回音室。他听起来比他意识到的还要虚弱。当他听起来更像是一个受惊的小精灵而不是一个曾经的基路伯时，他该如何说服大天使们相信他的话呢？而当他们都穿着一身华丽的服装，而他看起来像是从一个通宵狂欢的青年俱乐部走出来时，这一切都没有帮助。

The crash of Gabriel’s hands as he applauded was like a thunderclap. He was flanked by three other angels: Michael, Uriel and Sandalphon, all of whom were watching Crowley with expressions ranging from polite suspicion to blatant dislike.  
加百列鼓掌时的撞击声如同一声雷鸣。他身旁站着三位其他的天使：迈克尔、乌列尔和桑达尔芬，他们都用各种表情注视着克劳利，从礼貌的怀疑到明目张胆的厌恶不一而足。

“Very commendable, Raziel,” Gabriel said, smiling warmly. “Excellent work.”  
“非常值得称赞，Raziel，”加百列温暖地笑着说道。“出色的工作。”

Crowley tried to smile in return, but hearing that name again and seeing the disdainful looks on the faces of the other three angels as they unenthusiastically applauded, reminded him how much he really didn’t want to be there. No matter what he did, even if he managed to Redeem the damned Antichrist, it would never be enough to wipe out his so-called great crime.  
克劳利试图回以微笑，但再次听到那个名字并看到其他三位天使脸上的轻蔑表情，他想起自己是多么不想在那里。无论他做什么，即使他设法拯救了该死的敌基督，也永远无法抹去他所谓的重罪。

“Yes,” Michael lowered their hands first, smiling coolly at him. “But Raziel, we will be most understanding when you fail.”  
“是的，”迈克尔先放下了他们的手，冷冷地对他微笑着。“但是，Raziel，当你失败时，我们会非常理解。”

On either side of them, Gabriel and the other angels nodded in agreement.  
在他们的两侧，加百列和其他天使都点头表示同意。

Of course, Crowley thought unsteadily. Six thousand years and he was never going to be good enough, no matter what he did.  
当然，克劳利颤抖地想着。六千年来，无论他做什么，他永远不会足够好。

“After all,” Michael continued, still smiling. “Wars are to be _won_.”  
“毕竟，”迈克尔继续说道，依然面带微笑。“战争是要赢的。”

“Not,” Uriel put in, dark eyes narrowed at him, “avoided.”  
“不是”，乌里尔插话道，黑眼睛紧盯着他，“避免”。

“I won’t fail,” he said with as much defiance as he could muster. “I’m going to save him.”  
他尽力地说：“我不会失败的。我要救他。”

Gabriel stepped forward, taking his shoulders. “Raziel, we get it. We know you us to see how hard you’re working on our behalf. It’s… praiseworthy, but ultimately, it’s doomed to failure.” He gave Crowley’s shoulders a painfully tight squeeze. “Still, this will be remembered.”  
加百列迈步向前，抓住了拉齐尔的肩膀。“拉齐尔，我们明白了。我们知道你想让我们看到你为我们努力工作的艰辛。这是值得赞扬的，但最终注定会失败。”他痛苦地用力捏了捏克劳利的肩膀。“不过，这将被铭记。”

Remembered. Yes. They were very good at remembering.  
记得。是的。他们非常擅长记忆。

They still remembered Raziel after all.  
他们毕竟还记得Raziel。

He cleared his throat self-consciously. “I-I do have– can I ask a favour?”  
他有些不好意思地清了清嗓子。“我-我确实有-我可以请求一个帮忙吗？”

Gabriel raised his eyebrows in surprise, dropping his hands. “Of course,” he said, though it was the ‘of course’ of someone who really didn’t want to be asked anything at all.  
加布里埃尔惊讶地挑起了眉毛，放下了双手。“当然了，”他说，尽管这是一个真的不想被问任何问题的人的“当然了”。

“I–” Crowley clenched his hands by his sides. “I’ve been using Crowley as my name on earth. So the humans don’t get suspicious of who I really am. Can– do you mind calling me that instead of Raziel? Just to make things simpler?”  
“我——”克劳利双手紧握在身旁。“我在地球上一直使用克劳利作为我的名字，这样人类就不会怀疑我的真实身份。你介意叫我克劳利而不是拉齐尔吗？这样会简单些。”

Gabriel laughed out loud. “Why would I do that?” he said, shaking his head. “You _are_ Raziel. Raziel of the Book, no less. Why wouldn’t you want to be called by your name?”  
加布里埃尔大声笑了起来。“我为什么要那样做？”他摇了摇头说道。“你是拉齐埃尔，更何况是《圣经》中的拉齐埃尔。你为什么不想被称呼你的名字呢？”

As the other Archangels filed passed him, their expressions saying more than words ever could, he looked down at his feet.  
当其他大天使们走过他身边时，他们的表情胜过千言万语，他低头看着自己的脚。

Why indeed? 为什么呢？

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The bus was almost empty as Aziraphale made her way up the stairs and she spotted Crowley in the empty back row, staring moodily out of the window. His gardener disguise was gone, his face clean-shaven, though his hair was still long enough to be pulled back into a braid.  
当阿齐拉菲尔上楼梯时，公交车几乎是空的，她在空荡荡的后排发现了克劳利，他愁眉苦脸地望着窗外。他的园丁伪装已经消失了，脸上没有胡须，但头发还是足够长，可以扎成一个辫子。

She swayed her way along the moving upper deck and swung into the seat in front of him, reclining back against the window with a long-suffering sigh.  
她摇摇晃晃地走过摇晃的上层甲板，摆动身体坐到他面前的座位上，靠在窗户上，发出一声长叹。

Crowley flinched in surprise as if he hadn’t even noticed her approach. His tongue darted out to wet his lips and he leaned forward. “He’s too normal,” he confided.  
克劳利惊讶地畏缩了一下，仿佛他甚至没有注意到她的靠近。他伸出舌头舔了舔嘴唇，向前倾身。“他太正常了，”他信任地说道。

“Which was the end-goal, wasn’t it?” Aziraphale murmured, her eyes half-closed, though she watched him from beneath her lashes. He looked more fraught and distracted than usual and it pained her that she couldn’t reach out and smooth that line between his brows. “A no-score draw, remember?”  
“这不就是最终目标吗？”阿齐拉费尔低声说道，她半闭着眼睛，却从睫毛下注视着他。他看起来比平常更加焦虑和心神不宁，让她感到痛心的是，她无法伸手抚平他眉间的皱纹。“平局，记得吗？”

Crowley nodded stiffly, staring back out of the window, that worrying line deepening even more.  
克劳利僵硬地点了点头，目光坚定地望向窗外，那令人担忧的皱纹更加深了。

“Give the thought voice, my dear,” she murmured. “Best not to let it fester.”  
“亲爱的，让思想有声音吧，”她低声说道。“最好不要让它滋生。”

He was quiet for a moment, then asked in little more than a whisper, “If– let’s say–” He took a shaking breath. “If it goes wrong and he comes into his full power, what the hell are we meant to do?”  
他静静地沉默了一会儿，然后小声问道：“如果——假设——”他颤抖着呼吸了一口气。“如果出了问题，他完全发挥出自己的力量，我们到底该怎么办？”

The thought had occurred to Aziraphale more than once, but she tried not to think about it too much for fear it would drown out every other thought in her head. After all, there was ineffability to take into account. “Oh, I’m sure we have nothing to worry about,” she lied.    
这个念头曾多次出现在阿齐拉费尔的脑海中，但她尽量不去过多思考，因为她担心它会淹没她头脑中的其他所有想法。毕竟，还有无法言喻的因素需要考虑在内。“哦，我相信我们没有什么可担心的，”她撒了个谎。

From Crowley’s expression, he felt exactly the same way. “Oh well,” he said with a brittle laugh. “Only six years left to go.”  
从克劳利的表情来看，他感受到了完全相同的情绪。“唉，”他带着一声干笑说道。“只剩下六年了。”

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Time has passed as time is prone to do and a small boy becomes a slightly larger boy.  
时间如同它的本性一般流逝，一个小男孩渐渐长大成为一个稍微大一点的男孩。

An angel and a demon – no longer a gardener and a nanny – sat on a bench in Crystal Palace Park, watching the child who was no longer in their care. He was walking with his mother, who was excitedly pointing out the hideous statues of the dinosaurs.  
一个天使和一个恶魔——不再是一个园丁和一个保姆——坐在水晶宫公园的长椅上，看着那个不再是他们照顾的孩子。他正和他的母亲一起走着，母亲兴奋地指着那些丑陋的恐龙雕像。

“Do you think we’ve done enough?” Crowley asked.  
“你觉得我们做得够了吗？”克劳利问道。

Aziraphale glanced sidelong at him. The angel looked much tenser than Aziraphale could ever recall him being before, his arms tightly folded over his chest, his dark eyes fixed on the boy. “We’ve done all that we feasibly _could_ do,” he murmured. “We aren’t invincible, my dear.”  
亚齐拉费尔斜眼瞥了他一眼。天使看起来比亚齐拉费尔以往见过的任何时候都要紧张得多，他双臂紧紧交叠在胸前，深邃的眼睛盯着那个男孩。“我们已经尽力了，”他低声说道。“亲爱的，我们并不是无敌的。”

Crowley nodded, his lips twisting and Lord, that ominous furrow was back between his eyes. “Right. Yeah. Course.” He took a shivering breath. “All we could.”  
克劳利点了点头，嘴角扭曲，上帝啊，那种不祥的皱纹又出现在他的眉间。“对。是的。当然。”他颤抖地呼吸了一口气。“我们尽力而为。”

Perhaps it was all the years of tending a child who enjoyed hugs and holding hands, but Aziraphale couldn’t help reaching out and giving Crowley’s nearest hand a gentle, reassuring squeeze. “Your mind is running away with you again, isn’t it?”  
或许是多年来照顾一个喜欢拥抱和牵手的孩子的结果，但是阿齐拉费尔忍不住伸出手，轻轻地安抚地握了一下克劳利最近的手。“你的思绪又开始飘忽不定了，是吗？”

Brown eyes flicked down to his hand, then back to his face, and Aziraphale immediately lifted his hand away, as if scolded. “A little, yeah,” Crowley admitted, his fingers flexing against his upper arm, his knuckles white as bone. “I just– it has to work. We can’t– it can’t just end like…” He shook his head. “I don’t know.”  
棕色的眼睛往下看了一下他的手，然后又回到他的脸上，亚齐拉费尔立刻把手收了回来，好像被责备了一样。“有一点，是的，”克劳利承认道，他的手指在上臂上屈伸，指关节白得像骨头。“我只是...它必须成功。我们不能...它不能就这样结束...”他摇了摇头。“我不知道。”

Aziraphale closed his hands one around the other to make sure he didn’t give the poor poppet anything else to worry about. “Whatever happens, we’ll know which way the dice will fall by his birthday.”  
亚齐拉费尔合上双手，确保他不会给可怜的小家伙增添任何烦恼。“无论发生什么，我们会通过他的生日来知道事情会如何发展。”

The angel’s head whipped around. “We will? Why?”  
天使的头突然转过来。“我们会吗？为什么？”

“Ah.” Aziraphale winced. “I forgot to mention. Memo from… below. They’re sending him a Hellhound.”  
“啊。”亚齐拉费尔痛苦地皱了皱眉。“我忘了提一下。来自……下面的备忘录。他们要派一个地狱猎犬给他。”

Crowley stared at him in horror. “You never said anything about a _Hellhound_!”  
克劳利惊恐地盯着他。“你从来没有提到过地狱猎犬！”

“I only found out a couple of days ago!” Aziraphale protested. “To be quite honest, I had no idea that they even still considered Familiar in fashion these days, but apparently they feel he needs a loyal companion to pad by his side and protect him from all harm.”  
“就在几天前我才发现！”阿齐拉费尔抗议道。“说实话，我根本不知道如今他们还认为熟悉的存在是时尚的，但显然他们觉得他需要一个忠诚的伴侣来陪伴他、保护他免受一切伤害。”

The angel looked back down the path. “I mean, I know his mum and dad are a bit useless, but surely they’re going to notice a bloody great big dog showing up? And Warlock doesn’t even like dogs! He hates the things!”  
天使回头看着前方的路。“我是说，我知道他父母有点没用，但他们肯定会注意到一只巨大的狗出现吧？而且沃洛克根本不喜欢狗！他讨厌它们！”

Aziraphale held up both hands in a warding gesture. “I know, dear, I know! You don’t need to shout at me!”  
亚齐拉费尔举起双手做出一个避讳的手势。“我知道，亲爱的，我知道！你不需要对我大声喊叫！”

Crowley looked distraught, pressing one of his fists to his mouth. “And they’re going to send it? There’s no way you can stop that?”  
克劳利看起来心烦意乱，一只拳头捂住了他的嘴。“他们会寄出去吗？你没有办法阻止吗？”

“If I could, you know I would.” Aziraphale gazed unhappily down at the boy. “They won’t even notice, you know. Regardless of their behaviour, it’s reality and Warlock can do whatever he pleases with that.” He glanced at the angel. “That’s the key, they said. The naming. He’s meant to name it, which seals his future. But,” he tried to infuse some hope into his voice, “if we’ve done our jobs properly, he’ll send it away unnamed.”  
“如果我能的话，你知道我会的。”亚齐拉费尔不快地注视着那个男孩。“他们甚至不会注意到，你知道吗。不管他们的行为如何，这是现实，沃洛克可以随心所欲地处理这个问题。”他瞥了一眼天使。“那是关键，他们说的。命名。他应该给它命名，这样就决定了他的未来。但是，”他试图在声音中注入一些希望，“如果我们做好了我们的工作，他会将它无名地送走。”

“He’d better,” Crowley said, a muscle in his jaw twitching. “He’s allergic!”  
“他最好这样做，”克劳利说道，下颌的肌肉抽搐了一下。“他对这个过敏！”

“He is?” "他是吗？"

The angel gave him a frosty look. “Who do you think gave him all those antihistamines?”  
天使冷冷地看着他。“你以为是谁给他那么多抗过敏药的？”

“Honestly?” Aziraphale admitted, “I thought he was stealing drugs from the staff. It looked good on me so I didn’t ask.”  
“说实话？”亚齐拉费尔承认道，“我以为他从员工那里偷药。这对我有好处，所以我没问。”

The angel’s lips thinned in that tight resistance against a smile. “Of course you didn’t.” He exhaled slowly, sinking back on the bench. “So… so, let’s say he does name it? I mean, he’s not going to, but if he does?”  
天使的嘴唇因为抵抗笑容而变得紧绷起来。“当然你不会知道。”他慢慢地呼出一口气，靠在长凳上。“那么...那么，假设他真的给它取名字了呢？虽然他不会这么做，但如果他真的这么做了呢？”

Aziraphale saw no reason to gild the lily. “We’re doomed.”  
亚齐拉费尔看不出任何理由来画蛇添足。“我们注定要失败。”

Crowley gave a tight little laugh. “That simple?”  
克劳利轻笑了一下。“就这么简单？”

Aziraphale nodded, gazing at him. “He’ll have all his powers and Armageddon will be days away.”  
亚齐拉费尔点了点头，凝视着他。“他将拥有全部的力量，而世界末日也将不远了。”

The angel breathed out a small sound that was almost a profanity. “We can’t just _sit_ here and wait for it to happen, Aziraphale. There _has_ to be some way of stopping it.”  
天使发出了一个几乎像是亵渎的小声音。“我们不能坐在这里等待它发生，阿齐拉费尔。一定有办法阻止它。”

A dreadful thought, one that had stagnated for eleven years, bubbled up in Aziraphale’s mind. It was all the more terrible for those small pink hands that had clasped his and the giggles and the secret troves of sweeties. “Technically, yes.”  
阿齐拉费尔脑海中涌起了一个可怕的念头，这个念头已经停滞了十一年。对于那些曾经握过他手的小粉红手和咯咯笑声以及秘密的糖果宝藏来说，这一切变得更加可怕。“从技术上讲，是的。”

The hope that illuminated the angel’s face was like a punch in the gut. “What is it?”  
天使脸上闪烁的希望如同一记重拳击中了胃。“怎么了？”

Aziraphale had to look away from him, staring down at his tightly-clasped hands. “If there was no… boy... the process would stop.”  
亚齐拉费尔不得不把目光移开，低头看着紧握的双手。“如果没有那个...男孩...整个过程就会停止。”

“No boy?” Crowley echoed, his frown audible. “What are you on about? We know there’s a boy.”  
“没有男孩？”克劳利回应道，他的皱眉声音听得见。“你在说什么？我们知道有个男孩。”

“There’s a boy _now_,” Aziraphale said carefully. “Something could… happen to him.” His hands clenched even tighter, his fingers going white, until he heard the sharp, comprehending breath.  
“现在有个男孩，”亚齐拉费尔小心地说道。“他可能会发生……什么事情。”他的手更紧地握着，指尖变得苍白，直到他听到那一声短促而理解的呼吸。

“Don’t you _dare_ say that,” the angel snarled.  
“你敢说出那样的话，”天使咆哮道。

Aziraphale forced himself to look at the angel. “It’s the only other option. You asked.”  
亚齐拉费尔努力看着那位天使。“这是唯一的另一个选择。你问的。”

“You could–” Crowley began, though his face was twisted in distress.  
“你可以——” 克劳利开始说，尽管他的脸上带着痛苦的扭曲。

“No.” Aziraphale forced a shaky smile. “I tried, you know. When they gave me it. Him. I was going to get rid of it, of _him_, but–” He laughed sharply. “I’m something of a coward, you see. I rather liked the idea of staying alive, long enough to find an alternative.” He met the angel’s stricken gaze. “You… as an agent of the divine…”  
“不。”亚齐拉费尔勉强笑了笑。“你知道吗，当他们把它给我时，我试过。他。我本来打算摆脱它，摆脱他，但是……”他尖锐地笑了笑。“我有点胆小，你知道。我更喜欢活下去的想法，足够长的时间去寻找替代方案。”他与天使的震惊目光相遇。“你……作为神圣的代理人……”

“No,” Crowley whispered hoarsely. “No! Don’t you dare!”  
“不，”克劳利嘶声低语道。“不！你敢动手试试！”

No small wonder, Aziraphale thought, pained. Crowley loved kids, but especially kids he spent time with. Lord, he _loved_ that cheeky little bastard they had helped to raise. “It would be him,” he pointed out as gently as he could, “or _everything_. One life for the world.”  
阿齐拉费尔心想，真是不足为奇，他感到痛苦。克劳利喜欢孩子，尤其是和他一起度过时间的孩子。天啊，他爱那个调皮的小混蛋，他们曾经帮助抚养过他。"要么是他，"他尽可能温柔地指出，“要么是一切。一个生命，换取整个世界。”

Crowley shook his head, his face contorted in pain. “No.” He got up, walking in a tight circle, the furrow carved so deep between his brow that Aziraphale longed to smooth it away. “This Hellhound,” he said suddenly, turning back to Aziraphale. “You said it’ll show up on his birthday?”  
克劳利摇了摇头，脸上扭曲着痛苦的表情。“不。”他站起身，在一个狭小的圈子里走来走去，眉间的皱纹深深地刻在他的额头上，让亚齐拉费尔渴望着能抚平它。“这只地狱猎犬，”他突然转身对亚齐拉费尔说。“你说它会在他的生日那天出现？”

Aziraphale nodded. “Wednesday. Around three, they said.”  
亚齐拉费尔点了点头。“星期三，大约三点左右，他们说的。”

“At his party,” Crowley murmured. The look on his face could only be described as wild. “Maybe I can stop it? I mean, they’re used to me hanging around in the gardens. Yeah, I quit, technically, but could just pop by to drop off his present, couldn’t I? Hang around? I mean, a tranquiliser gun might work on a Hellhound, yeah?”  
“在他的派对上，”克劳利低声说道。他脸上的表情只能用狂野来形容。“也许我能阻止它？我的意思是，他们习惯了我在花园里晃悠。是的，从技术上讲，我辞职了，但我可以顺便过去送他礼物，对吧？逗留一下？我的意思是，镇定剂枪对地狱犬管用吗？”

“Angel,” Aziraphale said, wincing. “Don’t. You can’t just swan back in. They’ll come down on you like a tonne of security-clearance-shaped bricks.”  
“天使，”阿齐拉费尔痛苦地说道。“别这样。你不能就这样回来。他们会像一堆安全许可证形状的砖头一样对你进行打击。”

“I could go in as the entertainment instead, then.”  
那我可以作为娱乐节目的替代者进去。

The demon’s brain felt like it had run into a brick wall. “I beg your pardon?”  
恶魔的脑袋感觉像是撞到了一堵墙。“请您再说一遍？”

“I still play the guitar,” Crowley said, sitting back down. “I distract Warlock and the kids, you subdue the dog, and we get away scot-free. Your lot will expect you to be there anyway. You just don’t tell them what you were doi–”  
“我还会弹吉他。”克劳利坐回去说道。“我会分散沃洛克和孩子们的注意力，你制服那只狗，我们就能安然逃脱。你的同伴们本来就会期待你在那里。只是你不要告诉他们你在做什么。”

“Can we go back to you on the guitar?” Aziraphale interrupted. “I don’t think kumbayah is going to do the job with Warlock and those hellions he calls friends.”  
“我们能回到你弹吉他的问题上吗？”阿齐拉费尔打断道。“我觉得唱《和平之歌》对于沃洛克和他那些恶魔朋友们来说可能不太管用。”

Crowley looked offended. “I can play more than kumbayah.”  
克劳利显得很生气。“我不仅仅会弹奏《和谐之歌》。”

“You said that when you tried the virginal in 1672,” Aziraphale said mildly. “Remember who had to keep the King from chopping your head off?”  
“你说过你在1672年试弹琴时，”亚齐拉费尔温和地说道。“还记得是谁阻止了国王砍下你的脑袋吗？”

“It’s not the same,” Crowley said indignantly. “Anyway, it’s not as if we really have any other choice, is it?”  
“这不一样，”克劳利愤愤地说道。“反正，我们也没有其他选择，不是吗？”

Aziraphale sighed, lifting his eyes skywards. Ineffable bleeding humour again. “If we go,” he warned, “you’re not playing the guitar.”  
亚齐拉费尔叹了口气，抬起眼睛望向天空。又是那无法言喻的讨厌幽默。"如果我们去的话，"他警告道，"你可不能弹吉他。"

Crowley’s eyes gleamed mutinously. “Of course not,” he said and for once, Aziraphale wished he couldn’t taste the lie.  
克劳利的眼睛闪烁着叛逆的光芒。“当然不会，”他说道，而阿齐拉费尔却希望自己无法品味到这个谎言。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

On a scale of eleventh birthday parties, the birthday party of Warlock Dowling was a good one.  
在十一岁生日派对的尺度上，术士道林的生日派对算是一次不错的派对。

If you took a look around, you’d see the carousel and helter skelter outside, and inside the marquee all the worst kinds of food so beloved by children all over the world. The pile of presents could easily have crushed a small child, should a small child decide the parcel from the bottom was much more interesting than the parcel at the top.  
如果你四处看看，你会看到外面的旋转木马和螺旋滑梯，而帐篷里面则是全世界孩子们最喜欢的那些最糟糕的食物。那堆礼物很容易压垮一个小孩，如果一个小孩决定从底部的包裹比顶部的包裹更有趣的话。

It was hardly worth noticing that on a table beside the Everest of Capitalism, there were two smaller parcels that seemed to have been placed there as an afterthought. One had all the thinness and flatness that suggested the contents were either a very squashed guinea pig or a book. The other was a neat, square box wrapped in plain brown paper with a label marked ‘To Warlock from Mr. Francis’. Parcels like that never got much attention until much later, when they became the favourite gifts of all.  
在资本主义的珠穆朗玛峰旁边的桌子上，有两个小包裹似乎是事后放在那里的，几乎不值得注意。其中一个非常薄，扁平，看起来像是一个被压扁的豚鼠或一本书。另一个是一个整洁的方形盒子，用普通的棕色纸包裹着，上面贴着一个标签，上面写着“给巫师，来自弗朗西斯先生”。这样的包裹直到后来才引起了更多的关注，成为了最受欢迎的礼物。

The only thing that could have ruined the party was if someone – who thought they were a pretty good musician – decided to perform some optimistically cheerful variations on 90s pop songs on an acoustic guitar. Especially when the birthday boy knew that a _real_ pop star had cancelled at the last minute.  
唯一可能破坏派对的事情就是如果有人——自以为是一位相当不错的音乐家——决定用木吉他演奏一些乐观愉快的90年代流行歌曲的变奏。尤其是在寿星知道一位真正的流行歌星在最后一刻取消了出席的情况下。

“Do you think he knows how rubbish he is?” One of the small boys spoke up with all the authority of Simon Cowell and twice the charisma.  
“你觉得他知道自己有多糟糕吗？”其中一个小男孩以西蒙·考威尔的权威感和双倍的魅力说道。

The singer blinked in surprise, his hands freezing on the guitar. “Um…” He looked around the tent at all the children, his eyes almost hidden under shaggy red hair. “So… how about this one? Here’s Wonderwall.”  
歌手惊讶地眨了眨眼睛，手上的吉他停住了。"嗯..."他环顾着帐篷里的所有孩子，他的眼睛几乎被蓬乱的红发遮住了。"那么...这首怎么样？这是《奇迹之墙》。"

“Ugh!” A girl groaned. “He’s the worst!”  
“唉！”一个女孩抱怨道。“他真是太糟糕了！”

The birthday boy glared at her, because yes, the man in his weird floppy hair and stupid suit was rubbish, but it was his party and he was the only one allowed to say that.  
生日男孩怒视着她，因为是的，那个头发奇怪、穿着愚蠢西装的男人真是个废物，但这是他的派对，只有他有权这么说。

“But he is!” The girl made a face back at him. “Hey! Mister! You suck!”  
"但他就是这样！"女孩朝他做了个鬼脸。“嘿！先生！你真糟糕！”

Later, no one could decide who threw the first bowl of trifle, but it hit that small girl squarely on the back of the head, exploding in a cloud of jelly, cream, fruit and custard. Certainly no one gave a black-suited waited with white-blond hair a second look as he slipped out of the marquee as if he’d never been there.  
后来，没有人能确定是谁先扔了那碗杂糅甜点，但它正好砸在那个小女孩的脑袋后面，爆炸成一团果冻、奶油、水果和蛋奶酱的云雾。当然，没有人会再多看一眼那个穿着黑色西装、白金色头发的侍者，他悄然离开帐篷，仿佛他从未出现过一样。

The unfortunate girl shrieked like the world was about to end and Warlock Dowling started to laugh and ran for the table of beautifully-prepared mini-meals. Within seconds, the tent had devolved into anarchy.  
不幸的女孩尖叫起来，就像世界即将末日一样，巫师道林开始笑了起来，跑向摆满精心准备的小餐的桌子。几秒钟后，帐篷陷入了混乱。

Outside of the tent, the musician and the waiter hurried around the back of the house.  
帐篷外，音乐家和服务员匆忙地绕过房子的后面。

“You didn’t need to do that,” Crowley said with gentle reproach. “She was just a child.”  
“你不需要这样做。”克劳利温和地责备道，“她只是个孩子。”

Aziraphale snorted. “She was a brat who had it coming.” He looked at his watch again then scanned around the grounds. “It’s late.”  
亚齐拉费尔嗤笑了一声。“她是个该受到惩罚的顽童。”他再次看了看手表，然后环顾四周。“已经很晚了。”

Crowley opened the car to shove the guitar case into the back seat. “Maybe they only released it at three?” He suggested optimistically, though his shoulders sagged under the demon’s impatient look. “Yeah, I know. Automatic manifestation.”  
克劳利打开车门，将吉他盒塞进后座。“也许他们只在三点发布？”他乐观地建议道，尽管他的肩膀在恶魔不耐烦的目光下垂了下来。“是的，我知道。自动显现。”

“I don’t understand,” Aziraphale said, sounded both wounded and offended as he slipped into the passenger seat. “Maybe they didn’t release it after all? Why didn’t they tell me?”  
“我不明白。”阿齐拉费尔说道，他的语气既受伤又愤怒，他坐进了副驾驶座位。“也许他们根本没有发布吧？为什么他们不告诉我？”

Crowley touched the ignition, the engine purring to life. The radio blared and he nearly jumped out his skin when Nicholas Parsons said, “Hello Aziraphale.”  
克劳利碰了一下点火开关，引擎嗡嗡作响地启动了起来。收音机突然大声播放起来，当尼古拉斯·帕森斯说出“你好，阿齐拉费尔”的时候，他差点吓得跳了起来。

“Wh–?” “什么？”

Aziraphale slapped a hand over Crowley’s mouth, muffling him, a panicked look on his face. “Um. Hello? Who’s speaking?”  
亚齐拉费尔用手掌掩住克劳利的嘴巴，使他无法说话，脸上带着惊慌的表情。“嗯，你好？谁在说话？”

“Dagon,” Nicholas Parsons said. “Lord of the Files. Master of Torments.”  
“达贡，”尼古拉斯·帕森斯说道。“文件之主。折磨之师。”

Over Aziraphale’s hand, Crowley’s eyes widened in dismay as Aziraphale mouthed a very visible profanity. He’d always wondered why Aziraphale tended to avoid modern media devices, limiting himself to a record player instead of bothering with radios and televisions. Now, he could understand why. At least angels only showed up in person and rarely at that.  
在亚齐拉费尔的手上，克劳利的眼睛惊恐地睁大，因为亚齐拉费尔嘴里咬出了一个非常明显的脏话。他一直想知道为什么亚齐拉费尔倾向于避免现代媒体设备，只限于使用唱片机，而不烦恼收音机和电视。现在，他终于明白了。至少天使只会亲自出现，而且很少这样做。

“Ah! Dagon! Of course!” Aziraphale said brightly. “Ah… yes. What can I do for you?”  
“啊！达贡！当然！”亚齐拉费尔兴高采烈地说道。“啊...是的。有什么我可以帮你的吗？”

“Just checking in on the progress with the Hellhound.” Nicholas Parsons sounded far too gleeful. “Was it as terrible as they all said?”  
“只是来看看地狱猎犬的进展。”尼古拉斯·帕森斯听起来过于愉快。“它真的像大家说的那样可怕吗？”

Aziraphale shot Crowley a frantic look and mouthed another profanity. “So it was sent then?” It was amazing how relaxed he sounded, given the sheer blinding panic on his face.  
亚齐拉费尔焦急地朝克劳利投去一瞥，并嘴里咒骂了一句。"那么它已经被发送了？"令人惊讶的是，尽管他脸上表现出了极度的恐慌，他的语气却如此轻松。

There was a momentary silence from the radio. “Of course it was,” Nicholas Parsons said. “Why? Is something… wrong?”  
收音机上突然安静了一会儿。“当然是这样，”尼古拉斯·帕森斯说。“怎么了？有什么问题吗？”

“Wrong? No! No, not at all! The grounds are damned big, that’s– oh, I see it now!” Aziraphale’s laugh sounded almost convincing to anyone who hadn’t know him as long as Crowley had. He was as grey as week-old coffee.  “My word, he’s a big fellow, isn’t it? And yes! He’s huge! I didn’t know they came that large!” He reached down and switched the radio off, then dropped his other hand from Crowley’s face. The expression on his face said it all.  
“错了吗？不！不，一点也不错！地面可是非常大的，那个...哦，我现在明白了！” 如果不是和克劳利相处时间不长的人，阿齐拉费尔的笑声听起来几乎是真实的。他的脸色苍白得像一周前的咖啡。 “我的天，它真是个大家伙，不是吗？而且是的！它巨大！我不知道它们会长得那么大！” 他伸手关掉收音机，然后把另一只手从克劳利的脸上拿开。他脸上的表情已经说明了一切。

Crowley stared out through the windscreen. “No dog,” he murmured.  
克劳利透过挡风玻璃凝视着外面。“没有狗，”他低声说道。

“No dog,” Aziraphale said, sounding equally shaken.  
“没有狗。”阿齐拉费尔说道，语气同样震惊。

Crowley looked at him. If the Hellhound had been released and it definitely wasn’t here, that could only mean one thing and all their time and energy had been targeted in the wrong place. “Wrong boy?”  
克劳利看着他。如果地狱猎犬已经被释放，而它明显不在这里，那只能意味着一件事，他们所有的时间和精力都被投入到了错误的地方。“错了吗？”

The demon slowly nodded. “Wrong boy.”  
恶魔缓缓点头。“错了，小子。”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Aziraphale hadn’t said a word the whole way back to Crowley’s place, not even to complain about the car. His hands had been fixed, clenched, over his knees and he had stared at a point somewhere beyond the dashboard.  
亚齐拉费尔一路回到克劳利的住所，一言不发，甚至没有抱怨车子的事。他的双手紧紧地握在膝盖上，目光凝视着仪表盘之外的某个点。

Crowley had kept one eye on him, worried.  
克劳利一直紧盯着他，心生忧虑。

It wasn’t like him to go quiet. Loud, angry, bombastic, yes. Closed down and quiet felt wrong somehow.  
他不是那种安静的人。大声、愤怒、夸夸其谈，是的。但他沉默寡言，让人感到不对劲。

He got the demon back through the doors of the chapter house and he seemed to be moving on autopilot until Crowley cracked opened the seal on a bottle of Scotch.  
他把恶魔带回了议事厅的门口，看起来他像是在自动驾驶一样，直到克劳利打开了一瓶苏格兰威士忌。

“Days until Armageddon,” the demon said slowly, “and we’ve lost the Antichrist.”  
“末日倒计时，”恶魔缓慢地说道，“而我们已经失去了那位敌基督。”

Crowley returned to the couch, where – for once – Aziraphale was sitting upright, both feet on the floor. He held out one of the glasses to the demon, the bottle tucked against his side. He had a feeling they’d be needing it. “This’ll help.”  
克劳利回到沙发上，阿齐拉费尔这次坐得笔直，双脚踩在地板上。他递给恶魔其中一个杯子，酒瓶夹在他的身边。他有一种感觉，他们会需要它。“这会有帮助的。”

Aziraphale knocked back the finger of Scotch and held out the glass again. “Not enough.”  
亚齐拉费尔一口气喝下一口苏格兰威士忌，然后再次递出杯子。“还不够。”

The angel folded down to sit beside him, one leg tucked under him, and refilled the demon’s glass.  
天使坐在他旁边，一条腿蜷在身下，给恶魔倒满了酒杯。

The contents vanished just as quickly and Aziraphale sagged back against the back of the couch with a shudder. “If I didn’t know better,” he admitted, rolling the glass between his hands, “I’d almost think they were doing this to play silly buggers with me.” He gave Crowley a pained look. “Why me? What the Heaven did I do to get picked for the worst job in history?”  
内容消失得就像是一闪而过，亚齐拉费尔颤抖着倒在沙发的靠背上。“如果我不知道更多的话，”他承认着，双手握着玻璃杯来回摩擦，“我几乎会认为他们是在拿我开玩笑。”他痛苦地看着克劳利。“为什么是我？我到底做了什么，竟然被选中做历史上最糟糕的工作？”

Crowley leaned forward, waiting until the glass stopped moving, to refill it again. “Could be all those memos you kept on sending them. F’you hadn’t gone on about being the cause of the first World War or that time you made the Spanish Inquisition, they’d’ve picked someone else.”  
克劳利向前倾身，等待着玻璃停止晃动，然后再次倒满酒。“可能是你一直发给他们的那些备忘录。如果你没有提到自己是第一次世界大战的起因，或者你制造了西班牙宗教裁判所的那次，他们本可以选择其他人。”

“Excuse me!” Aziraphale exclaimed indignantly. “You can’t blame me for their lax approach to management!”  
“对不起！”阿齐拉费尔愤然地喊道。“你不能责怪我对他们管理方式的放松态度！”

“Their lax approach to management that you manipulated to your advantage,” Crowley reminded him mildly. “Which means that you’re so good at being bad at your job that they take it all for being good at your job. Which is being bad.”  
克劳利温和地提醒他：“他们对管理的懈怠态度正是你利用的对象。这意味着你在工作上表现得如此糟糕，以至于他们将其视为你工作出色的表现。而实际上，你的工作表现是糟糕的。”

Aziraphale squinted at him. “I’m either too drunk or not drunk enough, because that made no sense whatsoever.” He drained the glass again and held it out demandingly.  
亚齐拉费尔皱起眉头看着他。“要么我喝醉了，要么没喝够，因为那一点道理都没有。”他再次喝光杯中的酒，然后要求再倒一杯。

Crowley tilted the bottle and yelped when Aziraphale dropped his glass and whisky spattered on the couch between them. “Azira–”  
克劳利倾斜着瓶子，当阿齐拉费尔不小心把杯子掉落，威士忌溅在他们之间的沙发上时，他惊叫了一声。“阿齐拉——”

“Something’s changed.” The demon was staring blindly into the air, his nostrils flaring. His eyes widened and there could be no mistaking the anger and fear that flooded his face. “The hound has found his master.”  
“有些事情变了。”恶魔盲目地凝视着空气，鼻孔扩张着。他的眼睛睁大，无法忽视他脸上涌现的愤怒和恐惧。“猎犬找到了主人。”

Crowley’s stomach twisted. “Are you sure?”  
克劳利的胃一阵翻腾。“你确定吗？”

Serpentine blue eyes stared at him. “Do you think I would lie about this, my dear?”  
蛇一般的蓝眼睛盯着他。“亲爱的，你觉得我会撒谎吗？”

No. Of course he wouldn’t.  
当然不会。

“Oh.” Crowley looked down into his glass. It was too wet. Needed to be empty. He drained it, then poured himself another measure and drained that too. “Oh, well…” He gave Aziraphale a bitter smile that felt like was going to slide off his face. “Here’s to the end times.”  
“哦。”克劳利低头看着他的杯子。太湿了。需要倒空。他喝光了，然后又倒了一杯，也喝光了。“哦，好吧……”他给了亚齐拉费尔一个苦涩的微笑，感觉好像要从脸上滑落下来。“为了末日。”

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Sunlight was slanting down over the roof of the community centre, illuminating the small garden on the south side.  
阳光斜射在社区中心屋顶上，照亮了南侧的小花园。

A dedicated troop of children aged between five and fifteen were meticulously working on the vegetable plot, supervised by a couple of sun-basking adults and a red-haired man in jeans and a t-shirt with a cartoon of a hedgehog on it and the caption “Living on the Hedge”.  
一支由五至十五岁的孩子组成的专属小队正在细心地在菜地上工作，由几位晒太阳的成年人和一位穿着牛仔裤和印有刺猬卡通图案以及“生活在刺猬上”的字样的红发男子监督。

The red-haired man was helping one of the small girls, a tiny child with beautifully-braided hair and beads that matched her purple glasses, to move a seedling from pot to bed when a shadow stretched over him and a horribly familiar voice said, “_Ahem_.”  
红发男子正在帮助其中一个小女孩，一个头发编得漂亮、佩戴着紫色眼镜的小孩，将一株幼苗从盆中移植到花床上。就在此时，一个阴影笼罩了他，一个可怕而熟悉的声音说道：“咳咳。”

Crowley’s heart sank and he looked up, the sun blotted out by the ever-elegant figure of Gabriel. He got to his feet and self-consciously wiped down his dirty hands on his already filthy jeans. That was when he noticed the other angel standing behind the Archangel. Sandalphon. One of the angels best known for inflicting God’s wrath.  
克劳利的心沉了下去，他抬起头，太阳被永远优雅的加百列遮住了。他站了起来，不好意思地用已经脏兮兮的牛仔裤擦拭着自己的脏手。就在这时，他注意到另一个天使站在大天使的身后。桑达尔芬。他是众所周知的天使之一，擅长施加上帝的愤怒。

Oh. Shit. 哦，该死。

“Gabriel.” He forced a smile. “What’s up?”  
“加布里埃尔。”他勉强笑了笑。“怎么了？”

Gabriel’s smile was a little bit too fixed and he was even stiffer than usual. It was the humans, Crowley realised, astonished. He had frozen up because he was surrounded by dozens of small, rudely-staring human children, who didn’t give a damn who he was. One of the skinny little brown-haired boys even dared to approach, holding up a handful of dirt and worms.  
加百利的微笑有点僵硬，他比平常还要拘谨。克劳利意识到，这是因为人类。他僵住了，因为他被几十个盯着他看的小人类孩子包围着，他们根本不在乎他是谁。其中一个瘦小的棕发男孩甚至敢走近，手里拿着一把泥土和蠕虫。

Gabriel recoiled a step, lips twisting in distaste. He glared at Crowley as if it was his fault. “Can we talk privately?”  
加布里埃尔退了一步，嘴唇扭曲出厌恶的表情。他怒视着克劳利，仿佛这是他的错。"我们能私下谈谈吗？"

Part of Crowley wanted to say no, to stand there, look the Archangel in the eyes, and watch him squirm. But sometimes, his better nature took charge. “We can go inside,” he said and though he didn’t take his eyes off the other angel, he spoke to the kids, “I need you lot to behave yourselves, all right?”  
克劳利的一部分想要说不，站在那里，直视大天使的眼睛，看着他挣扎。但有时，他更好的本性会占据上风。“我们可以进去，”他说道，虽然他没有移开目光，但他对孩子们说道，“我希望你们都能自己好好表现，好吗？”

The chorus of “yes, uncle Tony” would normally have made him feel a thousand times better, but not when he felt like he had a rock in his belly and two formidable Archangels walking oppressively close behind him.  
“是的，托尼叔叔”的合唱通常会让他感觉好上千倍，但当他感觉肚子里有块石头，两个强大的大天使紧随其后时，这种感觉并没有让他感到更好。

As soon as they were through the door, Crowley shut it behind them, pausing to take a steadying breath and straightening his back before he turned around.  
他们一进门，克劳利就把门关上，停下来深吸一口气，挺直了背后才转身。

“Humans are so _disgusting_,” Gabriel said with a shudder. “The sooner they’re out of the way, the better.”  
“人类真是太恶心了。”加布里埃尔颤抖着说道。“他们越早消失，越好。”

Crowley’s cheeks hurt from the effort of forcing a smile. His hands bunched by his sides. “Mm.”  His eyes flicked to the other angel, who was lurking as ominously present as Gabriel’s shadow.  
克劳利勉力挤出一个微笑，脸颊因此而疼痛。他的双手紧握在身旁。“嗯。”他的目光转向另一个天使，他就像加百列的阴影一样神秘地存在着。

“Oh!” Gabriel’s usual smile returned. “You remember Sandalphon?”  
“哦！”加百列的平常笑容回来了。“你还记得桑达尔芬吗？”

Oh Lord, Crowley wished he could forget. The curse of an angel, that. Long memories. “Sodom and Gomorrah,” he said, trying his best to sound admiring instead of sickened. He’d seen the smouldering ruins and heard the keening howls of grief of those who had known people in the cities. “You… really let them have it there.”  
哦，上帝啊，克劳利真希望自己能够忘记。那是天使的诅咒，长久的记忆。他试图尽力表现得赞赏而不是恶心：“所多玛和蛾摩拉，”他说道。他曾见过那些冒烟的废墟，听过那些在城市中失去亲人的人们哀嚎的悲痛。“你……真的让他们付出了代价。”

Sandalphon grinned, showing the inhuman flicker of gold across his teeth. He wasn’t one who came to earth often enough to care about social niceties like ‘seeming completely human’.  
桑达尔芬咧嘴一笑，牙齿间闪过一丝非人类的金光。他并不经常来到地球，对于像“看起来完全像人类”这样的社交礼仪并不在意。

Crowley looked between them. They looked so out of place here. Even if it was a former church, they looked like they should be down in the Shard or somewhere near Canary Wharf.  
克劳利在他们之间来回看了看。他们在这里显得格外不合适。即使这是一座前教堂，他们看起来就像应该在碎片大厦或金丝雀码头附近。

Bit bloody ironic that the place the angels didn’t fit in was a former church, with light pouring in through the tall windows on the array of art projects that were going on. The stage was partly set up for rehearsals for the concert on Saturday. The boxes for the food drive stood by one wall. It looked bright and busy and home.  
有点血腥的讽刺，天使们不适应的地方竟然是一座前教堂，高窗户透进光线，照亮了各种艺术项目。舞台部分布置好，准备周六的音乐会彩排。食物捐赠箱子靠在一面墙边。这里看起来明亮繁忙，有家的感觉。

And, he thought guiltily, it looked _nothing_ like Heaven. What did it say about him that his primary place of work and living looked so messy and chaotic and so very human? Was that what they saw in him, when they looked at him now too?  
而且，他心里感到内疚，这看起来一点也不像天堂。他的主要工作和生活场所看起来如此凌乱和混乱，如此地人性化，这对他意味着什么呢？当别人现在看着他时，他们也是这样看待他的吗？

“Why are you here anyway?” he asked, forcing himself to focus on the now. Thinking could come later, when he wasn’t flanked by two angels. “I finished my stint with the Antichrist already.”  
“你到底为什么在这里？”他问道，强迫自己专注于眼前的事情。思考可以留到以后，当他不再被两位天使包围时。“我已经完成了与邪教的合作。”

Sandalphon sniggered. “Yeah. Job well done, eh, Raziel?”  
桑达尔芬嘲笑道：“是啊，做得不错，对吧，拉齐尔？”

Crowley’s lips pressed into a thin line. God, they couldn’t let it go, could they? “At least I tried.”  
克劳利的嘴唇紧紧抿成一条细线。天啊，他们就是放不下吗？"至少我尝试过。"

Gabriel held up a hand to silence Sandalphon. “And you did _very_ well,” he said, managing to roll up consolation and patronising in one charming bundle. “That’s why we stopped by: to get an update on his status.”  
加百列举起手示意桑达尔芬安静下来。“你做得很好，”他说着，巧妙地将安慰和傲慢融为一体。“这就是我们来的原因：想要了解他的最新情况。”

Crowley’s stomach dropped. “Status?” he echoed. “I mean, you know I left my post? I– it was in my last report. A few days before his birthday?”  
克劳利的胃一沉。“情况如何？”他重复道。“我的意思是，你知道我离开了我的岗位吗？我——这在我的最后一份报告中提到过。就在他生日前几天？”

“Oh, yeah, yeah.” Gabriel waved his words away. “We know all about that. There’s a lot happening. All good.”  
“哦，是的，是的。”加布里埃尔挥了挥手，“我们都知道这些。发生了很多事情。一切都好。”

Crowley opened and shut his mouth a couple of times, trying to find a good way to ask how imminent war could, in any way, be considered _good_. In the end, he resorted to, “_All_ good?”  
克劳利张开嘴巴，又合上了几次，试图找到一个好的方式来询问如何能够将即将到来的战争视为好事。最后，他只好问道：“一切都好吗？”

“Well, all going according to the divine plan,” Gabriel said cheerfully. “The Hellhound has been set loose and now the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are being summoned: Death, Pollution, Famine, War…”  
“嗯，一切都按照神的计划进行着。”加百列愉快地说道。“地狱猎犬已经释放，现在四骑士正在被召唤：死亡、污染、饥荒、战争……”

Words from Revelations sprang to mind and Crowley had to force himself not to react. Or, at least react in an appropriate way that didn’t involve screaming. “Um. Yeah. So… who summons them?”  
心中涌起启示录的话语，克劳利不得不强迫自己不要有任何反应。或者，至少以一种不涉及尖叫的适当方式做出反应。“嗯，是的。那么...是谁召唤它们呢？”

Gabriel shrugged. “Not my department,” he said. “I believe we outsource that sort of thing.”  
加布里埃尔耸了耸肩。“不是我的部门，”他说。“我相信我们外包那种事情。”

“About time,” Sandalphon put in. “That’s what I say.”  
“早该这样了。”桑达尔芬插话道。“我就是这么说的。”

Of course you bloody do, Crowley thought wearily.  
克劳利厌倦地想道：“当然你该死地明白。”

“You can’t,” the angel continued, “have a war without War.”  
“你不能没有战争而发动战争。”天使继续说道。

Crowley turned very slowly to look at the angel.  
克劳利缓慢地转过身来，看着天使。

“Sandalphon, that is very good!” Gabriel exclaimed delightedly and Lord, Crowley wished the ground would just open up and swallow him already. These angels were meant to be the best Heaven could provide and yet. “You can’t have a war without _War_? I might use that!” Gabriel laughed, then clapped his hands together in front of him. “Anyway, how was the Hellhound?”  
“桑达尔芬，太好了！”加百列高兴地大叫道，而克劳利则希望地面能够裂开把他吞下去。这些天使本应是天堂最优秀的代表，然而……“没有战争，怎么能打仗呢？我可能会用上这个！”加百列笑着说道，然后双手鼓掌。“话说回来，地狱猎犬怎么样了？”

“I… ah… didn’t stay to see it,” Crowley lied, fingers digging into his palms.  
“我...啊...没等着看。”克劳利撒谎道，手指紧紧插入掌心。

“Ah, well.” Gabriel spread his hands. “Can’t really blame you there.” He glanced at Sandalphon, then chuckled again as if he’d heard the best joke in the universe. “Can’t have a war without War… clever.”  
“啊，好吧。”加百列伸开双手。“你那样做也不能怪你。”他瞥了一眼桑达尔芬，然后再次笑了起来，仿佛听到了宇宙中最好笑的笑话。“没有战争怎么能没有战争…聪明。”

Sandalphon snickered, as if somehow he had won the stakes in a game Crowley had no idea they were playing.  
桑达尔芬嘿嘿笑了起来，仿佛他以某种方式赢得了克劳利毫不知情的赌局。

Gabriel cleared his throat pointedly, looking from Crowley to the door and back.  
加百利有意地清了清嗓子，从克劳利看向门，然后又回过头来。

“Oh! Right!” Crowley pulled the door open. “Yeah. Sorry.” He stepped back to let them pass, his heart still thundering, then closed the door behind them both. And, because God, he needed do _something_ to make himself feel better, he let a temptation slip out.  
“哦！对了！”克劳利拉开门。“是的，抱歉。”他退后一步让他们通过，心脏仍然怦怦直跳，然后关上了门。因为上帝，他需要做些事情来让自己感觉好些，于是他放纵了一下诱惑。

Shrill shrieks and laughter rang out outside, accompanied by the sound of a fleet of children running for a surprise delivery of sweets. Gabriel yowled like a startled cat a split second before a satisfyingly wet squelch.  
外面传来尖锐的尖叫声和笑声，伴随着一群孩子奔跑的声音，他们正为了一份意外送来的糖果而兴奋不已。加布里埃尔在一瞬间发出了像被吓到的猫一样的尖叫声，然后是令人满意的湿漉漉的咯吱声。

Crowley counted to three before opening the door and stepping out, worry all over his face, which meant he didn’t laugh when he saw Sandalphon helping Gabriel up from the ground, his pristine coat no longer so pristine.  
克劳利数到三，然后打开门走了出去，脸上满是担忧。他看到桑达尔芬正帮助加百列从地上站起来，他那件原本洁白无瑕的外套已经不再如此。

“Oh no!” Crowley cried. “I’m sorry. Humans. You know what they’re like.”  
“哦不！”克劳利大叫道。“对不起。人类啊，你知道他们是什么样子的。”

Gabriel gave him a tight-lipped smile. “Not for long,” he said, dismissing the dirt with a flick of his hands. He nodded to Sandalphon and they stepped away, vanishing before their feet even left the ground.  
加布里埃尔勉强笑了笑。“不会太久的，”他说着，用手一甩，将泥土抛开。他向桑达尔芬点了点头，他们迅速离开，甚至在脚离开地面之前就消失了。

Crowley sagged against the door, breathing hard. Right. Okay. He had to focus. Things were going well and according to the plan and that wasn’t good. There had to be something, some way around it, something they’d missed.  
克劳利靠在门上，喘着粗气。对，没错。好的。他必须集中注意力。事情进行得很顺利，按计划进行，这并不好。一定有什么办法，绕过去的办法，他们肯定漏掉了什么。

“Uncle Tony!” “托尼叔叔！”

He straightened up from the door, pressing a smile onto his face. “Coming!” he called. First things first, finish what he needed to. Maybe, he thought, the idea would come to him while he worked. God, he hoped so.  
他从门口站直了起来，强忍着笑容说道：“来了！”首先，他要完成手头的事情。或许，他想着，灵感会在工作中涌现出来。天啊，他希望如此。

Aziraphale rubbed his eyes with forefinger and thumb as he waited.  
亚齐拉费尔等待时，用食指和拇指揉了揉眼睛。

It had not been a good night. He and Crowley had spent much of it trying their best to drown what was left of their consciousness and arguing about what the hell they were meant to do about the apparently impending Armageddon. Doing it while drunk was probably not the best of ideas, although it did lead to some very innovative – albeit ultimately useless – suggestions.  
那晚并不愉快。他和克劳利大部分时间都在努力淹没他们剩下的意识，并为即将到来的世界末日争论着该怎么办。喝醉了再讨论这个问题可能不是最好的主意，尽管这确实带来了一些非常有创意但最终毫无用处的建议。

Now, his head was clear, but he was in dire need of his morning coffee fix.  
现在，他的头脑清醒了，但他迫切需要早晨的咖啡来提神。

Thankfully, the baristas at his favourite little hole-in-the-wall hipster coffee shop knew him on sight and had started working on his order as soon as he walked in the door without him having to say a word.  
幸运的是，他最喜欢的那家小角落的嬉皮士咖啡店的咖啡师们一眼就认出了他，他一走进门他们就开始准备他的订单，而他根本不用说一句话。

He leaned forward on the couch and reached out for the chocolate muffin on the plate in front of him. Usually, pastries were the preferred choice before ten, but if the apocalypse was indeed coming, then why waste a moment?  
他向前倾身坐在沙发上，伸手去拿放在他面前盘子上的巧克力松饼。通常，在十点之前，糕点是首选，但如果世界末日真的要来了，那为什么要浪费一刻呢？

As always, it was as perfect as he expected, rich and chocolate with tart dark chocolate chips and for a moment, he could just relax and–  
一如既往，它完美无缺，丰富的巧克力口味搭配酸甜的黑巧克力碎片，让他瞬间感到放松和愉悦

“Morning, Aziraphale. Enjoying your snack?”  
早上好，阿齐拉费尔。享受你的小吃了吗？

His mouth still full, Aziraphale raised his eyes to the wide screen TV on the wall that had – up until five seconds ago – been playing a fascinating video about weaving wicker baskets.  
嘴里还满是食物的阿齐拉费尔抬起眼睛，望向墙上的宽屏电视，此刻正播放着一个关于编织柳条篮子的迷人视频，直到五秒钟前还在播放。

“Oh ’ucking ’ell,” he groaned.  
"哦，该死的"，他抱怨道。

On the screen, Hastur was standing at the art table, Ligur at his side. The smaller, darker demon was poking at the art tools and seemed far too excited about the small craft knife he found.  
在屏幕上，哈斯特站在艺术桌旁，他的身旁是利古尔。这个较小、较黑的恶魔正在戳弄艺术工具，对他找到的小手工刀似乎过于兴奋。

Aziraphale swallowed down his muffin. “Morning, my dears. What can I do for you?”  
亚齐拉费尔咽下了他的松饼。“早上好，亲爱的。有什么我可以帮你们的吗？”

“It’s about the Antichrist,” Ligur said, turning the knife over in his hand.  
“这是关于反基督的事情。”利古尔说着，手中翻转着刀子。

“Oh, marvellous boy,” Aziraphale lied, reclining back against the couch as if he couldn’t feel his heart haring against his ribs like a startled rabbit. “Very like his father, you know. Defiant, rebellious, chaos incarnate. Quite an exciting little specimen.”  
“哦，了不起的孩子，”亚齐拉费尔撒了个谎，靠在沙发上，仿佛他感觉不到自己的心脏像受惊的兔子一样急速跳动。“非常像他的父亲，你知道的。蔑视、叛逆、混乱的化身。真是一个令人兴奋的小家伙。”

“Our operatives in the State Department have arranged for the child’s family to be flown to the Middle East,” Hastur said, as if he hadn’t spoken.  
“我们在国务院的特工已经安排好了将这个孩子的家人送往中东的航班，”哈斯特说道，仿佛他从未说过一样。

“There, he and the Hellhound will be taken to the valley of Megiddo,” Ligur added.  
“在那里，他和地狱猎犬将被带到米吉多谷，”利古尔补充道。

Well, Aziraphale thought bitterly, _someone_ was going to notice part of the equation was missing sooner rather than later. Still, he smiled and gave them as enthusiastic a thumbs-up as he could muster.  
阿齐拉费尔心里苦涩地想着，迟早会有人注意到方程中缺少了一部分。不过，他微笑着，尽力给予他们一个热情的竖起大拇指。

Hastur leaned forward, bracing his hands on the workbench. “The four Horsemen will begin their final ride. Armageddon will begin.” He grinned, baring his teeth. “The final combat. It’s what we’ve been working towards since we rebelled.” His black eyes glistened with malice. “We are the Fallen,” he intoned gravely. “Never forget that.”  
哈斯特向前倾身，双手撑在工作台上。“四骑士将开始他们最后的骑行。末日将开始。”他咧开嘴，露出牙齿。“最后的战斗。这是我们背叛以来一直努力追求的目标。”他的黑眼睛闪烁着恶意。“我们是堕落者，”他庄重地吟唱道。“永远不要忘记这一点。”

Aziraphale stared incredulously at him. “Well, it’s hardly the kind of thing one forgets, is it?” he said irritably. A snap of his fingers shut down the television and he returned to picking half-heartedly at his muffin, his appetite gone. “Anyway,” he muttered more for himself than anyone who might be listening. “I didn’t mean to fall. Is it my fault Lucifer had better catering?”  
亚齐拉费尔怀疑地盯着他。“嗯，这可不是那种容易忘记的事情，是吧？”他不耐烦地说道。他用手指一弹，电视立刻关闭，然后他心不在焉地玩弄着松饼，胃口全无。“不管怎样，”他喃喃自语，更像是对自己说的话，而不是对任何可能在听的人。“我并不是故意摔倒的。难道是我的错，路西法提供的餐点更好吗？”

The muffin had been reduced to a forlorn pile of crumbs and chips by the time the waitress brought his coffee over. As soon as she was out of sight, he miracled it into an insulated mug and headed for the door, away from the televisions and radios and other communicable devices.  
当女服务员把咖啡端过来的时候，松饼已经变成了一堆凄凉的碎屑和碎片。她一离开视线，他就把它变成了一个保温杯，然后朝着门口走去，远离电视、收音机和其他传染性设备。

_Easy job_, he thought bitterly to himself as he stalked back through the streets of Soho, the crowds parting before him like the Red Sea. _Deliver the Antichrist and keep an eye on him. A job even the most imbecilic of demons should have managed._  
他心里苦涩地想着，这真是个轻松的工作。他在苏豪街道上急行而过，人群在他面前分开，就像红海一样。交付那个反基督并时刻保持警惕，这本应是连最愚蠢的恶魔都能完成的任务。 

His shop provided a blessed respite from the chaos of the city outside.  
他的店铺为外面城市的混乱提供了一个宁静的避风港。

Aziraphale had spent a great deal of time making the shop into both haven and home. The shelves were tightly-packed with all manner of books, some of very doubtful providence, many of definite dark origins and one or two downright toxic. He was especially proud of his broad and extensive collection of pornography in all its wonderful forms. Some of his etchings were worth a small fortune to a particular niche of collectors.  
亚齐拉费尔花了很多时间将这家书店打造成了一个避风港和家园。书架上密密麻麻地摆满了各种各样的书籍，其中有些来源可疑，许多来自黑暗的渊源，还有一两本简直是有毒的。他对自己广泛而丰富的色情作品收藏尤为自豪。他的一些蚀刻作品对于某些特定收藏家来说价值连城。

A rather interesting statue took pride of place on a table in the middle of the floor. One might consider it two angels doing battle, good versus evil, but given the general theme of many of the items in the shop and the fact that both angels appeared to be nude, it suggested wrestling was not quite the activity they were engaged in.    
一尊相当有趣的雕像占据了地板中央的桌子上的骄傲位置。有人可能会认为这是两个天使在进行战斗，善与恶的对抗，但考虑到商店中许多物品的整体主题以及两个天使都赤身裸体的事实，这暗示着他们所从事的活动并不完全是摔跤。

Not, of course, that many – if any – customers were ever given the opportunity to see any of his collection.  
当然，并不是说很多（如果有的话）顾客有机会看到他的任何一件收藏品。

The few people who managed to enter during his rare opening hours found their senses assaulted by alluring scents, graphic carnal imagery, explicit ornaments and the unmistakable sound of several people being enthusiastically inspired by the books somewhere in the shelves. Most of them either fled in shame or retreated, roiling with mortified lust, as soon as the helpful, friendly shopkeeper appeared from the back of the shop, apparently oblivious to the goings-on.  
在他难得开放的时间里，少数成功进入的人们发现他们的感官受到了诱人的香气、生动的肉体意象、明显的装饰品和书架某处传来的几个人热情地受到书籍启发的声音的冲击。大部分人要么羞愧地逃离，要么退缩，心中充满了羞愧的欲望，只要乐于助人、友好的店主从店后出现，对所发生的事情显然毫不知情。

Still, once in a while, a group of excitable people from the Internet would try and visit after hearing about his legendary and obscene collection. They always went away disappointed when they found the shop only seemed to sell childrens’ books.  
然而，偶尔还是会有一群来自互联网的兴奋的人们听说了他传说中的淫秽收藏后，试图前来参观。然而当他们发现这家店似乎只卖儿童书时，他们总是失望而归。

He shed his overcoat and sank into his large, comfortable armchair, brooding over his coffee.  
他脱下外套，沉入他宽大舒适的扶手椅中，一边喝着咖啡，一边陷入沉思。

The Antichrist was abroad somewhere on earth, but finding him would be downright impossible. A creature like that would naturally have the kind of camouflage that would protect him from harm. It would render him all but invisible to anyone who had ill-intentions and he had to admit at this point, finding the child and shoving him down a manhole eleven years late seemed like a bloody good idea.  
反基督者在地球上某个地方，但要找到他几乎是不可能的。像他这样的生物自然会有一种伪装，以保护自己免受伤害。这会使他对那些心怀不轨的人几乎看不见，他不得不承认，现在找到那个孩子，把他推进一个人孔里，虽然晚了十一年，但听起来真是个好主意。

He had no idea how long he’d been sitting there, though his coffee was lukewarm in the cup, when the telephone rang.  
他不知道自己坐在那里多久了，尽管杯子里的咖啡已经变得微温，这时电话响了。

Aziraphale had few visitors. He had fewer phonecalls.  
亚齐拉费尔很少有访客。他接到的电话更少。

Only one person usually called and, given the circumstances, it only made sense for it to be the angel, which was why he answered it.  
通常只有一个人会打电话，考虑到情况，只有天使打电话才有意义，所以他接了电话。

Much to his abject astonishment, it was a customer with a genuine inquiry. He was so startled that he forgot to use his usual manners and was _actually_ polite. Well, for a given degree of polite, right up until the… pleasant fellow on the other end of the line decided Aziraphale was lying about the availability of yet another non-existent book of prophecy.  
令他极度惊讶的是，这是一个真正有问题的顾客。他如此吃惊以至于忘记了使用他通常的礼貌，实际上变得很有礼貌。嗯，就某种程度而言是有礼貌的，直到电话另一端的那个友善的人认定亚齐拉费尔在撒谎，说有另一本不存在的预言书。

“Ah,” Aziraphale said, slowly smiling. “I’m afraid you’re asking the impossible.”  
“啊，”亚齐拉费尔慢慢地笑着说道。“恐怕你在问一个不可能的事情。”

The man made a very intriguing and obscene suggestion.  
这个男人提出了一个非常有趣而下流的建议。

“Believe me, darling, if I could do that to myself, I would,” he sighed wistfully. “Alas, I must go without the greatest of pleasures.”  
“相信我，亲爱的，如果我能这样做，我会的。”他叹息着说道，“唉，我必须放弃最大的享受了。”

There was a shocked silence, then some more specific insults.  
一片震惊的寂静，随后是更具体的侮辱。

Aziraphale stared at the ceiling, idly waiting, coiling the telephone line around his finger. “Actually,” he said, once the man had vented his spleen about perverts and displayed his full collection of fairly outdated terms. “I think I _might_ have a copy of that book after all, but I don’t sell to bigoted idiots.” He smiled and added as sweetly as he could, “Have a _fabulous_ day.”  
亚齐拉费尔盯着天花板发呆，无聊地等待着，将电话线缠绕在手指上。“实际上，”他说道，当那个男人发泄完他的怒气，展示出他那些相当过时的词汇时。“我想我可能确实有那本书的副本，但我不卖给偏执的白痴。”他微笑着尽可能甜美地补充道：“祝你有个美好的一天。”

The phone had barely touched the cradled when it started jangling again.  
手机刚刚放在座机上，就又开始大声响起来。

Aziraphale barely even needed to lift the receiver to recognise the same voice, swearing and frothing even more than before.  
亚齐拉费尔几乎不需要抬起话筒就能辨认出那个声音，比以前更加咒骂和激动。

On any other day, the level of wrath and envy might have warmed him, but he had far more significant things to worry about that some little idiot with a temper.  
在任何其他日子里，愤怒和嫉妒的程度可能会让他感到温暖，但他有更重要的事情要担心，而不是一些脾气暴躁的小白痴。

After the fourth hostile snarling call, he snatched up the receiver. “For Satan’s sake, if you call this number again I will reach down the line and rip your tongue out!”  
在第四次敌对的咆哮电话之后，他抓起了电话听筒。“见鬼，如果你再打这个号码，我会伸手进线路把你的舌头扯出来！”

“Oh for Heaven’s sake, Aziraphale!”  
哎呀，阿齐拉费尔！

The demon blinked stupidly. “Oh. Er. Morning, my dear.”  
恶魔愚蠢地眨了眨眼睛。“哦。嗯。早上好，亲爱的。”

“Hm.” He could picture the twitch of amusement on the angel’s lips. “Annoying callers again?”  
“嗯。”他能想象出天使嘴角的一丝嘲笑。“又是烦人的电话吗？”

“A customer actually,” Aziraphale said tartly. “Or someone who wanted to be a customer, but he was so very rude.”  
“一个顾客，实际上，”亚齐拉费尔尖刻地说道。“或者说是一个想成为顾客的人，但他非常无礼。”

“Like calls to like,” Crowley said a bit too quickly and Aziraphale had to stifle a snort of mirth. The angel tried to insist he was all sweetness and light, but the best kind of sweetness came with a little bit of sharpness and when Crowley was in the right mood, he could give lip with the best of them.  
“似物相吸。”克劳利有些急促地说道，阿齐拉费尔不禁忍住了一声咯咯笑。天使试图坚称自己是甜美和光明的化身，但最好的甜美总是伴随着一点锋芒，当克劳利心情恰到好处时，他能和最厉害的人一样嘴利。

“Cheeky,” he warned happily. “So what are you calling for, my dear?”  
“调皮鬼，”他开心地警告道。“那么，亲爱的，你找我有什么事？”

The angel exhaled sharply. “Look, I know this is a stupid question, but do you think there’s any chance there was more than one baby at the hospital that night?”  
天使猛地吐了口气。“听着，我知道这是个愚蠢的问题，但你觉得那天晚上医院里可能有不止一个婴儿吗？”

Aziraphale stared at his reflection in dismay, remembering a man with a pipe and a pullover who seemed so very out of place. “Oh. Shit.”  
亚齐拉费尔沮丧地盯着自己的倒影，回忆起那个戴着烟斗、穿着套头衫的男人，他似乎格外不合时宜。“哦，该死。”

### Chapter Text 章节正文

The Bentley slid through the London traffic like a fish in a shoal.  
宾利轿车在伦敦的交通中像鱼群中的一条鱼一样滑行。

“And then I got the twins mixed up again,” Crowley said with a sheepish chuckle, “which _should_ be impossible, because…” He took a hand from the steering wheel to wave vaguely at himself. “You know. Should be able to tell. But if _I_ can get two humans mixed up, who’s to say that humans wouldn’t make the same mistake? I mean, you hear about it all the time. Swapped at birth and things like that. And babies are kind of interchangeable when they’re tiny.”  
“然后我又把双胞胎搞混了，”克劳利尴尬地笑着说，“这应该是不可能的，因为……”他从方向盘上抽出一只手，对自己随意挥了挥。“你知道的。应该能分辨出来。但如果我能把两个人类搞混，谁又能说人类不会犯同样的错误呢？我是说，这种事情你总是听说的。被调包的婴儿之类的。而且当他们还很小的时候，婴儿们有点可以互换。”

“Mm. Quite.” 嗯，相当的。

Crowley shot a look at the demon in his passenger seat. The poor bugger was already green and they weren’t even outside the city limits yet. “There’s a bottle of water in the foot well,” he said, then groped in the pocket of his leather jacket and pulled out a tin of sweets. “And I remember these helped last time.”  
克劳利瞥了一眼坐在副驾驶座位上的恶魔。可怜的家伙脸色已经发青，他们还没离开城市范围呢。“脚下有瓶水，”他说着，然后在皮夹克口袋里摸出一罐糖。“我记得上次这些对你有帮助。”

Aziraphale nodded gratefully, taking the tin of boiled sweets. “You think I would get used to it, wouldn’t you? The number of times I’ve been here?” He shot a malevolent look at the dashboard. “I don’t have half as much trouble in any other car.”  
亚齐拉费尔感激地点了点头，接过了一罐煮糖果。“你会觉得我早就习惯了，不是吗？我来过这里多少次了？”他恶意地瞪了一眼仪表盘。“在其他车里我可没遇到这么多麻烦。”

Crowley gave him a patient look. “It’s because the suspension is different,” he said. “The car isn’t doing it on purpose.”  
克劳利耐心地看着他。“这是因为悬挂系统不同，”他说。“车子并不是故意这样做的。”

“Hm.” Aziraphale sucked gloomily on a sweet. “So we need to go back to the hospital, I assume? Have a dig through the records for any other child born that night?”  
“嗯。”亚齐拉费尔郁闷地吮吸着一颗糖果。“那我们需要回医院，我猜是吧？查找那天晚上出生的其他孩子的记录？”

Crowley nodded. “It’s the only thing I could think of.”  
克劳利点了点头。“这是我能想到的唯一办法。”

The demon groped down beneath his seat for the bottle of water. “You might want to put your foot down,” he said as he cracked the seal. “We are on a bit of a tight deadline.”  
恶魔在座位下摸索着找到了一瓶水。“你可能想要加快速度，”他打开瓶盖说道。“我们有点赶时间。”

Crowley shot a scandalised glare at him. “I’m _not_ breaking the speed limit, not in the middle of the city. We’ll be there in plenty of time.”  
克劳利气愤地瞪了他一眼。“我没有超速，更不会在城市中间超速。我们会提前到达的。”

The demon glowered, sinking lower in the seat. “Sooner we get there, the sooner I can get out of this bastarding car.”  
恶魔怒视着，身子沉入座位。“我们越快到那里，我就越快能离开这该死的车。”

Crowley knew the Bentley could be a little… temperamental at times, but that was what came of having a vintage car. They had… personality, which was one of the things that had drawn him to it in the first place.  
克劳利知道那辆宾利有时可能有点...喜怒无常，但这就是拥有一辆老爷车的结果。它们有着独特的个性，这也是最初吸引他的原因之一。

Still he couldn’t help wondering if Aziraphale was right about the car doing it all on purpose when the stereo switched itself on and started playing _Headlong_. Only, it started in the middle of a line:  
他仍然忍不住想知道，如果阿齐拉费尔说的对，汽车是否故意这样做，当音响自动打开并开始播放《Headlong》时。只是，它从一句歌词的中间开始播放：

_And there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can  
而且你什么都做不了，什么都做不了  
Nothin' you can do about it.  
没什么你能做的。_

Aziraphale gestured emphatically at the stereo, a look of outrage on his face.  
亚齐拉费尔气愤地指着音响，脸上露出愤怒的表情。

Crowley bit his lip to keep himself from grinning and reached over and switched it off. “Coincidence,” he said.🔄  ❓  
克劳利咬住嘴唇，不让自己笑出声来，伸手关掉了它。“巧合而已。”他说道。

The demon snorted and glowered out of the window.  
恶魔哼了一声，怒视着窗外。

Thankfully, by the time they reached the winding Oxfordshire roads, Aziraphale was looking and sounding much better. He even sat up to peer around, searching the surrounding area.  
幸运的是，当他们抵达蜿蜒的牛津郡道路时，亚齐拉费尔看起来和听起来都好多了。他甚至坐起来四处张望，搜索周围的地区。

“It’s definitely around here,” he said. “Not too far from the airbase.”  
他说：“肯定就在这附近，离空军基地也不远。”

Crowley blinked in surprise and looked at him. “There’s an airbase in Oxford?”  
克劳利惊讶地眨了眨眼，看着他说道：“牛津有一个空军基地？”

Aziraphale nodded distractedly. “American air force or some such. Somewhere a charming ambassador’s wife could find herself unexpectedly in labour. What a shame their facilities don’t provide natal care, but oh, there’s a convent-turned-maternity hospital nearby. Nice and neat, don’t you think?”  
亚齐拉费尔心不在焉地点了点头。“美国空军或类似的机构。某个地方，一个迷人的大使夫人可能会意外陷入分娩。可惜他们的设施没有提供产科护理，但噢，附近有一家改建成产科医院的修道院。漂亮整洁，你觉得呢？”

“Mm.” Crowley’s lips twitched. “So well-coordinated.”  
“嗯。”克劳利的嘴角微微扬起。“如此默契。”

“Oh, do shut up,” Aziraphale grumbled.  
“哦，闭嘴吧，”阿齐拉费尔咕哝道。

“Just saying,” Crowley said innocently, “Evil begets evil. Reaping what you sow and all that.”  
“只是说说而已，”克劳利无辜地说道，“恶有恶报。种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆。”

“Or,” Aziraphale countered with a sniff, “humans are just stupid.”  
“或者，”阿齐拉费尔嗤之以鼻地反驳道，“人类就是愚蠢的。”

“Oh yeah.” Crowley nodded, deliberately keeping his eyes and barely suppressed smile facing forward. “Definitely _just_ the humans. Mm-hm. No one else.”  
“哦，是的。”克劳利点了点头，故意保持着眼神和勉强压抑住的微笑朝前方。“绝对只是人类。嗯嗯，没有其他人。”

“Ah!” Aziraphale grabbed his wrist and pointed up ahead. “There!” His fingers tightened briefly, his hand warm and surprisingly soft. “And who’s the more foolish, my dear? The fool, or the fool who follows him?”  
“啊！”亚齐拉费尔抓住他的手腕，指着前方。“就在那里！”他的手指稍稍用力，手掌温暖而出奇地柔软。“亲爱的，谁更愚蠢呢？是那个傻瓜，还是跟随他的傻瓜？”

Crowley grinned. “Well, they were _your_ nuns, weren’t they?”  
克劳利咧嘴笑了笑。“嘿，那些修女可是你的人，不是吗？”

The demon opened and shut his mouth indignantly, but Crowley could seem the gleam of satisfaction in his eyes. “You really are on a roll today, aren’t you, angel?”  
恶魔愤怒地张开又闭上嘴巴，但克劳利能看到他眼中的满足闪光。“你今天真是运气不错，天使。”

Crowley thought back to Gabriel and his beautiful and mud-spattered coat. “Bit of a morning,” he admitted, taking the demon’s direction.  
克劳利回想起加百利和他那件美丽而沾满泥污的外套。“有点儿早上啊，”他承认道，按照恶魔的指示行动。

It took them another fifteen minutes of windy roads and stretches of forest to reach the building that might have looked like a convent once, but now had walls of camouflage netting and barrels stacked in the main courtyard.  
他们又花了十五分钟走过弯弯曲曲的道路和一片片的森林，才到达那座曾经可能像修道院一样的建筑物，但现在却有伪装网墙和主庭院里堆放着的桶。

“Odd,” Aziraphale voiced his thought for him.  
“奇怪，”阿齐拉费尔替他说出了他的想法。

Crowley climbed out of the car. “Are you sure this is–” A pulse like a heartbeat throbbed over him as he set foot on the ground and he swayed, catching his hand on the Bentley’s roof. “Oh…”  
克劳利从车里爬了出来。“你确定这是……”当他踏上地面时，一股像心跳般的脉冲在他身上悸动，他摇摇晃晃地，抓住宾利车顶。“哦……”

“What is it?” Aziraphale was around the car and by his side in a blink. “Are you all right?”  
“怎么了？”亚齐拉费尔转眼间就来到了车旁。“你没事吧？”

Crowley stared around, unable to keep himself from smiling. “Oh, yeah. This place… someone _really_ loves this place.”  
克劳利四处张望，忍不住笑了起来。“哦，是的。这个地方...有人真的很喜欢这个地方。”

Aziraphale gave the junkyard of the courtyard a doubtful look. “Are you sure?”  
亚齐拉费尔对庭院里的垃圾场投以怀疑的目光。“你确定吗？”

“Mm.” Angelic senses were always good when it came to the positive emotions and now, it was washing over him like the tide rolling in. “It’s… weird. Good weird, but…” He shook his head with a laugh. “Okay, okay. Can’t get distracted.”  
“嗯。”天使的感知力对于积极的情绪总是很敏锐，现在它像潮水般涌上他心头。“这感觉……有点奇怪。但是是好奇怪。”他笑着摇了摇头。“好了，好了。不能分心。”

The demon was clearly keeping a careful eye on him as they entered the grounds. “Are you sure you’re all right, my dear?”  
恶魔明显地在他们进入场地时紧紧盯着他。“亲爱的，你确定没事吗？”

“I’m f–” Getting shot in the chest will distract you and he staggered back with a yelp, clutching both hands to his chest. Bright blue liquid dripped between his fingers and he stared down at it in astonishment. “What the Hell…?”  
“我...” 被子弹击中胸口会让你分心，他发出一声惨叫，踉跄后退，双手抱住胸口。明亮的蓝色液体从他的手指间滴落，他惊讶地低头看着。“到底是怎么回事...？”

Aziraphale indignantly smudged a dark smear of red off his cream shirt. “Paint?”  
亚齐拉费尔愤怒地在他的奶油色衬衫上擦去一道深红色的污渍。“油漆？”

Crowley lowered his hands with a groan. His t-shirt was a mess.  
克劳利沮丧地放下双手。他的T恤衫一片狼藉。

“Hey!” He looked up to see a man in overalls and a helmet rushing towards them. Whoever he was, he didn’t seem happy. “You’ve been hit! You–”  
“嘿！”他抬头看到一个穿着工作服和头盔的男人朝他们冲过来。不管他是谁，看起来他并不开心。“你被打中了！你——”

The man was suddenly obscured as Aziraphale stepped between him and Crowley, a low, primal growl ripping through the demon’s chest. Crowley peered over his shoulder in time to see the man go grey and keel over, eyes rolling. No doubt, he had seen something terrifying as well.  
当亚齐拉费尔挡在他和克劳利之间时，那个男人突然被遮住了，一声低沉而原始的咆哮从恶魔的胸腔中爆发出来。克劳利及时地从肩膀上往后看，只见那个男人变得苍白并倒下，眼珠滚动。毫无疑问，他也看到了什么可怕的东西。

“Did you _have_ to?” he said, swatting Aziraphale’s arm.  
“你非得这样做吗？”他说着，拍打着亚齐拉费尔的手臂。

Aziraphale swung around with a beaming smile. “And let him think he can get away with shooting you, my dear?” He shook his head, tutting. “No, no. That won’t do at _all_.” He took Crowley by the shoulders, looking him up and down. “Well, that’s quite the mess, isn’t it?”  
亚齐拉费尔转身露出灿烂的笑容。“让他觉得他可以逃脱击中你，亲爱的？”他摇了摇头，嘴里嘟囔着。“不，不行。这样可不行。”他抓住克劳利的肩膀，上下打量着他。“哎呀，这可真是一团糟啊。”

Crowley rubbed at the paint on his fingers. “Yeah. And it’s one of my favourite t-shirts as well.”  
克劳利用手指擦拭着手上的油漆。“是的，这也是我最喜欢的一件T恤。”

The demon gave him a sunny smile. “I know.” He leaned closer and blew a puff of warm, sulphur-scented air against the paint, which vaporised in a wisp of blue. He drew back, beaming. “There. Much better, isn’t it?”  
恶魔给了他一个阳光般的微笑。“我知道。”他靠近一点，对着油漆吹了一口温暖、硫磺味的气息，油漆在一阵蓝色的雾气中蒸发了。他退后一步，笑容满面地说道：“看，好多了吧？”

Crowley fought down a smile. “You soft bugger.”  
克劳利强忍住笑容。“你这个软蛋。”

“Soft?” Aziraphale wrinkled his nose. “I think you mistake vanity for something else. I can hardly be seen wandering about with a paint-spattered hobo.” He spun about on his heel. “Shall we go and find some nuns?”  
“软弱？”亚齐拉费尔皱了皱鼻子。“我觉得你把虚荣当成了别的什么。我可不想被人看到和一个沾满油漆的流浪汉一起闲逛。”他转身转了个圈。“我们去找些修女吧？”

Crowley hurried after him, glancing around. The place looked like a combat training centre, but judging by the overall-man’s clothing, it was purely recreational. Paint spattered every surface, from a shell of a car to the upturned oil drums.  
克劳利匆忙跟在他后面，四处扫视。这个地方看起来像一个战斗训练中心，但从那个整体男人的服装来看，这纯粹是娱乐性质的。油漆溅满了每一个表面，从一辆废弃的汽车到翻倒的油桶。

“I don’t think there are nuns here anymore,” he said when he caught up with the demon inside the halls.  
当他追上了大厅里的恶魔时，他说：“我觉得这里已经没有尼姑了。”

“Certainly looks that way,” Aziraphale agreed, frowning. He opened a door only for another human – armed with yet another paintball gun – to crash straight into him. Crowley winced on his behalf, praying the demon wouldn’t take it personally.  
“看起来确实是这样，”阿齐拉费尔皱着眉头表示同意。他打开一扇门，结果却撞上了另一个人——手持着另一支彩弹枪的人。克劳利为他感到痛苦，祈祷这个恶魔不会把这件事当作个人攻击。

She gave him a worried look. “Are we finished already?”  
她用担忧的眼神看着他。“我们已经结束了吗？”

“Oh,” Aziraphale purred and Crowley turned to him in alarm, recognising that tone. “I think you’re only just getting started.” He snapped both fingers up and it was echoed by the sharper crack of genuine gunfire.  
“哦，”阿齐拉费尔轻声说道，克劳利警觉地转向他，辨认出那种语气。“我觉得你才刚刚开始。”他抬起两根手指，随即响起了真实枪声的尖锐爆裂声。

“Aziraphale!” Crowley grabbed his arm. “What the Hell?”  
“亚齐拉费尔！”克劳利抓住他的胳膊。“到底怎么回事？”

Wide blue eyes looked at him. “My dear?”  
宽阔的蓝眼睛注视着他。“亲爱的？”

Crowley gestured to the window and the sound of battle going on outside. “Don’t you ‘my dear’ me! What did you do?”  
克劳利指了指窗外正在进行的战斗声。“别叫我‘亲爱的’！你做了什么？”

The demon shrugged as if he had done nothing more than leave the toilet seat up. “A lesson in the value of mortality?”  
恶魔耸了耸肩，仿佛他只是忘记放下马桶盖一样。“对人类生命的价值有所领悟？”

Crowley’s mouth dropped open.  
克劳利的嘴巴张大了。

“Come along, my dear,” Aziraphale continued, trotting happily off along the hall.  
“来吧，亲爱的”，亚齐拉费尔高兴地沿着走廊快步走去。

Crowley stared out of the window, then rushed after him. “You can’t just… _do_ that! They think they’re playing a game!”  
克劳利望着窗外，然后追了上去。“你不能就这样...那些人以为他们在玩游戏！”

“Aren’t we all?” The demon swung a door open and peered inside, then turned back around and found himself nose-to-nose with a glaring angel. He blinked a couple of time and Crowley slowly and pointedly crossed his arms over his chest. “Oh come now, my dear…” Crowley added a furrow of his brow and Aziraphale groaned, “Oh, stop being so dramatic! They’re still playing a game! Narrow escapes and lots of noise, but not much else.”  
“我们不都是吗？”恶魔打开一扇门，往里面瞧了瞧，然后转过身，发现自己与一个怒视的天使鼻子贴鼻子。他眨了几下眼睛，克劳利慢慢地双臂交叉在胸前，有意无意地加重了眉头的皱纹。“哦，亲爱的，别这样……”克劳利说着，阿齐拉费尔叹了口气，“哦，别这么夸张了！他们只是在玩游戏！逃脱险境，制造噪音，除此之外没什么了不起的。”

Crowley almost sagged with the relief. “Really?”  
克劳利几乎松了一口气。“真的吗？”

“Mm.” The demon’s lips gave an irrepressible twitch. “What’s the fun otherwise?”  
“嗯。”恶魔的嘴唇不由自主地抽动了一下。“不然有什么意思呢？”

The angel laughed. “Damn it, Aziraphale…” He shook his head, grinning. “I forget how nice you can b–”  
天使笑了起来。“该死的，阿齐拉费尔……”他摇了摇头，咧嘴一笑。“我忘记你可以这么友好了。”

At once, he was caught by the front of his jacket and yanked off his feet, his face unbearably close to the demon’s. “Oh you think I’m _nice_ do you, my darling?”  Aziraphale’s voice was that wicked purring growl he used at the pinnacle of his temptations and Crowley couldn’t help but staring into those ice-blue eyes. They still had those brilliant flecks he remembered from their first encounter, like sparks of lightning. “I could take you _apart_ if I–”  
他立刻被夹克前襟抓住，被猛地拽起，脸贴得离那个恶魔近得难以忍受。“哦，你觉得我很好，亲爱的？”亚齐拉费尔的声音带着那种邪恶的咕噜声，他在引诱的顶峰时常常使用这种声音，克劳利不禁盯着那双冰蓝色的眼睛。它们仍然有他们初次相遇时记忆中的那些闪光点，就像闪电的火花。“如果我愿意，我可以把你撕成碎片……”

“Ahem?” “啊咳？”

Both of them turned to see a striking black woman in a suit striding towards them.  
他们俩转过身，看到一位穿着西装的引人注目的黑人女性朝他们走来。

“Gentlemen, we ask that PDAs are kept to th–” Her eyes widened. “Saints and demons preserve us!”  
“先生们，请保持手机等电子设备的音量–” 她的眼睛瞪大了。“圣人和恶魔保佑我们！”

“You!” Aziraphale’s voice was a rumble.  
“你！”亚齐拉费尔的声音如雷霆般响起。

“M-Master Aziraphale!” “阿兹拉菲尔大师！”

Crowley found himself dangling from Aziraphale’s remaining upraised hand, as the demon snapped his fingers, freezing the woman on the spot. Crowley cleared his throat, then tapped Aziraphale pointedly on the arm.  
克劳利发现自己悬挂在亚齐拉费尔剩下的高举手上，恶魔咔嗒一声响指，将那个女人定在原地。克劳利清了清嗓子，然后有意无意地在亚齐拉费尔的手臂上轻轻敲了敲。

“Yes, yes, I know,” the demon grumbled, rolling his eyes as he walked towards her. “Talk to them, Aziraphale. They can communicate, Aziraphale. They’re not just puppets to be frozen at will, Aziraphale.”  
“是的，是的，我知道，”恶魔嘟囔着，翻了个白眼，朝她走去。“和他们交谈，亚齐拉费尔。他们可以沟通，亚齐拉费尔。他们不只是可以任意冻结的木偶，亚齐拉费尔。”

Crowley waited patiently until the demon looked up at him. “I meant you can put me down, Aziraphale,” he said, lips twitching.  
克劳利耐心地等待着，直到恶魔抬起头看着他。“我是说你可以把我放下来，阿齐拉费尔。”他说着，嘴角微微扬起。

Aziraphale blinked at him, then down at Crowley’s feet which were dangling a foot above the floor. “Oh!” He set the angel down gently. “Sorry, my dear. Got a little carried away.” He fastidiously adjusted Crowley’s jacket and tugged the end of his t-shirt so it was lying more smoothly. “There we go.”  
亚齐拉费尔瞪大眼睛看着他，然后低头看着克劳利的脚，悬在离地面一英尺的地方。“哦！”他轻轻地把天使放下。“对不起，亲爱的。有点过头了。”他细心地整理了克劳利的夹克，拉了拉他的T恤，使其更平整。“好了，这样就行了。”

Despite himself, Crowley couldn’t help saying, “Ah. That’s _nice_.”  
尽管不情愿，克劳利还是忍不住说道：“啊，真不错。”

Aziraphale made a face at him. “Oh…” He gave the angel a half-hearted push towards the former nun. “Go and make yourself useful, then.”  
亚齐拉费尔对他做了个鬼脸。“哦……”他半心半意地把天使推向那位前修女。“去找点有用的事情做吧。”

Crowley smiled as he approached the woman. “Hi. Sorry about all of this.” He studied her. “Daft question, but were you a nun here eleven years ago?”  
克劳利走近那位女士，微笑着说道：“嗨，对于这一切我感到抱歉。”他仔细地观察着她。“这可能是个愚蠢的问题，但是你在十一年前是这里的修女吗？”

The woman smiled placidly. “I was.”  
那位女士平静地微笑着。“是的。”

Crowley gave Aziraphale an amused look. “Well, you got one thing right.”  
克劳利笑着看着阿齐拉费尔。“嗯，你说对了一件事。”

“You,” Aziraphale grumbled, “are going the right way for a smacked bum.”  
“你，”阿齐拉费尔抱怨道，“正朝着挨打屁股的方向走。”

“Promises, promises,” Crowley said, serene smile giving way to a grin when the demon spluttered in shock. “Now, Miss… er… Nun-lady. My friend here gave you a baby. What did you do with it?”  
“光说不练，”克劳利冷静地说道，他的宁静微笑在看到恶魔惊讶地咕哝时变成了一丝狞笑。“现在，小姐……呃……修女。我的朋友给了你一个婴儿。你对它做了什么？”

“I swapped it with the son of the American ambassador,” the woman said.  
“我把它和美国大使的儿子交换了。”那位女士说道。

“She bloody didn’t,” Aziraphale muttered.  
“她真他妈的没做到。”亚齐拉费尔嘟囔道。

“He used to be ambassador to Swindon.”  
他曾经是斯温顿的大使。

Crowley frowned. 克劳利皱了皱眉头。

“Swindon?” Aziraphale echoed. “Oh. Oh _bugger_.”  
"斯温顿？"亚齐拉费尔重复道。"哦。哦该死。"

“Too many pieces in play?” Crowley guessed.  
“局势复杂？”克劳利猜测道。

“Mm. There was a man outside when I arrived. I assumed staff. Perhaps not.” Aziraphale leaned in closer to the woman. “What happened to the other baby?”  
“嗯，我到的时候外面有个男人。我以为是员工。也许不是。”亚齐拉费尔靠近那位女士。“另一个婴儿怎么了？”

“Sister Theresa Garrulous took it away.”  
特蕾莎·加鲁斯修女把它拿走了。

“What about the records?” Crowley suggested hopefully. “I mean, you were a hospital. There had to be records.”  
“档案呢？”克劳利满怀希望地建议道。“我的意思是，你们是一家医院，肯定有档案。”

“Oh yes,” the woman said in the same placid tone, her expression unchanging. “We were very good at keeping records.”  
“哦，是的，”那位女士以同样平静的语调说道，表情不变。“我们在记录方面做得非常好。”

Were, Crowley noticed with a wince. “Where are they?”  
克劳利皱了皱眉头，心中惊讶地想道：“他们在哪里？”

“Destroyed in the fire.” 在火灾中被摧毁。

Aziraphale growled low in his chest, the rumble almost shaking the woman out of her stupor. “Hastur, I’d wager.”  
亚齐拉费尔低声咆哮，低沉的隆隆声几乎把那个女人从恍惚中惊醒。“哈斯特，我敢打赌。”

“Sounds like him,” Crowley agreed unhappily. He glanced at Aziraphale. “I don’t think there’s much point us hanging around here, do you?” The demon nodded, turning and prowling back towards the door. Crowley sighed impatiently. “Aziraphale! Didn’t you forget something?”  
“听起来像他，”克劳利不开心地同意道。他瞥了一眼阿齐拉费尔。“我觉得我们在这里晃荡也没什么意义，你觉得呢？”恶魔点了点头，转身朝门口踱去。克劳利不耐烦地叹了口气。“阿齐拉费尔！你难道忘了什么吗？”

“You’re the _nice_ one,” Aziraphale called back.  
“你是个好人，”阿齐拉费尔回答道。

Crowley very nearly swore aloud. He patted the woman on the shoulder. “You’ll wake up refreshed and relaxed, remembering your favourite dreams.” He snapped his fingers, then turned and ran after Aziraphale, who was already heading out of the front doors. He caught up in the grounds, walking between the screaming paintballers and the police attempting to subdue them and wrestle their guns out of their hands. “What now?”  
克劳利几乎忍不住要咒骂出声。他拍了拍那个女人的肩膀。“你会醒来精神焕发、放松愉快，记得你最喜欢的梦境。”他弹了弹手指，然后转身追赶起已经朝前门走去的阿齐拉费尔。他在场地上追上了他，穿过尖叫的彩弹玩家和试图制服他们、夺下他们手中枪支的警察之间行走。“现在怎么办？”

“Buggered if I know,” Aziraphale said, shaking his head.  
“我可不知道，”阿齐拉费尔摇了摇头说道。

“But we _can_ find him, can’t we? I mean, he’s bound to start showing signs or something.”  
“但是我们能找到他，对吧？我的意思是，他肯定会开始显示一些迹象或者什么的。”

The demon shook his head moodily. “Not to us. He’s… it’s a protective camouflage for his own protection. I doubt any prying occult forces would be able to find him if they put all their attention into it.”  
恶魔闷闷不乐地摇了摇头。“对我们来说不是。这是他自我保护的一种保护伪装。我怀疑任何窥探的神秘力量如果全力以赴，也不会找到他。”

“Occult? Witches and things?”  
“神秘？女巫和其他东西？”

Aziraphale gave him a long, slow look. “Like us.”  
亚齐拉费尔给了他一个长长的、缓慢的眼神。"像我们一样。"

Crowley reared back, offended. “I’m _not_ occult.”  
克劳利退后了一步，感到被冒犯了。“我不是邪教的。”

“Wings. Magic. Radiant when powered up. Sounds occult to me.”  
翅膀。魔法。充满力量时闪耀夺目。听起来对我来说有点神秘。

“I’m an angel!” he protested indignantly. “I’m _ethereal_.”  
"我是个天使！" 他愤然抗议道。"我是超凡脱俗的存在。"

Aziraphale’s sombre expression gave way to a mischievous smile. “Keep telling yourself that, my dear. I’m sure it’s very reassuring.”  
亚齐拉费尔的严肃表情转为了一个调皮的微笑。“继续对自己说吧，亲爱的。我相信这会让你感到很安心。”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

“Maybe there’s some other way to find him.”  
也许还有其他办法找到他。

They were heading back in the direction of London, the later afternoon already tinting towards twilight and Aziraphale glanced at the angel. “If you have any suggestions, my dear,” he said, “I’m all ears.”  
他们正朝着伦敦的方向返回，午后已经渐渐变暗，接近黄昏时分，亚齐拉费尔望向天使。"如果你有什么建议，亲爱的，"他说道，"我洗耳恭听。"

The angel gave him such a hopeful look that he wished he had some kind of answer. “Don’t your lot have some way of…” He wiggled his fingers. “You know? Keeping tags on yours?”  
天使给了他一个充满希望的眼神，以至于他希望自己能有某种答案。“你们这些人有没有什么办法……”他扭动着手指。“你懂的吗？跟踪你们的人？”

“Not this time,” Aziraphale admitted gloomily. “He’s not ours. Not in full. Not _yet_. When he wants to be found, we’ll be able to find him, but not before. I don’t think they put in any fail-safes in case of accidental Antichrist loss.”  
“这次不行，”阿齐拉费尔沮丧地承认道。“他不是我们的。还不完全是。还没有。当他想被找到的时候，我们就能找到他，但在此之前不行。我觉得他们没有设置任何防护措施以防止意外失去反基督。”

Crowley’s face creased in distress. “We _have_ to find him!”  
克劳利的脸上露出了痛苦的皱纹。“我们必须找到他！”

“Tell me something I don’t know.” Aziraphale ran a hand over his face. If they didn’t, it wouldn’t just mean war. It would mean the end of everything as they knew it and that… God, he wasn’t even ready to contemplate what that would mean.  
“告诉我一些我不知道的事情。”亚齐拉费尔用手抚摸着自己的脸。如果他们不知道，那不仅仅意味着战争，还意味着一切的终结，他甚至还没有准备好去思考那意味着什么。

“Right…” Crowley nodded. “Right. Sorry. Of course.” He shook his head, rubbing at his forehead. “I– look, I know you’re a demon, but are you sure you can’t feel anything?”  
“对的……”克劳利点了点头。“对的。抱歉。当然。”他摇了摇头，揉了揉额头。“我——听着，我知道你是个恶魔，但你确定你真的感觉不到什么吗？”

“Anything?” Aziraphale inquired, frowning. The angel waved vaguely towards the woods around them, his eyes all over the place. “Oh, is this the… weird-good thing you were on about earlier?”  
“什么都可以吗？”亚齐拉费尔皱着眉头询问道。天使向周围的树林随意挥了挥手，目光四处游移。“哦，这就是你之前说的那个奇怪又好的东西吗？”

“Mm.” Crowley glanced at him. “It’s everywhere. It’s… I can’t put my finger on it. Love, yeah, but something more than that. I’ve never felt anything as intense as this before.” He waved around again. “It’s all over here. I mean _all_ over.”  
“嗯。”克劳利瞥了他一眼。“无处不在。我说不清楚。爱，对，但还有更多。我从未感受过如此强烈的东西。”他再次挥手示意四周。“到处都是。我是说真的，到处都是。”

Aziraphale searched his face. “I can’t feel anything unusual. Nothing more than the usual background noise I get around you.”  
亚齐拉费尔审视着他的脸。“我感觉不到任何异常。除了我在你身边常常感受到的背景噪音之外，没有其他特别的感觉。”

Crowley blinked stupidly at him. “You get background noise around me?”  
克劳利愚蠢地瞪着他。“你在我身边听到背景噪音了吗？”

Aziraphale widened his eyes. “Like a choir of angels going ‘aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!’,” he lied cheerfully. He peered out into the darkening road, sniffing curiously. “No. Not a sausage, I’m afraid, eyes, ears or nose.”  
亚齐拉费尔睁大了眼睛。“就像一群天使在高声唱着‘啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！’，”他愉快地撒了个谎。他好奇地凑近黑暗中的道路，嗅了嗅。“没有，很抱歉，什么都没有，眼睛、耳朵或者鼻子。”

“Oh.” Crowley’s frown deepened. “Right.” He took a breath then laughed. “Probably just tired. Been burning the candle at both ends, a bit.”  
“哦。”克劳利皱起了眉头。“好吧。”他深吸了一口气，然后笑了起来。“可能只是累了。最近有点熬夜过度。”

“And in the middle,” Aziraphale said, grinning and knocking him on the arm.  
“而且在中间，”亚齐拉费尔开心地说着，笑着拍了拍他的胳膊。

Crowley shot a half-hearted glare at him. “I’m not that–”  
克劳利对他投以了一种半心半意的怒视。“我并不是那种人——”

There was a crump of metal against metal and a shriek and something flew over the bonnet of the car. Crowley slammed on the brakes so hard, Aziraphale almost pitched headfirst through the windscreen.  
有金属撞击声和尖叫声，一样东西飞过汽车的引擎盖。克劳利猛踩刹车，阿齐拉费尔差点头朝前冲出挡风玻璃。

“I hit something!” Crowley yelped, leaning forward over the steering wheel, trying to see.  
“我撞到了什么东西！”克劳利尖叫着，向前倾身越过方向盘，努力看清楚。

Aziraphale swung out of the car, peering along the front chassis of the Bentley. There was a deep and impressive dent in the metal. “I don’t think so,” he said, bending to speak to the angel, who was clinging to the steering wheel, a panicked look on his face. “I think something hit you.”  
亚齐拉费尔从车里跳下来，凑近宾利车前部底盘查看。金属上有一个深深的、令人印象深刻的凹痕。“我觉得不是我们撞的，”他弯下腰对着那个紧紧抓住方向盘、脸上带着惊慌表情的天使说道。“我觉得是有什么东西撞到了你。”

There was a groan from the far side of the car and the angel shot out the driver’s side far faster than he had any right to.  
车的远处传来一声呻吟，天使从司机座位上迅速跳了出去，速度比他应有的要快得多。

“Angel!” Aziraphale groaned. “Not your fault. Blame the stupid human who ran into you.” He ducked his head back into the car. “And you didn’t help, did you?” He knocked a fist on the dashboard in warning. “You’re meant to keep him safe.” The lights on the dashboard dimmed. “So,” he growled, “am I going to have to fix you or are you going to take care of yourself?”  
“天使！”亚齐拉费尔呻吟道。“不是你的错。怪那个撞上你的愚蠢人类。”他把头缩回车里。“你也没帮上忙，是吧？”他用拳头敲了一下仪表盘，警告道。“你应该保护他的安全。”仪表盘上的灯光暗了下来。“所以，”他咆哮道，“是我要修理你还是你自己会照顾好自己？”

Outside, there was a defiant creak and pop of metal reverting to its original shape.  
外面，传来一阵挑衅的金属嘎吱作响声，恢复了原本的形状。

Aziraphale smiled in relief. “Good.” He patted the dashboard. “I’ll take care of the breakages and the angel, all right?”  
亚齐拉费尔松了口气，露出了一丝宽慰的微笑。“太好了。”他轻拍了一下仪表盘。“我会处理好损坏的事物和天使，没问题吧？”

He hurried around to the other side of the car, touching the cracked glass of the front lamp and brushing away the scratches across the bonnet.  
他匆忙走到车的另一侧，触摸着前灯上的破裂玻璃，擦去了引擎盖上的划痕。

Crowley was off the road on the leafy ground, gently helping a young human women back to her feet. A whisper of a miracle reached the demon and he saw the girl’s wrist shift strangely as broken bones healed up.  
克劳利在绿树成荫的地面上蹲着，轻轻地帮助一位年轻的女人重新站起来。一丝奇迹的低语传到了恶魔的耳中，他看到女孩的手腕在骨折的地方奇异地移动，伤口迅速愈合。

“Here,” the angel said, his face white as he helped her over to the car. “Take a seat. I’ve got a flask of tea in the boot.” He looked imploringly at Aziraphale who groaned, but picked his way down into the ditch to retrieve the girl’s bike. The front tyre was entirely buckled, but by the time he lifted it up, it was as good as new.  
“在这里，”天使说道，他的脸色苍白，帮助她走向车辆。“坐下吧。后备箱里有一瓶茶。”他恳求地看着阿齐拉费尔，后者叹了口气，但还是小心翼翼地走下沟渠，把女孩的自行车捡了起来。前轮完全弯曲，但在他抬起它的时候，它就像新的一样好。

“My dear, I hate to be critical,” he said, as he wheeled it back up to the car, where the girl was sipping tea from a plastic cup. “But don’t you know it’s a criminal offence riding around in the dark without a helmet or a light on your bike.”  
“亲爱的，我不想挑剔，”他说着，将自行车推回到车旁，女孩正从塑料杯里啜饮茶水。“但你难道不知道在黑暗中骑车没有头盔或灯光是违法行为吗？”

“Shush!” Crowley said, plea and mortification all over his face. “Let her be. She had her light on. I wasn’t– we didn’t see each other, that’s all.”  
“嘘！”克劳利说道，脸上满是恳求和尴尬。“别管她了。她开着灯。我没有——我们只是没看见彼此，仅此而已。”

Aziraphale took pity on the angel. God only knew he’d probably spend the next six months beating himself up about it, if they lasted that long. He turned his attention to the girl instead. Twenties. Maybe thirties. Long black hair decorated with bits of the shrubbery she’d landed in. Almost as pale as Crowley himself.  
亚齐拉费尔对那个天使感到同情。只有上帝知道，如果他们能撑过这段时间，他可能会花上接下来的六个月来自责。他转而关注那个女孩。二十多岁，也许三十多岁。长长的黑发上还挂着她降落时带来的灌木碎片。几乎和克劳利本人一样苍白。

“How’s your head, my dear?” he inquired. “A little tender?”  
“亲爱的，你的头还好吗？”他询问道。“有点儿疼吗？”

“It’ll be fine,” she said warily and he almost smiled. Of course. An _American_. That would explain the utter disregard for property and life of others.  
“没事的，”她小心地说道，他几乎笑了。当然。一个美国人。这就解释了对他人财产和生命的彻底漠视。

“We’re giving her a lift back to the village,” Crowley said and he knew better than to argue with the resolute look on the angel’s face. If he needed to do a little good to make himself feel better, then so be it. “Can you put the bike on the bike rack?”  
“克劳利说：“我们送她回村里。”他知道不应该和天使坚定的表情争论。如果他需要做一些善事来让自己感觉好些，那就这样吧。“你能把自行车放在自行车架上吗？”

Aziraphale frowned in confusion. “What bike–”  
亚齐拉费尔困惑地皱起了眉头。“什么自行车——”

Metal squeaked and oh, of course. The Bentley just wanted to embarrass him again. He bared his teeth, half-heartedly hissing at the stupid car as he wheeled the bike to the rack. Goes around hitting humans and then plays the gallant hero, giving her a lift home. Reckless idiot of a machine.  
金属发出刺耳的尖叫声，哦，当然了。那辆宾利又想再次羞辱他。他咬紧牙关，半心半意地嘶嘶着对着那辆愚蠢的车，将自行车推到架子上。它四处撞人，然后又扮演英勇的英雄，送她回家。这辆鲁莽的机器真是个白痴。

He grumbled profanities as it as he strapped the bike onto the rack, giving the bumper a knock with his foot for good measure. The engine sputtered, spurting a puff of grey exhaust against his cream trousers.  
他嘟囔着脏话，一边将自行车绑在车架上，一边用脚敲了一下保险杠以确保牢固。发动机咕噜着，喷出一团灰色的尾气，弄脏了他的米色裤子。

“Oh, you little bastard,” he growled.  
“哦，你这个小混蛋。”他咆哮道。

He circled back around the car, sliding back into the passenger seat and pointedly ignoring the human who was huddled in the backseat, a basket, her skirts and – inexplicably – a large breadknife taking up all of the room.  
他绕到车的另一边，滑回副驾驶座位，故意不理会坐在后座上的那个人，她蜷缩着身子，一只篮子、她的裙子和——莫名其妙地——一把大面包刀占据了所有的空间。

“Did you fix it?” Crowley muttered out of the corner of his mouth as they drove on.  
“你修好了吗？”克劳利嘟囔着说，他们继续驾驶着。

“The Bentley?” “那辆宾利？”

“The _bike_.” 自行车。

Aziraphale nodded. “Good as new,” he replied, although he neglected to mention that he’d flattened the tyres on principle so she would have to work on them before she could throw herself at any other cars. Also, he’d unhooked the chain. And one of the pedals would need to be tended to with a screwdriver before it could be used.  
亚齐拉费尔点了点头。“好像新的一样，”他回答道，尽管他没有提到他出于原则把轮胎放气，这样她就得先修理好它们才能撞向其他车辆。此外，他还解开了链条。其中一个踏板需要用螺丝刀修理好才能使用。

The angel reached over and squeezed his arm gratefully. “Thank you.”  
天使伸手过去，感激地握住了他的胳膊。“谢谢你。”

Aziraphale looked down at Crowley’s hand, then patted it with a smile. “Nonsense, you silly goose. You know you needn’t say that.”  
亚齐拉费尔望着克劳利的手，然后微笑着拍了拍它。“胡说八道，你这个傻瓜。你知道你不必说那些话。”

“Still. You didn’t need to.”  
还是的。你不需要这样做。

“Get me a cake and we’ll call it even, hm?” He jerked his head towards the back of the car. “After we drop her off.”  
“给我买个蛋糕，我们就算扯平了，嗯？”他朝车后面点了点头。“在我们送她走之后。”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

There was a café at the services halfway back to London and to be entirely honest, Crowley needed to have a sit down and a cup of coffee. He would’ve preferred something stronger, but they still had a way to go and he didn’t trust himself – or the demon – to get the rest of the way intact if he was tipsy. His hands were still shaking and he kept on replaying the crunch of the bike hitting the Bentley over and over in his mind.  
在返回伦敦的半路上有一家咖啡馆，老实说，克劳利需要坐下来喝杯咖啡。他更愿意喝点更烈的东西，但他们还有一段路要走，他不相信自己——或者那个恶魔——如果喝醉了，能够完整地走完剩下的路程。他的手还在颤抖，他一遍又一遍地回放着摩托车撞上宾利的碰撞声。

Aziraphale didn’t question his decision to pull in, or even complain about the quality of the slice of devil’s food cake that Crowley presented him with.  
亚齐拉费尔并没有对他决定停下来感到疑惑，甚至也没有抱怨克劳利给他递上的那块恶魔食品蛋糕的质量。

Sometimes, Crowley thought, Aziraphale was nice simply by not being his usual self. He offered quiet and calm and all the things he seemed to intuitively know that Crowley needed, when he needed them the most, and Crowley couldn’t have been more grateful.  
有时候，克劳利想，阿齐拉费尔之所以好，仅仅是因为他不再像平常那样。他提供了宁静和平静，以及所有他似乎本能地知道克劳利在最需要的时候需要的东西，克劳利感激不尽。

“I do wonder,” Aziraphale hummed pensively as he carefully dissected the cake into half a dozen identical pieces, “if we might be able to get another human to find the boy.”  
“我真的很好奇，”阿齐拉费尔沉思地哼着，小心地将蛋糕切成六块完全相同的部分，“我们是否能找到另一个人类来找到那个男孩。”

Crowley blinked, stirring himself out of the thoughts of metal and the scream and the flying body. “What?”  
克劳利眨了眨眼，从关于金属、尖叫和飞身的思绪中清醒过来。“什么？”

“The Antichrist.” The demon nudged the plate towards him, offering a piece of the cake, but he shook his head, his hands wrapped around his coffee cup. “Technically, at the moment, he’s human. Surely another human would be able to find him, if we can’t.”  
“反基督者。”恶魔将盘子推向他，递出一块蛋糕，但他摇了摇头，双手紧握着咖啡杯。“从技术上讲，此刻他还是人类。如果我们找不到他，肯定会有其他人类能找到他。”

Crowley frowned. “But didn’t you say something about him having an automatic defence thingie?”  
克劳利皱了皱眉头。“但是你不是说过他有一个自动防御装置吗？”

“Only if we use occult forces,” Aziraphale said, sounding far too optimistic after the bloody awful day they’d had. “I mean, yes, technically, they would be _working_ for an occult force, but if they’re not occult themselves, maybe they would be able to get close enough to identify who we’re looking for?”  
“只有我们使用神秘力量，”阿齐拉费尔说道，尽管他们度过了一天糟糕透顶的日子，但听起来过于乐观。“我的意思是，是的，从技术上讲，他们将为神秘力量工作，但如果他们本身并不神秘，也许他们能够靠近足够接近以确认我们要找的人是谁？”

Crowley lifted a hand to rub at his eyes. “Maybe,” he reluctantly agreed. God, he wanted to be home, and safely curled up with something a hell of a lot stronger than watered-down black coffee. “Might be too strong for that, though. Might be able to make suspicion slide off him like… whatever it is water slides off.”  
克劳利抬起手揉了揉眼睛。“也许吧，”他不情愿地同意了。天啊，他真想回家，安全地蜷缩在比稀释的黑咖啡更强烈的东西旁边。“不过，这可能太强了。也许能让怀疑像水滑落一样从他身上滑走。”

“Umbrellas?” “雨伞？”

Crowley shook his head, then returned his attention to turning his cup between his hands.  
克劳利摇了摇头，然后把注意力转回到双手之间转动的杯子上。

“The thing is…” Aziraphale hesitated, then leaned closer conspiratorially. “For quite a while now, I’ve had a team of human operatives.”  
“事情是这样的…”亚齐拉费尔犹豫了一下，然后更加亲密地靠近说道。“实际上，我已经有一支由人类特工组成的团队相当长的时间了。”

That made Crowley blink at him. “You?”  
这让克劳利瞪大了眼睛。“你？”

“Don’t sounds so surprised, my dear.” The demon popped another piece of cake in his mouth. “I’ve found plenty of uses for humans in my time.”  
“别那么惊讶，亲爱的。”恶魔又塞了一块蛋糕进嘴里。“我在这段时间里找到了很多利用人类的方法。”

Despite himself, one side of Crowley’s mouth twitched. “Yeah. I remember Shakespeare.”  
尽管不情愿，克劳利的嘴角还是抽动了一下。“是的，我记得莎士比亚。”

A wistful look crossed the demon’s face. “Such a gift of oratory, that man.”  
恶魔脸上闪过一丝忧郁的神情。“他真是个演讲天才。”

“Is that what they’re calling it these days?”  
这就是他们现在叫它的名字吗？

Aziraphale’s expression brightened. “Well! You must be feeling better. Your sarcasm is turned on again.”  
亚齐拉费尔的表情明亮起来。“嗯！你一定感觉好些了。你的讽刺又开始发作了。”

Crowley even managed a rueful laugh. “Maybe,” he agreed, and he did. Not 100 percent, but a little bit. “Look, the human thing… it’s not a bad idea. I’ve got a few people of my own. I could get them to put their feelers out. See if they can dig anything up.”  
克劳利甚至发出了一声苦笑。“也许吧，”他同意了，并且确实如此。虽然不是百分之百，但还是有一点。“听着，人类这个主意…不错。我也有几个人手。我可以让他们去打探一下，看看能不能找到什么线索。”

“Feeler? Digging? Are you sure they’re not some kind of creepy crawly from your garden?” Aziraphale said, making a face and earning a crooked smile. The demon dabbed at his lips with a napkin, then set down his fork. “Do you think our people should work together?”  
“触角？挖掘？你确定它们不是你花园里的一些可怕的爬虫吗？”亚齐拉费尔说着，做了个鬼脸，得到了一个歪笑。恶魔用餐巾纸擦了擦嘴唇，然后放下叉子。“你觉得我们的人民应该合作吗？”

Crowley’s mind presented him with the thought of Shadwell crossing paths with the employees of a quite literal demon. There would be pins and fire and probably a lot of messy misunderstandings. “I don’t think that’s a very good idea,” he said, shaking his head. “Mine aren’t really very… sophisticated, politically speaking.”  
克劳利的脑海中浮现出沙德维尔与一位非常真实的恶魔员工交集的想法。那里会有针和火，可能会有很多混乱的误解。“我觉得这不是一个很好的主意，”他摇了摇头。“就政治上来说，我的并不是很高明。”

“Mm.” Aziraphale pushed his plate aside. “No. Mine either. But if we both set out people on it, we can divide and conquer. It gives us double the chances, two teams out looking, doesn’t it? What do you think?”  
“嗯。”亚齐拉费尔把盘子推到一边。“我也不喜欢。但如果我们都派人去做，我们可以分而治之。这样我们就有双倍的机会，两个团队出去寻找，对吧？你觉得呢？”

Crowley nodded, lost in thought. Technically, yes, he could unleash Shadwell, but that was always a bit of a loose cannon. But who else could he really ask? There wasn’t anyone else he could ask to put themselves in harm’s way for a mysterious supernatural force. Shadwell was part of a Witchfinder Army. They’d be fine with any kind of… strange requests. Hell, they’d probably even set out a stakeout in one of those hiding places they used to hunt–  
克劳利点了点头，陷入了沉思。从技术上讲，他确实可以释放沙德维尔，但那总是有点不可控。但是他还能问谁呢？没有其他人可以请他们为了一个神秘的超自然力量而置身于危险之中。沙德维尔是女巫猎人军队的一员。他们对于任何奇怪的请求都不会介意。见鬼，他们甚至可能在他们用来狩猎的那些藏身之处之一设下伏击——

“Ducks!” “鸭子！”

Aziraphale blinked at him. “I beg your pardon?”  
亚齐拉费尔瞪大了眼睛。“请您再说一遍？”

“What water slides off!” It was always such a relief when he remembered something that had slipped his mind. He could see the amused bemusement on the demon’s face. “Sorry. You were saying?”  
“水滑过去了！”每当他想起一些曾经忘记的事情时，总是感到如释重负。他能看到恶魔脸上的嘲笑和困惑。“抱歉，你刚才在说什么来着？”

“Human operatives?” Aziraphale prompted.  
“人类特工？”亚齐拉费尔追问道。

“Oh. Yes. Maybe.” He looked down at his coffee that had gone cold, then nodded towards the door. “Shall we?”  
“哦。是的。也许。”他低头看着已经变冷的咖啡，然后向门口点了点头。“我们走吧？”

The drive back to London was pretty quiet. Crowley had a distinct feeling Aziraphale was trying not to distract him from the road for a change, which said the accident had either shaken him up or he was worried about the impact it had had on Crowley. Either way, the demon was on his best behaviour until they reached Soho and Crowley pulled up outside the bookshop.  
回伦敦的路上相当安静。克劳利有一种明显的感觉，阿齐拉费尔这次竟然不想分散他的注意力，这说明这次事故要么让他受到了惊吓，要么他担心这对克劳利产生了什么影响。无论哪种情况，这个恶魔在抵达苏豪区并将车停在书店外之前都表现得非常规矩。

“Human operatives?” Aziraphale prompted again. “You call yours, I call mine, and we regroup in the morning?”  
"人类特工？"亚齐拉费尔再次提醒道。"你叫你的，我叫我的，明天早上我们再集合？"

“Hm?” Crowley nodded distantly. “Yeah. Sounds good.”  
“嗯？”克劳利冷淡地点了点头。“嗯，听起来不错。”

A warm hand squeezed his shoulder. “My dear, are you sure you’re all right?”  
一只温暖的手轻轻地握住了他的肩膀。“亲爱的，你确定没事吗？”

Crowley looked at him, one of the only beings who ever bothered to ask that question. “I don’t know,” he admitted. “What do we do if we can’t find him? What happens?”  
克劳利看着他，他是少数几个曾经费心去问这个问题的存在之一。“我不知道，”他承认道。“如果我们找不到他，我们该怎么办？会发生什么？”

Aziraphale’s mouth turned in a smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “Oh, don’t worry about maybe. We’ll find him and we’ll… deal with him.”  
亚齐拉费尔微微一笑，但眼神却没有跟上。“哦，别担心，或许我们会找到他，然后……处理掉他。”

Deal with him. 处理他。

He nodded, looking out of the windscreen again, hearing the crump of metal and the scream. “Right. Yeah.” He tried to smile, but it felt as convincing as Aziraphale’s looked. “Deal with him.” He rattled his fingers on the edge of the steering wheel. “I’ll be off. Call my people.”  
他点了点头，再次望向挡风玻璃，听到金属碰撞和尖叫声。“好的。是的。”他试图微笑，但感觉不像阿齐拉费尔的笑容那样令人信服。“处理他。”他在方向盘边缘上敲动手指。“我要走了。联系我的人。”

“My dear…” Aziraphale sounded worried and Crowley couldn’t – wouldn’t – look at him, for fear that the concern and empathy from a _demon_ might undo him.  
“亲爱的……”阿齐拉费尔的声音带着担忧，而克劳利却无法——也不愿意——看着他，因为害怕来自恶魔的关切和同情会让他崩溃。

“I’m _fine_,” he lied. “Go on.”  
“我很好。”他撒谎道。“继续吧。”

The demon sighed, but he got out the car. “You know where I’ll be,” he said with such gentleness that Crowley had to clench his teeth to keep his face from betraying him. “I’ll call you in the morning.”  
恶魔叹了口气，但他还是下了车。“你知道我会在哪里，”他温柔地说道，克劳利不得不咬紧牙关，以免露出破绽。“明天早上我会给你打电话。”

“Yeah.” He nodded tightly. “Good idea. Night.”  
"好的。" 他紧紧地点了点头。"好主意。晚安。"

Aziraphale sighed and closed the door and Crowley forced his foot down on the accelerator before he could change his mind or look back.  
亚齐拉费尔叹了口气，关上了门，而克劳利则猛踩油门，不给他回头的机会。

It wasn’t until he was parked up in the shadow of their church that he let himself sag forward against his folded arms on the steering wheel, breathing hard, a profanity sitting heavily on the tip of his tongue. God, he needed a drink and to never have to think of anything ever again.  
直到他停在教堂的阴影下，他才让自己向前倾斜，把头压在折叠的手臂上，喘着粗气，一句脏话沉甸甸地憋在舌尖上。天啊，他需要一杯酒，永远不再去想任何事情。

“Come on,” he whispered to himself. “Come _on_. Pull yourself together, you idiot.”  
“加油，”他对自己低声说道。“加油。振作起来，你这个白痴。”

Five minutes passed, then another ten, before he managed to sit back up. A few more followed before he unfolded out of the car. He braced his hand on the roof, turning his face up to the star-speckled sky.  
五分钟过去了，然后又过了十分钟，他才勉强坐直。再过了几分钟，他才从车里缓缓爬了出来。他用手撑在车顶上，抬头仰望满布星辰的天空。

“Enjoying the show?” he asked, voice shaking. “Got a good view.”  
“看得过瘾吗？”他问道，声音颤抖着。“视野不错。”

A gust caught the branches of the trees and a flurry of leaves scattered around him, several sticking to the window of the Bentley. He sighed, picking them off one by one, then frowned, peering in through the glass. There was something on the floor in the back seat.  
一阵风吹动了树枝，一片片的树叶在他周围飘散，有几片粘在宾利车窗上。他叹了口气，一片片地把它们拨掉，然后皱起眉头，透过玻璃往里面看。后座上有一样东西。

Crowley pulled the door open, leaning in to pick up the dark rectangle from the mat. It was a book, an old and well-loved one by the look of it. It couldn’t have been one of Aziraphale’s. He’d never be so clumsy with his books, which meant…  
克劳利拉开门，弯腰从垫子上拾起那个黑色的长方形物体。那是一本书，看起来古老而备受喜爱。这绝对不可能是阿齐拉费尔的书。他从不会对自己的书如此粗心，这就意味着...

“Oh no,” he groaned. The woman. The bike.  
"哦不，"他呻吟道。那个女人。那辆自行车。

He turned the book over, reading the front cover and his heart felt like it stopped. He’d heard about this book. He'd heard Aziraphale grumbling about never being able to find a copy when he had every other book of prophecy on record. It wasn’t meant to exist. It definitely wasn’t meant to be in the back seat of his car.    
他把书翻过来，读着封面，他的心感觉停了下来。他听说过这本书。他听过阿齐拉费尔抱怨说，他找不到这本书，尽管他有记录上的其他所有预言书。这本书本来就不存在。它绝对不应该在他车后座上。

_The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter Witch_.  
艾格妮丝·纳特女巫的准确而美好的预言。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

To say that Crowley wasn’t a big reader would be an understatement.  
说克劳利不是一个热衷阅读的人简直是个轻描淡写。

In the chapter house that he had made his home, there were only a couple of books and those were religious texts that people always expected to be available in a building that used to be in a church. He never read them unless he had to, not when he already had more than enough knowledge and millennia of memories swirling around in his mind.  
在他称之为家的大厅里，只有几本书，而且都是人们总是期望在曾经是教堂的建筑里能找到的宗教文本。除非必须，他从不阅读它们，因为他已经拥有足够的知识和千年的记忆在脑海中回旋。

Still, he had heard of the Nutter book before. It was the holy grail of prophetic texts, according to Aziraphale, who had coveted it for centuries. It was the only prophetic book in history known to contain entirely accurate prophecies.  
然而，他之前听说过《纳特书》。根据亚齐拉费尔的说法，它是预言文献中的圣杯，他已经渴望拥有它几个世纪了。这是历史上唯一一本已知完全准确的预言书籍。

He locked his front door behind him and sat down on the couch, staring at it.  
他关上前门，坐在沙发上，盯着它。

If Aziraphale was right, if the prophecies were true, then maybe it would have something useful to tell them about the coming apocalypse. He laid the book in his lap, closed his eyes and opened it at a random page, jabbing a finger against the text.  
如果阿齐拉费尔是对的，如果预言是真实的，那么也许它会告诉他们一些关于即将来临的启示的有用信息。他将书放在膝盖上，闭上眼睛，随机翻开一页，用手指戳向文字。

“Prophecy 629,” he read aloud, “_In the ruined church of the angel of the book, when these words are read, then the end times are certies upon us_.” Crowley stared at it, then looked out the window to the church that had once been ruined and was now his, his heart thundering against his ribs. He followed the rest of the prophecy with his fingertip. “_Mind ye the words of the devil._”  
“预言629，”他大声读道，“在那本天使的书所在的废弃教堂里，当这些话被朗读时，末日即将降临。”克劳利盯着它看，然后望向窗外的教堂，曾经是废墟，现在却属于他，他的心在胸腔中狂跳不已。他用手指跟随着预言的其余部分。“牢记恶魔的话语。”

Okay. 好的。

Right. 好的。

So. 所以。

Okay. 好的。

The book was legit. The book had at least one real prophecy, which meant there could maybe be others and that was good. Maybe it would have a solution. Or maybe it could tell them where the Antichrist was.  
这本书是真实的。这本书至少有一个真正的预言，这意味着可能还有其他的预言，这是好事。也许它能提供一个解决方案。或者它能告诉他们反基督在哪里。

Crowley flicked back to the first page of the book and slid off the couch to sit on the floor beside the coffee table. “You ended up with me for a reason,” he murmured, “All the times you could’ve shown up and you show up now…” He reached over for his notepad and pen and, for the first time since Eden, he started to read.  
克劳利翻到书的第一页，从沙发上滑下来，坐在咖啡桌旁的地板上。“你和我在一起是有原因的，”他低声说道，“所有你可能出现的时刻，你偏偏选择现在出现…”他伸手拿起笔记本和笔，在伊甸园之后，他第一次开始阅读。

It was slow-going at first, teasing apart meaning from riddles and nonsense, working out what was important and what was irrelevant. Strips of paper poked out from page after page of the book, marking passages for cross-reference. Little by little, it got easier. He spotted the patterns, recognised the framing, the phrasing, the feel of the text.  
一开始进展缓慢，从谜语和胡言乱语中辨别出意义，弄清楚什么是重要的，什么是无关紧要的。纸条从书的一页又一页中探出来，标记着需要交叉参考的段落。渐渐地，情况变得更容易了。他发现了模式，认出了框架、措辞和文本的感觉。

The words flowed over him, as they had a long, long time ago. His pen scratched, the words, the text, marked down, pieces of knowledge of a greater whole coming together as the word grew lighter and brighter outside of the windows.  
文字如潮水般涌过他，就像很久很久以前一样。他的笔划过纸面，文字、篇章被记录下来，作为整体知识的一部分汇聚在一起，而窗外的世界也因此变得更加明亮。

Once, twice, he staggered up from the floor, fetched one of the holy books or an atlas, and stumbled back. Town names were scribbled down, scored out, replaced. Pages were ripped from his notepad, spread in a growing constellation of information on the table. His head was throbbing, but he’d gathered information before, far more powerful and overwhelming, so he could do it again. Had to do it again. Had to find any answer there might be.  
曾经，两次，他从地板上蹒跚起身，拿起一本圣书或地图册，然后又跌跌撞撞地回来。城镇的名字被涂抹、划掉、替换。他的笔记本上的页面被撕下，散落在桌子上形成了一个越来越庞大的信息星座。他的头痛欲裂，但他以前收集过更强大、更压倒性的信息，所以他可以再次做到。必须再次做到。必须找到任何可能的答案。

His head was drooping over the table, his hand aching when his phone buzzed in his pocket and almost scared the living hell out of him.  
他的头低垂在桌子上，手疼得厉害。就在这时，他口袋里的手机嗡嗡作响，差点把他吓个半死。

“Ngh?” he croaked hoarsely.  
“嗯？”他嘶哑地嗓音低沉地说道。

“Crowley? Are you all right, my dear?”  
“克劳利？亲爱的，你还好吗？”

Crowley stared at his shaking hand, the pen trembling in his bruised fingertips, the book, and at the array of information he had spread around him. He wanted to tell Aziraphale what he was looking at, what he might have found, but – and he couldn’t say why in that moment – he lied, “Just woke up.”  
克劳利凝视着颤抖的手，笔在他受伤的指尖上颤抖着，书本和他散落在周围的各种信息。他想告诉阿齐拉费尔他正在看什么，他可能找到了什么，但是——在那一刻他无法说出原因——他撒了谎，“刚刚醒来。”

“Oh, good. Any news?” 哦，好的。有什么消息吗？

Crowley rubbed at his eyes. “What?”  
克劳利揉了揉眼睛。“什么？”

“News? From your people? I’m meeting mine later on.”  
“新闻？来自你的人？我晚些时候要见我的人。”

“Oh.” Oh, damn. “No. Not yet.” He drummed his fingertips anxiously on the edge of the table. He couldn’t lie, not completely, not to the demon, though. “Got some leads to look into.”  
"哦。" 哦，该死。"还没有。" 他焦虑地用指尖在桌边上鼓起节奏。他不能完全撒谎，不能对那个恶魔撒谎。"有一些线索要调查。"

“Call anytime,” Aziraphale said and Crowley ached, hearing the warm smile in the demon’s voice.  
“随时给我打电话，”亚齐拉费尔说道，而克劳利听到了恶魔声音中温暖的笑容，心中感到痛苦。

“Mm.” He terminated the call and dropped the phone on the table, pressing his face into his hands. He shouldn’t have lied, especially not to the only person who was trying to help him, but it was all… a lot. Too much. Needed time. Needed to concentrate. Needed to think.  
“嗯。”他挂断了电话，将手机放在桌子上，双手托着脸。他不应该撒谎，尤其是对唯一一个试图帮助他的人，但这一切...太多了。太多了。需要时间。需要集中注意力。需要思考。

He looked down at the book, then frowned.  
他低头看着书，然后皱了皱眉。

_Prophecy 3817. The Number of the Beast is in the Revelayting of Sainte John, call hym in Taddesfield. And ye will know hym by this sign, that when ye do call hym, the Lesser Beaste will walk upon his hind legs like unto a Dancing Bear.  
预言3817。兽的数字在圣约翰的启示录中，称之为塔德斯菲尔德。你将通过这个标志认识他，当你呼唤他时，小兽将会像跳舞熊一样用后腿行走。_

“Call him…” Crowley murmured. “Heed the words of the devil. Call… anytime. Call him in Taddesfield… call? Number is in the Revelating…” He stared at it, remembering a drunken conversation many, many years ago. “Revelations.” He groped through the pile of books for the Bible, flicking through to the book of Revelations, the pages rustling. “The number of the beast… number of a man… six hundred threescore and six…”  
“给他打电话…” 克劳利低声说道。“听从魔鬼的话语。随时打电话。在塔德斯菲尔德打电话… 打电话？号码在启示录中…” 他盯着那个号码，回忆起多年前的一个醉酒对话。“启示录。” 他在一堆书中摸索着找到圣经，翻到启示录，纸页沙沙作响。“兽的数字… 人的数字… 六百六十六…”

It couldn’t be that obvious, could it? All the hours of panic and searching and he’d been handed a book with the bloody phone number of the Antichrist?  
这不可能那么明显，对吧？那么多个小时的恐慌和搜寻，结果他拿到的是一本书，上面竟然写着那个该死的大魔王的电话号码？

He checked the area code for Tadfield – the village where they had dropped the book girl off, which was a coincidence he really didn’t want to think too hard about – and his hands were trembling so much he could barely type in the number.  
他查了一下塔德菲尔德的区号——那个他们把书女孩放下的村庄，这个巧合他真的不想过多思考——他的手颤抖得几乎无法输入号码。

“Tadfield oh-four-six-triple-six.” A male voice spoke on the other end. “It’s Arthur Young here.”  
“塔德菲尔德，046666。”另一端传来一个男声。“我是亚瑟·杨。”

Crowley almost breathed a sigh of relief, then froze when – in the background of the call – he heard a boy’s voice excitedly call out “Dad, look! I got dog to walk on his hind legs!”  
克劳利差点松了一口气，然后在电话背景中听到一个男孩兴奋地喊道：“爸爸，快看！我让狗用后腿走路了！”他顿时僵住了

The phone slipped from Crowley’s hand and he sagged back against the couch, staring at the books in front of him.  
手机从克劳利的手中滑落，他无力地倒在沙发上，凝视着眼前的书籍。

“Right number,” he breathed.  
“正确的号码。”他喘着气说道。

That was it. The location of the Antichrist. The _name_ of the Antichrist.  
就是这样。反基督的位置。反基督的名字。

He pressed his shaking hands to his mouth. He’d found him. He’d _found_ him and right now, he was the only person in earth, Heaven and Hell who knew exactly where the boy was. That… it had to be an advantage, didn’t it? Surely he could…  
他颤抖的双手捂住了嘴巴。他找到了他。他找到了他，此刻他是地球、天堂和地狱中唯一一个确切知道那个男孩在哪里的人。那...那一定是个优势，不是吗？他肯定可以...

Could what? Drive to Tadfield without anyone being any the wiser and… and deal with it?  
能做什么？毫不引人注意地开车去塔德菲尔德，然后...然后处理它？

Oh God. 哦天啊。

Deal with it. A tactful way to describe murdering a child. A boy the same age as Warlock. Younger than half the kids who came to work in his garden.  
应对吧。一种委婉的方式来描述谋杀一个孩子。一个和沃洛克同龄的男孩。比那些来他花园工作的孩子们年纪还小。

It wasn’t that he hadn’t seen children die before. Of course he had. He had lived too long not to.  
他并不是说他以前从未见过孩子死亡。当然，他见过。他活得太久了，不可能没有见过。

He had stood by at the flood and heard their screams and then their silence. He’d picked his way through the rubble of Gomorrah. He stood beneath blooded doorways in Tanis and heard the wails. From the walls of Jericho to the killing fields of Cambodia, in country after country, century after century, millennia after millennia.  
他曾在洪水中静静地站着，听着他们的尖叫声，然后听到了他们的沉默。他在蛾摩拉的废墟中艰难地穿行。他站在坦尼斯血迹斑斑的门口，听到了哀鸣声。从耶利哥的城墙到柬埔寨的杀戮领域，在一个又一个国家，一个又一个世纪，一个又一个千年中。

He’d obeyed and they had died and he had stood by, silent and watching. But to go, to take up a holy weapon again for the first time since the first war, to _kill_ someone – a human – a child – with his own two hands?  
他曾经服从过，他们却死去了，而他默默地站在一旁观察。但是现在，他要去，要再次拿起一把神圣的武器，自第一次战争以来第一次杀人——一个人类——一个孩子——用他自己的双手？

No. 不。

Never. 从来没有。

Aziraphale, then? He was a demon, after all. He wouldn’t object to killing a human.  
亚齐拉费尔呢？毕竟他是个恶魔，对杀死人类应该不会有意见。

But then again, he couldn’t, could he? Not _that_ human, not if he wanted to live to see another day. If he openly defied the will of Hell, then they’d come after him, and as frustrating as the demon could be, Crowley couldn’t bear to imagine a world without him, without his laughter and his nonsense and the mischievous gleam in glittering blue eyes.  
但再说，他不能这样做，对吧？不是那个人类，如果他想活着看到另一天的话。如果他公然违抗地狱的意愿，他们会追捕他，尽管恶魔有时候令人沮丧，但克劳利无法想象一个没有他的世界，没有他的笑声、胡闹和那双闪烁着蓝色光芒的调皮眼睛。

Crowley rocked back and forth, staring at his notes.  
克劳利来回晃动着身体，盯着他的笔记。

Killing the Antichrist would be _good_. It would prevent Armageddon. Stop the war. Prevent… all of it from coming to pass. Surely, that _had_ to be the good and right thing to do? Which meant that, of course, Heaven would approve. It would mean winning without the need for battle and that had to be better for everyone.  
杀死反基督者是好事。这将阻止末日战争的发生。停止战争。阻止...所有这一切的发生。毫无疑问，这一定是正确的事情，对吗？这意味着，当然，天堂会赞同。这将意味着不需要战斗就能取得胜利，这对每个人来说都更好。

Maybe if he told them, then they could find someone to do the… dealing with. Sandalphon, maybe. He had no qualms about killing people, even children. He could… do that bit and everything would be fine.  
也许如果他告诉他们，他们就可以找到人来处理这个事情。也许是桑达尔冯。他对杀人，甚至是孩子，毫不犹豫。他可以…做那一部分，一切都会好起来。

He dropped his head back on the seat of the couch. “What do you want me to do?” he pleaded. “Can’t you tell me? Just for once? How can I help them? How can I _save_ them?” He forced himself up, onto the couch. “Come on! Please! You said you loved them! Why would you let this happen, if you loved them?”  
他把头往后靠在沙发座位上。“你想让我怎么做？”他恳求道。“难道你不能告诉我吗？就这一次可以吗？我该如何帮助他们？我该如何拯救他们？”他强迫自己坐起来，坐在沙发上。“拜托！求求你！你说过你爱他们！如果你爱他们，为什么会让这种事情发生？”

As always, there was only ineffable silence.  
一如既往，只有难以言喻的寂静。

Crowley’s shoulders sagged and he bowed over his knees. It looked, he thought miserably, like he had no other choice.  
克劳利的肩膀耷拉下来，他低头弯腰。他想，这看起来真是可怜，好像他别无选择。

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Aziraphale was worried. 亚齐拉费尔很担心。

Not that he showed it, naturally. What would the world be coming to if a _demon_ was anxious? No, he smiled as much as usual as he ordered, then feigned a deep and thorough interest in his newspaper as he waited for his man to make contact.  
虽然他并没有表现出来，但这是理所当然的。如果一个恶魔焦虑起来，世界会变成什么样子呢？不，他像往常一样微笑着下了订单，然后假装对报纸深入浅出地感兴趣，等待着他的手下联系他。

But it didn’t mean he wasn’t still worrying.  
但这并不意味着他不再担心。

He’d known Crowley enough to recognise certain tones in his voice and the way he froze up and went quiet. Usually, the poor little thing’s mind was working in overdrive, thinking in a dozen directions at once, and quite often none of them good.  
他对克劳利的了解足以让他辨认出声音中的某些语调，以及他突然停下来变得安静的方式。通常，这个可怜的小家伙的脑子一直在高速运转，同时思考着十几个方向，而且往往没有一个是好的。

He turned a page as a shadow stretched over the table, loitering with a scent of cheap tobacco and poor hygiene. As usual, the man had attempted to douse the scent with an aftershave even cheaper than his tobacco.  
当一道阴影在桌子上伸展开来时，他翻了一页，带着一股廉价烟草和不良卫生的气味徘徊。和往常一样，这个人试图用一种比他的烟草更便宜的须后水来掩盖这股气味。

“Sergeant Shadwell.” He folded the paper when the waiter approached and raised a brow at the Witchfinder.  
“沙德韦尔中士。”当服务员走过来时，他折叠起纸张，对着巫术调查员挑了挑眉毛。

Shadwell made a little half-bow, slipping into the opposite seat. “Mr. Fell, sir,” he said respectfully. “You’re looking well.”  
沙德威尔微微鞠了一下躬，滑入对面的座位上。“费尔先生，您好，”他恭敬地说道。“您看起来很不错。”

“Mm. Healthy diet and exercise,” Aziraphale murmured over the largest, most perfectly fried breakfast a man could ask for.  
“嗯，健康的饮食和锻炼。”阿齐拉费尔低声说着，面前摆着一份最大最完美的炸早餐，这是一个人所能期望的。

“And your… er… your father? You look very much like him.”  
“还有你的……嗯……你父亲呢？你长得很像他。”

That, Aziraphale thought with mild amusement, was one of the failings in the poor man’s perception. He was absolutely convinced that the Mr. Fell he met in the bookshop was… for want of a less-offensive term, a confirmed bachelor, and yet given the explanation that he had a son to carry on his business, Shadwell had grasped it and clung onto it with both hands.  
阿齐拉费尔微笑着想，这正是这可怜人感知力的一个缺陷。他坚信在书店里遇到的费尔先生……姑且不说什么冒犯的词，是个已经确认的单身汉，然而当沙德威尔听到他有个儿子来继承生意的解释后，他立刻明白了，并紧紧抓住这个解释。

“Mm.” Aziraphale added some ketchup to his fried eggs. It was hardly culinary excellence, but sometimes, one simply needed to indulge in hearty, greasy comfort food.  
“嗯。”亚齐拉菲尔在他的煎蛋上加了一些番茄酱。这并不是什么烹饪上的杰作，但有时候，人们只是需要沉溺于美味、油腻的舒适食物中。

“Um. I’ve prepared the ledger,” Shadwell said, setting a raggedy cashbook on the table. “The men need paying, your honour. It’s hard times for witchfinders in today’s degenerate age…”  
“嗯，我准备好账簿了。”沙德维尔说着，将一本破旧的账本放在桌子上。“先生，工人们需要发工资。在这个堕落的时代，对于巫师猎人来说，日子可不好过啊…”

Aziraphale waved it away with a sausage and bean-laden fork. “Unnecessary, my dear. The money will be dropped in on Saturday. Two-hundred and fifty pounds, as per the arrangement.”  
亚齐拉费尔挥了挥手，手上还握着一叉子上堆满香肠和豆子。“不必了，亲爱的。钱将在星期六送来。按照约定，是两百五十英镑。”

“Only cash!” Shadwell reared back in his seat when Aziraphale glanced at him. “Don’t take plastic!”  
“只收现金！”当阿齐拉费尔看向沙德维尔时，他在座位上退后了一下。“不接受信用卡！”

Aziraphale gazed at him, chewing ponderously.  
亚齐拉费尔凝视着他，沉思地咀嚼着。

“Um… so… your Lordship… you called…?”  
“嗯...那个...大人...您叫...？”

“Mm.” Aziraphale dabbed at his lip with a napkin and set down his fork. “There’s a village called Tadfield in Oxfordshire. I need your best people put on it. They’ll be looking for a particular boy, around eleven years of age and… perhaps… unusual elements about him.”  
“嗯。”亚齐拉费尔用餐巾轻轻擦了擦嘴唇，放下叉子。“牛津郡有个叫塔德菲尔德的村庄。我需要你们最好的人去调查一下。他们会寻找一个大约十一岁左右的男孩，可能...有一些不寻常的特点。”

“He’s a–” Shadwell glanced around, then leaned closer. “Is he a witch?”  
“他是一-” 谢德威尔环顾四周，然后靠近一些。“他是巫师吗？”

Well, Aziraphale though dryly, needs must. “Perhaps, my dear.” He skewered another of the sausages, deliberately nibbling on the end, enough to make the witchfinder lower his eyes and clear his throat. “You’d have to find him first to be sure.”  
阿齐拉费尔干巴巴地说道：“也许吧，亲爱的。”他又串起了一根香肠，故意咬了一口尖端，足以让巫术追寻者低下头，清了清嗓子。“要确定的话，你得先找到他。”

“Aye,” Shadwell grunted in agreement. “Well… my best operative…”  
“嗯，”沙德威尔同意地咕哝道。“嗯...我的最佳特工...”

The sour stench of body odour, cheap aftershave and tobacco was only adding to the worry-wrought nausea and Aziraphale pushed his plate back. “Very good, sergeant,” he said, striding from the café without looking back, and into the marginally fresher air of the city.  
酸臭的体味、廉价的须后水和烟草的气味只会加剧阿齐拉费尔的焦虑和恶心感，他把盘子推开了。“干得好，警官，”他说着，毫不回头地离开咖啡馆，走进稍微清新一些的城市空气中。

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Crowley fidgeted uncomfortably.  
克劳利感到不安地坐立不安。

For once, he’d dug out his more formal clothing, a black suit he’d bought years ago. The moths had got into the last of his decent shirts, so he’d resorted to a plain grey t-shirt under it and the cleanest of his dozens of pairs of trainers. Best he had to offer and he still felt like a beggar standing by the door of a tube station, waiting for a hint of compassion.  
这一次，他翻出了自己多年前买的一套正式的黑色西装。飞蛾已经侵入了他最后一件体面的衬衫，所以他只好在西装下穿了一件普通的灰色T恤，并选择了自己几十双鞋中最干净的一双运动鞋。这是他能提供的最好的，但他仍然感觉自己像是站在地铁站门口的乞丐，等待一丝同情。

Heaven was as cold and quiet and vast as he remembered and he hastily shoved his hands in his pockets to keep from picking at his nails as he waited.  
天空冷静而广阔，就像他记忆中的那样。他急忙把手插进口袋，以免等待时乱弄指甲。

“So!” Gabriel’s voice boomed through the space around him and he spun around to find the Archangel marching towards him, followed by Michael, Uriel and Sandalphon. “I got your message. You’ve got something big?” Gabriel spread his hands. “Lay it on us?”  
“嘿！”加百列的声音在他周围的空间中回荡，他转身发现大天使正朝他走来，后面跟着迈克尔、乌列尔和桑达尔芬。“我收到了你的信息。你有什么重要的事情？”加百列伸开双手。“告诉我们吧？”

It was _stupid_. No matter how many times he came. No matter how many times he saw them. No matter how much time passed, he still felt the weight of their disapproval and impatience every single time. They didn’t have any right or reason to think less of him now, not after so long, not after the Almighty had given her blessing to–  
这真是愚蠢。无论他来了多少次。无论他见过他们多少次。无论时间过去了多久，每一次他都能感受到他们的不赞同和不耐烦的压力。他们没有任何权利或理由现在对他有所指责，尤其是在这么长时间过去之后，尤其是在全能者已经给予她祝福之后。

“What’s happening?” Uriel snapped, shaking him out of his thoughts.  
“发生了什么事？”乌里尔厉声问道，把他从思绪中惊醒。

All of them were looking at him and his words felt like they had caught in his throat.  
所有人都看着他，他的话感觉像是卡在了喉咙里。

“So. Um. Well…” He tightened his hands into fists and took a steadying breath. “It’s about the Antichrist.”  
“嗯，呃，嗯……”他紧握双拳，深吸一口气稳住自己。“这事跟反基督有关。”

“Yes?” Uriel raised their eyebrows.  
"是吗？" Uriel挑起了他们的眉毛。

“I-I’ve been– there’s been–” Crowley shifted from foot to foot. “The thing is… I think… the other side might have lost him.”   
“我-我一直-发生了-” 克劳利不停地踱来踱去。“问题是...我觉得...另一边可能把他弄丢了。”

The Archangels exchanged looks. “The… other side?” Michael said.  
大天使们互相对视了一眼。“另一边？”迈克尔说道。

Crowley stared at them in confusion. They’d always been going on about it. Who else could he possibly be talking about? Heaven. Hell. The opposition, the enemies, the adversaries? “You know?” he said, pointing downwards. “_Them_?”  
克劳利困惑地盯着他们看。他们一直在谈论这个。他还能指的是谁呢？天堂。地狱。对立面，敌人，对手？“你知道吗？”他指着下方说。“他们？”

“Lost him?” Gabriel said, face twisted sceptically. “He’s the son of the US Ambassador. He’s under constant surveillance.”  
“丢了他？”加布里埃尔怀疑地扭曲着脸说道。“他是美国大使的儿子。他一直处于监视之下。”

“The other side,” Michael added dismissively, “are currently transporting him to the Plains of Megiddo. Apparently, that’s the traditional starting point.”  
“另一方面，”迈克尔不屑地补充道，“他们正在将他运送到梅吉多平原。显然，那是传统的起点。”

Gabriel nodded. “Middle Eastern unrest and everything else just follows. The four Horsemen ride out. The last great battle between Heaven and Hell.”  
加布里埃尔点了点头。“中东动荡，其他一切都会随之而来。四骑士出征。天堂与地狱之间的最后一场伟大战斗。”

Crowley forced himself not to nod along and just go with what they were saying. “Thing is…” He paused, looking down at his feet. His shoes looked grubby against Heaven’s pristine, polished white floors. God, how did he think he could ever come up here and argue his case. He dug his nails into his hands and looked up at them. “Thing is I don’t think he’s the Antichrist. I don’t know if it’s a trick or what, but the… actual Antichrist isn’t… him. He’s… he might be… somewhere else.”  
克劳利强迫自己不要点头附和，只是随着他们的说法。"问题是..."他停顿了一下，低头看着自己的脚。他的鞋子在天堂那洁白、抛光的地板上显得肮脏。天啊，他怎么能想到自己能上来这里辩论自己的案子。他用指甲抠着手，抬头看着他们。“问题是，我不认为他是那个敌基督。我不知道这是不是一个诡计，但是...真正的敌基督不是他。他...可能在别的地方。”

Four pairs of eyes stared at him and God, he wanted to curl in on himself and back out of their presence and flee back to the safe warmth of his home. They didn’t care what he had to say. They didn’t want to know what he had to say. Why, why, why had he come to them when they clearly thought he was as worthless as the scruffy trainers he was wearing?  
四双眼睛盯着他，天哪，他想蜷缩起来，逃离他们的视线，回到温暖安全的家中。他们不在乎他要说什么。他们不想知道他要说什么。为什么，为什么，为什么他要来找他们，当他们明显认为他和他穿的那双破旧的运动鞋一样毫无价值？

“Where?” Gabriel demanded, voice clipped and impatient.  
“在哪里？”加布里埃尔不耐烦地要求道，语气干脆利落。

Tadfield. 塔德菲尔德。

That was all he had to say. All he had to do was give them the answer, but they didn’t believe him now. Why would they believe him if he gave the boy’s name and town? And if he did, how could he be sure they would do… oh. Oh, there was a way he could test the waters, even if it meant a small delay. Surely, that would…  
那就是他要说的全部。他只需要给出答案，但他们现在不相信他。如果他给出男孩的名字和城镇，他们为什么会相信他呢？而且如果他这样做了，他怎么能确定他们会做...哦。哦，有一种方法可以试探一下，即使这意味着稍微拖延一下。肯定，那会...

“Um.” He swallowed hard. “Not sure. I-I-I mean I could find out. Probably. Maybe. I’ve got people. You know. Humans. And things.” He managed a brittle smile. “I mean, hypothetically, if I was able to find him…” He trailed off, praying that one of them would offer, one of them would suggest, one of them would do what he knew he couldn’t.  
“嗯。”他吞了口唾沫。“不确定。我-我-我的意思是我可以查到。可能吧。也许。我有人。你懂的。人类。还有其他东西。”他勉强笑了笑。“我是说，假设我能找到他的话……”他停顿了下来，祈祷其中一个人会提供帮助，其中一个人会建议，其中一个人会做他知道自己做不到的事情。

“It wouldn’t change anything, Raziel,” Uriel said dismissively and his heart dropped like a rock.  
"这不会改变任何事情，Raziel，" Uriel 不屑地说道，他的心像一块石头一样沉了下去。

“There was war in Heaven long before the earth was created,” Gabriel added placidly. “Lucifer and his people were cast out, but nothing was really… settled.”  
“在地球诞生之前，天堂就发生了一场战争。”加百列平静地补充道，“路西法和他的人被驱逐出去，但事实上，一切都没有真正…解决。”

“I suppose it wasn’t,” he said weakly. God, he shouldn’t have come. He should’ve known. They had tunnel vision about Heaven and Hell. Always had. The earth didn’t even come into it for them, did it? They didn’t even care. “But… there doesn’t have to be another war, does there?”  
“我想是这样的。”他虚弱地说道。天啊，他不应该来的。他早该知道的。他们对天堂和地狱有着狭隘的视野。一直都是这样。地球对他们来说根本无关紧要，不是吗？他们甚至不在乎。“但是...难道还会有另一场战争吗？”

“As much as we appreciate your hypotheticals, Raziel, I’m afraid we have other things to do,” Gabriel said with a strained smile. “The earth isn’t just going to end itself you know.”  
“虽然我们很感激你的假设问题，Raziel，但恐怕我们还有其他事情要做。”加百列勉强地笑着说道，“地球可不会自己毁灭的。”

Crowley wanted to speak. He wanted to scream. He wanted to do anything but nod and duck his head away from their judgemental stares, and wait until they all walked away, leaving him alone in the chilly hallways, his nails carving blood into his palms.  
克劳利想要说话。他想要尖叫。他想要做任何事情，只是不想点头低下头躲避他们带有审判目光的注视，然后等待他们都走开，让他独自留在寒冷的走廊里，指甲刻进掌心，鲜血淋漓。

He took the staircase back down to the streets, then hurried out and away from the building as fast as he could.  
他沿着楼梯走回到街上，然后尽快地匆匆离开了建筑物。

Heaven weren’t going to do anything and he _couldn’t_ let Aziraphale get himself in trouble – which, of course, he would if he knew exactly what was going on – so that only left the human option. He dug out his phone and ducked into a doorway, calling up the number of the one human he knew would be willing to hunt down a supernatural force.  
天堂不会采取任何行动，他不能让阿齐拉费尔陷入麻烦——当然，如果他知道发生了什么事情，他肯定会这样做——所以只剩下人类的选择了。他掏出手机，躲进门口，拨通了一个他知道愿意追踪超自然力量的人类的电话号码。

Shadwell’s secretary put him through to the man and Crowley sagged with relief. “Sergeant Shadwell! It’s…” He glanced out into the street, checking for any angelic surveillance. “It’s you-know-who.”  
沙德威尔的秘书把他接通给了那个人，克劳利如释重负地松了口气。“沙德威尔警官！是……”他瞥了一眼街上，检查是否有任何天使监视。“是你知道的那个人。”

“Who?” “谁？”

Crowley groaned inwardly. “Me!” he exclaimed, rocking on the balls of his feet. “Your… sponsor. Listen, do you have any men free? I’ve got a mission for them.”  
克劳利内心不禁叹息。"我！"他大声说道，踮起脚尖晃动着。"你的...赞助商。听着，你手下有没有人空闲？我有一个任务要交给他们。"

“A mission?” Shadwell sounded bemused. “Like a church with a sing-song?”  
“任务？”沙德维尔听起来有些困惑。“像个唱歌的教堂一样？”

“No!” Crowley snapped impatiently. “A job! I need them to get to Tadfield. It’s a town in Oxfordshire and there’s a boy there that we need to get eyes on as soon as possible. I need to know where he is, what he’s doing, the lot.”  
“不！”克劳利不耐烦地急切地说道。“是工作！我需要他们去塔德菲尔德。那是牛津郡的一个小镇，那里有个男孩，我们需要尽快监视他。我需要知道他在哪里，他在做什么，全部都要知道。”

Shadwell grunt. “I’ll put a squad of my best men on it.”  
沙德维尔咕哝道：“我会派一队我最好的人去处理这件事。”

Crowley nodded, releasing a shaking breath. “Good, great, perfect.”  
克劳利点了点头，放松地呼出一口颤抖的气息。“好的，太棒了，完美。”

“And I’ll be by the kirk next week to pick up your annual dues,” Shadwell said quickly.  
“下周我会去教堂取你的年费。”沙德维尔迅速说道。

“Yeah, yeah, fine.” Crowley groped in his pocket. “But your people to Tadfield first, all right, and keep them there until I call, okay?” He pulled out his notebook. “Right. Have you got a pen?”  
“好的，好的，行。” 克劳利在口袋里摸索着。“但是你的人先去塔德菲尔德，好吗？并且在我打电话之前一直待在那里，可以吗？” 他拿出笔记本。“好的。你有笔吗？”

“Aye.” “好的。”

“The boy’s called Adam Young,” Crowley said, darting another wary glance into the street. “And he lives at 4 Hogback Lane. Got it?”  
“那个男孩叫亚当·杨，”克劳利说着，又警惕地瞥了一眼街道。“他住在猪背巷4号。明白了吗？”

“Absolutely, your honour,” Shadwell confirmed. “Tadfield it is.”  
“当然，阁下，”沙德维尔确认道。“就是塔德菲尔德。”

“Great! Thank you!” He shoved the notebook back in his pocket. “Let me know when they’re there, all right?” He ended the call and sagged back against the damp wall of the doorframe. Well, he’d done what he could. He’d tried Heaven and now, all he could do was trust in the humans to help him save them. And if that failed, then…  
“太好了！谢谢！”他把笔记本塞回口袋里。“他们到了的时候告诉我，好吗？”他挂断电话，无力地靠在门框上潮湿的墙上。他已经尽力了。他曾试过求助天堂，现在他只能相信人类能帮他拯救他们。如果这一切失败了，那么……

Then he knew which side of the breach he had to stand on as the world – his world – fell apart.  
然后他知道他必须站在哪一边，当这个世界——他的世界——分崩离析的时候。

The search was not – by any vague estimates of the word – going well.  
搜索结果并不好，无论用任何模糊的估计来说。

Aziraphale had scanned through reams of newspapers in case of any… unusual occurrences, but nothing had jumped out. Which was ridiculous, given that the boy had his powers now. There ought to have been something, some hint or a clue of something rotten in the county of Oxfordshire.  
亚齐拉费尔已经浏览了一大堆报纸，以防万一出现什么异常情况，但什么也没有引起他的注意。这太荒谬了，考虑到那个男孩现在拥有了他的力量。应该有些线索，或者牛津郡有什么腐朽的迹象。

He’d even risked venturing onto the… internet in case anything had come up there, but no. The most exciting event was a bake-sale happening in St. Clarence’s parish, which – while tempting – was also not in the least unnatural.  
他甚至冒险上网查看是否有任何新消息，但是没有。最令人兴奋的事情是圣克拉伦斯教区的一次烘焙义卖活动，虽然很诱人，但也毫不奇怪。

There had been no word from Crowley all day and he had to admit he was beginning to worry. The angel always tied himself in knots about the least little thing and this? Well, this was a substantial little thing to say the least. Crowley had been lying the last time they spoke, he could tell that much, which meant the only way to check on him was to see him.  
整天都没有收到克劳利的消息，他不得不承认自己开始担心了。这个天使总是为了一点小事而束手束脚，而这次呢？嗯，这可是相当重要的小事了。克劳利在他们上次交谈时撒了谎，他能感觉得到，这意味着唯一能确认他情况的方法就是亲自见他一面。

He dialled the angel’s number, utterly unsurprised when he picked up after a single ring. “Meet me at the third alternate rendezvous.”  
他拨通了天使的号码，一声铃响后，他毫不惊讶地听到对方接起电话。“在第三个备用约会地点见我。”

“What?” Lord, the poor thing sounded utterly dazed. “Oh. Right. Yeah. Which one is that again?”🔄  ❓  
“什么？”大人，可怜的家伙听起来完全迷茫。“哦。对了。是的。那个是哪一个来着？”

“The bandstand, my dear,” Aziraphale said as gently as he could. “Fifteen minutes, all right?”  
“亲爱的，乐队亭子，”亚齐拉费尔尽量温柔地说道。“十五分钟，好吗？”

“Yeah. Yeah, fine.” “是的。是的，没问题。”

 Aziraphale frowned at his telephone, then hung up the receiver. It wasn’t like the angel to be so abrupt, but then, these weren’t entirely normal times.  
亚齐拉费尔皱了皱眉头，然后挂断了电话。天使的举止并不像这样突然，但这毕竟不是完全正常的时期。

He was at the bandstand less than ten minutes later, pacing in circles as he waited for the angel, and when he saw him, his heart sank. Crowley was wearing one of his black suits, which could only mean he had been called in on Heavenly business, which didn’t bode well.  
不到十分钟后，他来到了音乐亭，焦急地在圆圈里踱步，等待着那位天使的到来。当他看到他时，他的心沉了下去。克劳利穿着他的一套黑色西装，这意味着他被天堂的事务召唤了，这可不是个好兆头。

“Any news?” he asked, as soon as the angel reached him.  
“有什么消息吗？”他一见天使就问道。

“What?” Crowley pushed his fingers through his hair, clearly upset. “What kind of news?”  
“什么？”克劳利用手指揉了揉头发，显然很不高兴。“什么样的消息？”

“About the Antichrist, my dear?” Aziraphale approached him cautiously. Lord, he looked as if he might run at the slightest provocation. “Have you found anything that might let us know where he is?”  
“关于那个敌基督，亲爱的？”亚齐拉费尔小心翼翼地走近他。天啊，他看起来好像一点刺激就会逃跑。"你找到了什么线索，让我们知道他在哪里吗？"

The wild, panicked look in the angel’s eyes told him things were worse than he knew. “I– it– I’m–”  
天使眼中的野性和恐慌的表情告诉他情况比他所知道的更糟糕。“我——它——我——”

“Me either,” Aziraphale assured him, holding up both hands. “Breathe, my dear. You look like you might keel over.”  
“我也是，”亚齐拉费尔向他保证，双手举起。“深呼吸，亲爱的。你看起来好像要晕倒了。”

Crowley backed away a step, hands up defensively, which froze Aziraphale in his tracks. The angel had never, not once in their millennia of friendship, recoiled from him like that. “I’m _fine_,” the angel lied, the tang of it bitter and sharp. “I _am_. I’m just–” His lips twitched, but it didn’t make it as far as a smile. “It’s the great plan, isn’t it? We– we’re just part of it.”  
克劳利退了一步，举起双手做出防御的姿势，这让阿齐拉费尔停住了脚步。在他们千年的友谊中，天使从未像这样对他退缩过。“我没事，”天使撒了个谎，带着一丝苦涩和尖锐。“我没事。只是……”他的嘴唇抽动了一下，但并没有展露出笑容。“这就是伟大的计划，对吧？我们——我们只是其中的一部分。”

Aziraphale’s heart sank. Back, toeing the party line. Whatever the Hell had happened to the angel during the day, it had shaken him up. “They can shove the Great Plan up their collective arses,” he snarled angrily. “Until they choke on it.”  
亚齐拉费尔的心沉了下去。回到了团队的立场。不管在白天发生了什么，那让他感到不安。他愤怒地咆哮道：“他们可以把伟大计划塞进他们集体的屁股里，直到他们被它噎住。”

Crowley’s face crumpled in distress. “May you be forgiven.”  
克劳利的脸上露出了痛苦的表情。“愿你得到宽恕。”

Aziraphale stared at him in disbelief. “Oh, we know that won’t happen, my dear,” he said, shaking his head. “Not ever. It’s what I am, remember: an unforgiveable demon.”  
亚齐拉费尔怀疑地盯着他。“哦，亲爱的，我们都知道那是不可能的。”他摇了摇头。“永远不会发生。记住，这就是我，一个不可饶恕的恶魔。”

“But you–” Crowley’s voice broke. “You were an angel once.”  
“但是你——” 克劳利的声音戛然而止。“你曾经是个天使。”

The implication hung in the air between them, as if he might miraculous turn back into one. Or, Aziraphale realised with horror and dismay, as if he would be on the same side as him when the time came. They wouldn’t be. They could never be. Even if he could, how could he willingly return to the place that had cast him out? How could the angel think he would?  
暗示在他们之间悬浮着，仿佛他可能会奇迹般地变回一个人。或者，阿齐拉费尔恐惧和沮丧地意识到，当时机到来时，他们会站在同一边。但他们不会。他们永远不可能。即使他能够，他又怎么可能自愿回到那个把他驱逐出去的地方呢？天使怎么会认为他会这样做呢？

“That was a long time ago, Crowley,” he said, shaking his head. He closed the distance between them, reaching out to steady the angel, but forcing his hands back, down away from him. “We’ll find the boy. My people can do it.”  
“那是很久以前的事了，克劳利，”他摇了摇头说道。他拉近了他们之间的距离，伸手去稳住天使，但又强迫自己把手放回身后，远离他。“我们会找到那个孩子的。我的人可以办到。”

Crowley’s eyes were too bright. “And then what? We… kill him?”  
克劳利的眼睛闪烁着过于明亮的光芒。“然后呢？我们……杀了他？”

“Someone can,” Aziraphale replied, trying not to meet his eyes, trying not to let himself become distracted by the pain there. It would only make him too angry. “I mean, not one of us, if we can help it, but if needs must…”  
“有人可以。”亚齐拉费尔回答道，努力不去看他的眼睛，努力不让自己被那里的痛苦分散注意力。这只会让他太生气。“我的意思是，我们中的任何一个人都不愿意，如果有必要的话……”

“Needs must…” Crowley reached out, then recoiled, turning away and walking in one of those tight narrow circles he made for himself when he was afraid and thinking too hard. “I– we– there must be some other way.”  
“情况所迫……” 克劳利伸出手，然后退缩了，转身走开，在他害怕和思考过度时，他总是走这样紧张而狭窄的圈子。“我——我们——一定还有其他办法。”

“Like what?” Aziraphale demanded, throwing up his hands. “I have no idea what else we can do! I’ve looked! And now, you’re lying to me about something and talking about sides and what the Hell do you expect me to think?”  
“像什么？”亚齐拉费尔气愤地举起双手说道。“我不知道我们还能做什么！我已经找过了！现在，你还对我撒谎，谈论着立场，你到底希望我怎么想？”

Crowley spun back to face him. “I _want_ to stop it!”  
克劳利转身面对他。“我想要阻止它！”

“I know you do, but I’m telling you I have no idea _how_!” The demon took breath, pressing his fingertips to his lips and exhaling. “What do you know, angel? I know you’re keeping something from me. You know you can tell me anything. You _know_ that.”  
“我知道你这么认为，但我告诉你我完全不知道该怎么做！”恶魔深吸一口气，用指尖捂住嘴唇，呼出一口气。“你知道什么，天使？我知道你对我隐瞒了些什么。你知道你可以告诉我任何事情。你知道的。”

Crowley’s dark eyes darted wildly around, as if he could find the answer, nothing but strangled sounds escaping him.  
克劳利的深邃眼眸疯狂地四处扫视，仿佛他能找到答案，却只有被扼住的声音逃离他的嘴唇。

It was like a blow, the silence.  
它就像一记重击，那份寂静。

“Very good,” Aziraphale said as calmly as he could. “This is pointless. I’ll be off.”  
“太好了，”亚齐拉费尔尽量保持冷静地说道。“这毫无意义。我要走了。”

He was on the steps when Crowley’s choked voice reached him. “You can’t leave, Aziraphale. There– there’s nowhere to go.”  
当克劳利嘶哑的声音传到他耳中时，他正站在台阶上。“你不能走，阿齐拉费尔。这里...这里没有地方可去。”

He paused, hand on the rail of the bandstand, then turned and looked back. Back at the angel who had become the gyroscope about which his world had come to turn. “There’s everywhere to go, my dear,” he said, trying to keep his own voice from faltering. “Even if we lose the earth, we can find somewhere else, somewhere…” He waved skywards, where the stars were only just beginning to appear. “Somewhere together.”  
他停下来，手放在音乐亭的栏杆上，然后转身回头看着。回头看着那个成为他世界中心的天使陀螺。"亲爱的，我们有无尽的去处，"他说着，试图让自己的声音不颤抖。"即使我们失去了地球，我们还可以找到其他地方，某个地方..."他向天空挥手，那里的星星刚刚开始出现。"某个地方，我们一起去。"

“Together?” Crowley pressed his hands together as if in prayer, knocking his fingers to his forehead. “No, Aziraphale, no…”  
“一起？”克劳利将双手合十，仿佛在祈祷一般，用手指敲击着自己的额头。“不，阿齐拉费尔，不要……”

“Darling, think how long we’ve been friends,” Aziraphale said softly.  
“亲爱的，想想我们已经是多年的朋友了。”阿齐拉费尔轻声说道。

“We– we’re _not_ friends.” Crowley backed away, still not looking to him, the lie sharp in the air. “I’m an angel, you’re a demon. We _can’t_ be friends!”  
“我们——我们不是朋友。”克劳利退后了一步，仍然不敢看他，谎言在空气中刺耳。“我是一个天使，你是一个恶魔。我们不能成为朋友！”

“Of course we can,” Aziraphale moved towards him, hand outstretched.  
“当然可以。”亚齐拉费尔朝他走去，伸出手。

“No, no, no…” Crowley shook his head. “Look– look, even if I _did_ know where he is, I couldn’t_– wouldn’t –_ tell you!” He met Aziraphale’s eyes, his expression bleak and his eyes so wet it was astonishing that his face was still dry. “It’s too late now. We’re on opposite sides!”  
“不，不，不……” 克劳利摇了摇头。“你看——你看，即使我知道他在哪里，我也不能——也不会——告诉你！”他与阿齐拉费尔对视，表情凄凉，眼睛湿润得令人惊讶他的脸还是干燥的。“现在已经太晚了。我们站在对立的阵营！”

“Oh, darling,” Aziraphale caught Crowley’s cheek in his hand. “We’re on _our_ side! We always have been.”  
“哦，亲爱的，”亚齐拉费尔用手抚摸着克劳利的脸颊。“我们是同一方的！一直都是。”

Crowley shoved his hand away, backstepping. “There’s _no_ our side!” he exclaimed. “There can’t be! We have to _stop_ this now.”  
克劳利推开他的手，向后退了一步。“没有我们的一方！”他大声说道。“不可能有！我们必须立即停止这一切。”

Aziraphale felt as if he had been doused in holy water, his hand falling down by his side. “Oh. I. I see.” He bowed his head as politely as he could, his whole body twisting in on itself, his hands curling into agonising knots by his side. “If that is what you want. Very well.” He smiled, thin and tight until it made his face ache. “Good day.”  
亚齐拉费尔感觉自己仿佛被圣水浇灌，手无力地垂落在身旁。“哦，我，我明白了。”他尽可能客气地低下头，整个身体扭曲在一起，双手紧紧地扭成痛苦的结。他微微一笑，脸上的表情显得苍白而紧绷，“祝您愉快。”

He turned and walked away, his steps leaden, and tried to ignore the catch in the angel’s breath, the short, sharp bitten-off sob.  
他转身离开，步伐沉重，试图忽略天使呼吸中的窒息感，以及那短促、尖锐的抽泣声。

So, he thought as he walked alone into the twilight, this was what the end of the world felt like.  
他独自走进黄昏，心想这就是世界末日的感觉。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

It was happening. 正在发生。

It was already happening and Crowley didn’t know what to do.  
这已经在发生了，克劳利不知道该怎么办。

He’d spent the morning scouring the internet, reading the news, watching all the latest updates as they flooded in. Atlantis was there again, the kraken had risen from the deaths, the rainforests had pushed through half of downtown Rio.  
他整个上午都在网上搜索，阅读新闻，观看涌入的最新消息。亚特兰蒂斯再次出现，海怪从深海中升起，雨林已经蔓延到里约市中心的一半。

It was happening. 正在发生。

He paced in a tight circle, trying very hard not to look further up the path. Why Gabriel insisted on jogging here, he didn’t know, especially not so close to… to, well, there. The band stand. The place where he couldn’t help feeling he’d made the biggest mistake of his life, which was really saying something given his past experience.  
他在一个狭小的圈子里来回踱步，努力不去看向路径的更远处。加布里埃尔为什么坚持要在这里慢跑，他不知道，尤其是离那个地方这么近……那个乐队亭。他无法不感到自己犯下了一生中最大的错误，考虑到他过去的经历，这可真是说得上什么了。

He turned at the pounding of running feet, his heart clenching at the sight of Gabriel. He raised his hand in greeting, but the Archangel didn’t even give him a second look.  
他听到奔跑的脚步声转过身来，看到加百列的身影，心中一紧。他举起手打招呼，但大天使甚至没有看他一眼。

“Gabriel!” He ran after him on legs that felt too unsteady to do the job. “Gabriel! It’s me!”  
“加布里埃尔！”他追着他跑，腿感觉不稳定，无法完成任务。“加布里埃尔！是我！”

“I know it’s you, Raziel,” Gabriel said coolly, not even breaking pace or anything, the bastard.  
“我知道是你，Raziel。”加百列冷冷地说道，甚至没有停下脚步，这个混蛋。

“I’ve discovered some prophecies,” Crowley said, trying his best to keep up with him. “Accurate ones.”  
“我发现了一些预言，”克劳利尽力跟上他的节奏说道。“准确的预言。”

Gabriel shrugged. “What’s in human prophecies that matters to us?”  
加布里埃尔耸耸肩。“人类的预言对我们有什么重要性呢？”

“S’all over the news today!” Crowley exclaimed, jogging a few steps faster to try and match the Archangel’s longer strides. “Everything that’s happening! It’s all about Armageddon and it’s starting today!”  
“今天新闻上都在报道！”克劳利大声说道，加快了几步脚步，试图赶上大天使更长的步伐。“所有正在发生的事情！都是关于末日的，而且今天就开始了！”

“Exactly. Right on schedule. “The Archangel gave him such an impatient look that Crowley was almost tempted to smack him. “What’s your point?”  
“没错，正如计划中的一样。”大天使不耐烦地瞪了他一眼，让克劳利几乎有冲动要打他。“你的意思是什么？”

Crowley grabbed his sleeve. “Look, please, stop,” he panted. “Just for a minute.”  
克劳利抓住他的袖子。“看，拜托，停下来，”他喘着气说。“就一分钟。”

Gabriel sighed impatiently, but at least he stopped and Crowley staggered to a halt, clutching his chest. “Well?” the Archangel demanded.  
加百列不耐烦地叹了口气，但至少他停下来了，克劳利也摇摇晃晃地停了下来，抱着胸口。大天使问道：“怎么样？”

Crowley rubbed his chest. “I just–” God, the instinct to not question them, to just go with it was overwhelming, but it was coming and it was real and he _had_ to do something. “Isn’t there something we can do?”  
克劳利揉了揉胸口。“我只是——”天啊，不去质疑他们的本能，只是随波逐流的冲动压倒一切，但现实正在来临，他必须采取行动。“难道我们没有办法做些什么吗？”

“There is!” Gabriel said, giving him a firm slap on the shoulder. “We can fight! And we can win.”  
“有！”加布里埃尔说着，用力拍了拍他的肩膀。“我们可以战斗！我们可以赢。”

Crowley stared at him helplessly, remember blood and screams and hellfire and brimstone and the sight of thousands of his brothers Falling. “But there doesn’t have to be a war,” he pleaded. “Not again.”  
克劳利无助地盯着他，回忆起血腥、尖叫、地狱之火和硫磺的景象，以及成千上万的兄弟堕落的景象。“但是我们不必再次开战，”他恳求道。

“Of course there does,” Gabriel said, looking at him as if he was an idiot. “Otherwise, how would we win it?” He took Raziel by the shoulders. “Now, look, wrap up whatever you need to wrap up down here, report back to active service and…” He looked Crowley up and down, disapproval all over his face. “And maybe try to _look_ like a decent angel?”  
“当然有啊，”加百列说着，看着他就像看傻瓜一样。“否则，我们怎么能赢呢？”他抓住拉齐尔的肩膀。“现在，听着，把你需要处理的事情处理好，回到现役，然后……”他审视着克劳利，脸上尽是不满。“或许试着像个体面的天使？”

Crowley found himself nodding out of habit, eyes down.  
克劳利发现自己出于习惯点头，目光低垂。

“Come on.” Gabriel clapped him hard on both arms. “Head up, Raziel! You’re a celestial warrior, aren’tcha?”  
"加油吧。”加百列用力拍了拍他的双臂。“振作起来，拉齐尔！你可是一名天界战士，对吧？”

Instinct dragged his body to attention, but as soon as Gabriel released him and jogged off, Crowley sagged, wrapping his arms around his middle. “I’m a _gardener_,” he whispered. He turned to head back towards the Bentley, recoiling when Gabriel materialised right in front of him.  
本能让他的身体警觉起来，但是当加百列放开他，跑开时，克劳利松弛下来，双臂环抱住自己的腹部。“我是个园丁，”他低声说道。他转身朝着宾利车走去，当加百列突然出现在他面前时，他吓了一跳。

“Almost forgot,” Gabriel said with a quick smile. “According to our records, you borrowed a flaming sword from one of the cherubim of Eden to drive that demon out of the garden. Leliel said they never got it back. Be sure to bring it with you.” He grinned. “You’re going to need it.”  
“差点忘了，”加百列带着一个灿烂的微笑说道。“根据我们的记录，你曾从伊甸园的其中一个基路伯那里借了一把火焰之剑，用来赶走那个恶魔。莱利尔说他们从未拿回来。记得带上它。”他咧嘴一笑。“你会需要它的。”

“Er… yeah.” Crowley forced a shaky grin. “Course. Kept it safe. In case, y’know. Humans…”  
“嗯...是的。”克劳利勉强露出一个颤抖的笑容。“当然。保持安全。以防万一，你懂的。人类...”

“Good, good.” Another bruising squeeze to his arms made him wince and the Gabriel vanished.  
“好，好。” 又一次猛烈的挤压让他痛苦地皱了皱眉，然后加百列消失了。

Crowley pressed his hands together, fighting down the urge to scream at the Heavens. Right. Okay. End of the world on its way and the sides were taking up arms. Arms he didn’t have and didn’t want to bear. He glanced upwards, hands shaking against one another. Maybe his human would get back to him soon, but if they didn’t, there was only one place left to ask.  
克劳利双手紧握在一起，强忍住对天空尖叫的冲动。好的。没问题。世界末日即将来临，各方都在武装起来。他没有武器，也不想承担这个责任。他抬头看了一眼，双手颤抖着相互摩擦。也许他的人类会很快回复他，但如果他们没有，只剩下一个地方可以询问了。

He dropped his hands to his sides, trying to breathe. Oh, going above Heaven’s commands was a bad idea. You _didn’t_ question anyone in Heaven. You definitely, totally, and seriously didn’t question anyone higher than that. Too many questions meant you doubted and if you doubted you…  
他把双手放在身旁，努力呼吸。哦，违背天命可不是个好主意。在天堂里，你不会质疑任何人。你绝对、完全、严肃地不会质疑比那更高的人。问题太多意味着你怀疑，而如果你怀疑的话...

You Fell. 你摔倒了。

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Aziraphale had returned to his bookshop after his last… meeting with Crowley.  
亚齐拉费尔与克劳利的最后一次会面后，回到了他的书店。

He’d settled into his chair with a large bottle of Scotch and had not moved from it for over twelve hours. He did not intend to move any further at all. If war was coming and there was nothing he could do to stop it, he intended to have no part in it whatsoever.  
他已经坐在椅子上，拿着一大瓶苏格兰威士忌，已经连续坐了十二个小时了。他不打算再移动一步。如果战争即将来临，而他无法阻止它，他决不参与其中。

Of course, that was all well and good to think in principle, but when one hadn’t had a decent dinner and arguments made one hungry, it made it very difficult to stay in one place and wait out the end of the world.  
当然，在原则上这样想是很好的，但是当一个人没有吃过一顿体面的晚餐，而争论又让人感到饥饿时，要待在一个地方等待世界的终结就变得非常困难。

The trouble was that even despite Crowley turning on him and the impending war, he really didn’t want it to end at all. Everything he liked was there. Everything he wanted was there. He had spent a long time cultivating some beautiful collections and now, they were going to destroy it over some war he had never wanted to be part of.  
问题在于，尽管克劳利背叛了他，战争即将爆发，但他真的不想让一切结束。他喜欢的一切都在那里。他想要的一切都在那里。他花了很长时间来培养一些美丽的收藏品，现在，他们将因为他从未想过参与的战争而摧毁它们。

Perhaps it was selfish of him to see it that way, but what could they really expect of him? They had charged him with being too indulgent to be an angel and so, he became a demon. A demon _couldn’t_ be too indulgent. If you told them they were doing something wrong, then they were clearly doing their job right and he thoroughly enjoyed that element of his work.  
或许他以那种方式看待是自私的，但他们真的能对他有什么期望呢？他们指责他过于放纵，以至于成为了恶魔。恶魔不可能过于放纵。如果你告诉他们他们做错了什么，那么显然他们在正确地做着自己的工作，而他非常享受这份工作中的这个元素。

And if he could prove Crowley wrong, then so be it.  
如果他能证明克劳利是错的，那就这样吧。

There didn’t need to be sides. There _never_ needed to be sides. Heaven and Hell could take their pettiness and their wars and their binary view of life and shove it up their collective arses for all he cared. He wanted nothing to do with either of them and he was quite sure neither of them would want anything to do with him.  
不需要有立场。从来不需要有立场。天堂和地狱可以把他们的小气、战争和对生活的二元观念都塞到他们的集体屁股里去，他一点也不在乎。他不想与他们有任何关系，而且他相信他们也不会想与他有任何关系。

Which, unfortunately, meant he needed to find something useful to do.  
不幸的是，这意味着他需要找些有用的事情去做。

He’d scoured every book on his shelves for some hint and clue. Most of the tomes were more about summoning demons, rather than driving out Antichrists. There was only one he hadn’t dared to break open yet. If prayers could burn and holy water could destroy, he could only begin to imagine what the literal word of God could do.  
他搜遍了书架上的每一本书，寻找一些线索和提示。大部分的书都更多地涉及召唤恶魔，而不是驱逐反基督者。只有一本他还不敢打开。如果祈祷能够燃烧，圣水能够毁灭，他简直无法想象上帝的真实话语能够做到什么。

Still, if there was a remote chance of finding an answer or a solution, then… She was the only one likely to have it and if She wasn’t talking, then the book was the next best thing. Her words recorded by an angel and given to mankind, then rewritten over and over by humans.  
然而，如果有一丝希望能找到答案或解决办法的话，那么...她很可能是唯一知道的人，如果她不说话，那么书就是下一个最好的选择。她的话被天使记录下来并传给人类，然后被人类一遍又一遍地重新书写。

The _Sefer Raziel HaMalakh_. _The Book of Raziel_.  
塞弗·拉齐尔·哈马拉赫。拉齐尔之书。

As far as he knew, the angel in question wasn’t in Hell. Not that any of them knew anyway. Everyone was curious about them. Someone plagiarising God’s spoken word to write a manual to help humans return to God’s grace after Eden sounded like they should’ve been cast out. But then it did sound the most idiotically angelic thing an angel could do.  
据他所知，所谓的天使并不在地狱中。不过，他们中的任何人都不知道。每个人都对他们感到好奇。有人抄袭上帝的话语，写了一本手册，帮助人类在伊甸园之后重返上帝的恩典，听起来他们应该被驱逐出去。但这听起来确实是天使能做的最愚蠢的事情。

He laid it on his work table and dug out a pair of smoked glasses and leather gloves that he always kept when venturing into the holy books.  
他把它放在工作桌上，找出了一副烟熏眼镜和皮手套，这些是他在研究圣书时一直保留的。

“Right, you bastard,” he growled, slipping the glasses on and pulling on the heavy-duty gloves. “If you’ve got anything useful to say to me, now’s the time to say it.”  
“好吧，你这个混蛋。”他咆哮着，戴上眼镜，穿上重型手套。“如果你有什么有用的话要对我说，现在就是时候了。”

He flipped open the cover and hissed through his teeth. It was like being sandblasted in the face, searing and scorching with the divine power, but mercifully not to the point of destruction. The words poured over him, words of knowledge and creation and the stars and Jesus Christ, the bugger who gave this book to the humans must have had the proverbial balls of titanium.  
他翻开书皮，咝咝地咬牙切齿。就像被面部喷砂一样，灼热而炙热，带着神圣的力量，但幸运的是没有达到毁灭的程度。这些文字涌过他，知识和创造的文字，星辰和耶稣基督的文字，把这本书给人类的那个家伙一定有着传说中的钢铁般的勇气。

There was natural biology, science, theology and… oh, there. Spells. Dozens and dozens of spells to ward of enemies and evil and demons. Binding spells. Dismissing spells. Controlling spells. All things that would probably burn his hands and tongue off if he tried them, but right now, did that really matter?  
有自然生物学、科学、神学，还有……哦，那里。咒语。数不清的咒语，用来驱散敌人、消除邪恶和恶魔。束缚咒语。解除咒语。控制咒语。这些东西如果他尝试使用，很可能会让他的手和舌头烧焦，但现在，这真的重要吗？

Dozens of pages, screeds of knowledge, and he only stopped when his eyes were aching too much to stand it anymore. He could barely read the notes he had scribbled down, the items he would need for any charms and spells and defences. He closed up the book, sealing it up and locking it away for good measure, then hurried out into the city.  
数十页纸，堆积如山的知识，直到他的眼睛疼得无法忍受才停下来。他几乎看不清自己匆匆记下的笔记，那些关于咒语、法术和防御所需的物品。他合上书本，仔细封存并锁好，然后匆忙离开城市。

It was almost a relief to step out of the shop, where the power of the book still throbbed in the air and he turned his face into the cool breeze, sighing with relief.  
走出店铺，他几乎松了一口气。书籍的力量仍然在空气中回荡，他将脸转向凉爽的微风，舒了一口气。

First things first: supplies.  
首先要做的事情：准备物资。

Thankfully, he didn’t have to go far, the Saturday market open, just off Rupert Street. Stacks of tasty artisanal goodies awaited him, but he forced himself to focus, though the people who bundled up herbs and plants for him stared at him in worried dismay.  
幸运的是，他不必走得太远，周六市场就在鲁珀特街附近开放。一堆堆美味的手工艺品等着他，但他强迫自己集中注意力，尽管为他捆绑草药和植物的人们满怀担忧地盯着他。

“You okay, mate?” A young man asked warily as he handed over a parcel.  
“你还好吗，伙计？”一个年轻人戒备地问道，递过一个包裹。

“Why wouldn’t I be?” Aziraphale asked irritably, snatching his bundle and weaving on between the stalls and stands. He was poking through another stand when the radio playing beside the stallholder crackled.  
“为什么不呢？”阿齐拉费尔恼怒地问道，抓起他的捆包，在摊位和货摊之间穿行。当他在另一个摊位上翻找时，摊主旁边播放的收音机发出了噼啪声。

“What the Heaven is going on, Aziraphale? What have you done?”  
“天啊，亚齐拉费尔，到底发生了什么？你做了什么？”

Aziraphale swung around to stare at it. “Who’s that?”  
亚齐拉费尔转过身来盯着它。“那是谁？”

“The boy, Warlock!” The voice – a charming lady presenter from the sounds of it – snarled. “We took him to the Fields of Megiddo! The dog is not with him! The child knows nothing of the great war! He is _not_ our Master’s son!”  
“那个男孩，术士！”声音——听起来是一个迷人的女主持人——咆哮道。“我们把他带到了米吉多的战场！狗不在他身边！这个孩子对伟大的战争一无所知！他不是我们主人的儿子！”

“Ohhh.” Aziraphale looked down at the bundles in his arms. Too late. Too late by far.  
“哦。”亚齐拉费尔低头看着怀中的捆绑物。太晚了。远远晚了。

“You’re dead meat, Aziraphale,” the voice growled. “You’re bloody history! You stay where you are! We’re coming to collect you!”  
“你完蛋了，阿齐拉费尔！”那个声音咆哮道。“你注定要成为历史！你就呆在原地吧！我们要来收拾你！”

Stay where you are? Not bloody likely.  
你就呆在那里？不可能的。

Aziraphale turned on his heel, striding back through the crowds, heart thundering.  
亚齐拉费尔转身，大步穿过人群，心脏怦然跳动。

That changed everything. They were coming for him, which meant there was no time to get to the Antichrist and stop him. The only option was to run as far and as fast as possible. Leave the earth behind.  
那改变了一切。他们正在追捕他，这意味着没有时间去找到那个救世主并阻止他。唯一的选择就是尽可能地远离并快速逃跑。抛下这个地球。

His footsteps faltered and he stopped short.  
他的脚步踉跄了一下，然后他突然停了下来。

Leave the earth behind. Leave _Crowley_ behind. Leave him to perish with the rest of them.  
抛开地球。抛开克劳利。让他与其他人一同灭亡。

Aziraphale broke into a run, only stopping briefly at his shop and trying desperately to call the angel. When there was no reply, he abandoned all thought of calm and ran as fast as he could, crashing through the crowds of the city to flag down the first taxi he could find.  
亚齐拉费尔开始全速奔跑，只在自己的店铺稍作停留，拼命试图联系那位天使。当没有回应时，他放弃了冷静的想法，尽全力奔跑，穿过城市的人群，寻找第一辆出租车。

To his relief, when he reached St. Dunstan’s hill, the angel was sitting on the bench in the garden outside the church, looking white as a sheet.  
令他感到宽慰的是，当他到达圣邓斯坦山时，天使正坐在教堂外的花园长椅上，脸色苍白如纸。

“Crowley!” he called out, as he scrambled out of the cab. “My dear!”  
“克劳利！”他从出租车里爬了出来，大声喊道。“亲爱的！”

Crowley jumped, scrambling to his feet and backing away, as if expecting to be struck, then stared in incomprehension. “Aziraphale… your face…”  
克劳利跳了起来，手忙脚乱地站了起来，退后几步，仿佛期待着被打击，然后茫然地盯着阿齐拉费尔。“阿齐拉费尔...你的脸...”

Puzzled, the demon touched his cheek. The skin was flaking, and his fingertips came away damp with blood by his eyes. “Oh.” Well, that certainly explained some of the reactions around the market. “Nothing important.” He hurried towards him, hands raised to show he was unarmed and harmless. “Look, I’m sorry about yesterday. We were both a little worked up, weren’t we? Yes. Yes, I think we were.” He came closer still, gently catching the angel’s arms as if he was a skittish animal that might bolt. “We need to go.”  
困惑之下，恶魔触摸了自己的脸颊。皮肤正在脱落，他的指尖沾满了眼睛附近的血迹。“哦。”嗯，这解释了市场上的一些反应。“没什么重要的。”他急忙朝他走去，双手举起以示自己没有武器，也没有危害。“听着，我对昨天的事感到抱歉。我们都有点激动，不是吗？是的，是的，我想我们都是。”他走得更近了，轻轻抓住天使的手臂，就像是抓住了一个可能会逃跑的胆怯动物。“我们需要走了。”

“What?” Crowley flinched back. “No!”  
“什么？”克劳利退缩了。“不！”

“Hell has worked out everything,” Aziraphale said impatiently. “About Warlock, the Antichrist, everything! They know it was my fault and they’re coming.” He caught the angel’s hand. “Darling, they’re coming for me and the end is coming, but we can go. Now. There’s a whole universe out there! Dozens of places! Beautiful places!”  
“地狱已经安排好一切，”阿齐拉费尔不耐烦地说道。“关于沃洛克，关于大魔王，一切都知道了！他们知道是我的错，他们要来了。”他抓住天使的手。“亲爱的，他们要来找我，末日即将来临，但我们可以离开。现在就可以。整个宇宙都在那里等着我们！有数十个地方！美丽的地方！”

“Aziraphale, stop it, please.” The angel looked stricken. “Look, if I can just get in touch with the right people, if I can let them know what’s going on, I can–”  
“Aziraphale，别这样，拜托。” 天使一脸痛苦的表情。“听着，如果我能联系到合适的人，告诉他们发生了什么，我就能够……”

“Can? Can what?” Aziraphale shook his head furiously. “There are no _right_ people, Crowley! Heaven? Hell? No! There’s only God, moving in mysterious ways and She’s not listening to _any_ of us!”  
“可以？可以什么？”亚齐拉费尔愤怒地摇了摇头。“没有所谓的合适的人，克劳利！天堂？地狱？不存在！只有上帝，以神秘的方式行动，她根本不听我们的！”

Crowley’s face creased in pain. “I have to _try_. I’ll– I’ll tell Her what’s happening and She can fix it.”  
克劳利的脸上露出痛苦的皱纹。“我必须试一试。我会告诉她发生了什么，她可以解决这个问题。”

Aziraphale stared at him in disbelief. “Darling, that _won’t_ happen. That’ll _never_ happen. She doesn’t listen to _any_ of us. She doesn’t _care_.”  
亚齐拉费尔怀疑地盯着他。“亲爱的，那不会发生的。永远不会发生。她不听我们任何人的话。她不在乎。”

The angel almost looked like he was about to cry. “But _I_ do,” he said so gently as if Aziraphale was the one terrified and falling apart. He reached out and squeezed Aziraphale’s hand and it felt like the whisper of a blessing. “And I forgive you.”  
那位天使几乎看起来快要哭了。“但是我知道，”他温柔地说道，仿佛亚齐拉费尔才是那个恐惧和崩溃的人。他伸出手，握住亚齐拉费尔的手，感觉就像是一声祝福的低语。“而且我原谅你。”

Forgive him? For what? For running? For leaving him behind? For not dragging him kicking and screaming into infinity?  
原谅他？为什么？因为他逃跑了？因为他把他抛在身后了？因为他没有把他拖着踢踢踢地拖进无尽的未来？

Aziraphale backed away, anger, grief and despair all vying with one another. “I won’t stay,” he said, his voice escaping through ground teeth. “I won’t die for a world, for a God, who doesn’t even give a damn. If you’re stupid enough to think we have any chance to do anything, then on your head be it.”  
亚齐拉费尔退后了，愤怒、悲伤和绝望相互争斗着。“我不会留下来。”他咬牙切齿地说道，“我不会为一个连一点兴趣都没有的世界、一个连一点兴趣都没有的上帝而去死。如果你愚蠢到认为我们有任何机会做些什么，那就由你自己承担吧。”

He tried not to look back as he scrambled back into the cab, but how could he not?  
他努力不回头，匆忙爬回出租车里，但他怎么能不回头呢？

The angel was standing forlornly by the door of his – their – church, eyes wide and dark.  
天使孤单地站在他们的教堂门口，眼睛宽大而深邃。

Aziraphale forced himself to turn away. “Back to Soho,” he snapped.  
亚齐拉费尔强迫自己转身离开。“回到索霍区，”他厉声说道。

He couldn’t think of stupid, melodramatic angels, not when the legions of Hell would be coming after him. He’d anticipated it for a long time, expected it sooner rather than later. He hurried into his shop, shutting and locking the door, then gathered up his many parcels from the market and went through to the backroom.  
他无法想象愚蠢而夸张的天使，尤其是当地狱的军团会追赶他的时候。他早就预料到了，希望它能早点发生。他匆忙进入自己的店铺，关上并锁上门，然后拿起市场上的许多包裹，走进后面的房间。

Preparations needed to be made.  
需要做好准备。

They were more difficult than he’d anticipated with so many items that could inflict damage on him as well as any unexpected – or entirely expected – guests. By the time he heard the rattling at the door and felt the press of familiar presences against his wards, he had arranged everything to… well, if not save him completely, at least distract them and buy him enough time to make a clean getaway.  
他们比他预料的要困难得多，有很多东西可能会对他造成伤害，还有一些意外的或完全预料到的客人。当他听到门口的响声，感受到熟悉的存在对他的结界施加压力时，他已经安排好了一切……嗯，至少可以分散他们的注意力，给他足够的时间逃脱。

Aziraphale settled into his broadest, most comfortable armchair in the one room where the books were safely locked away behind closed doors. He could hear their voices now, and the crackle of glass and he smiled grimly to himself. Hastur and Ligur, as always. So traditional, so predictable.  
亚齐拉费尔舒服地坐在他最宽敞、最舒适的扶手椅上，这个房间是唯一一个书籍被安全地锁在紧闭的门后的地方。他现在能听到他们的声音，还有玻璃碎裂的声音，他自嘲地微笑着。哈斯特和利古，一如既往。如此传统，如此可预测。

“We know you’re in there, Aziraphale,” Ligur growled as the door crashed inwards. “We only want to talk.”  
“我们知道你在里面，阿齐拉费尔，”利古尔咆哮着，门砰地一声被撞开。“我们只是想谈谈。”

Aziraphale held his unnecessary breath, counting slowly down to steady himself, as Ligur pushed through the curtain and into the backroom. “Afternoon, Ligur,” he murmured, then swung up his right hand from beside the chair, leaning forward and holding it out at arm’s length. A gun gleamed in his gloved hand.  
亚齐拉费尔屏住了不必要的呼吸，缓慢地倒数以稳定自己，当利古尔穿过帘子进入后房时。他低声说道：“下午好，利古尔。”然后他从椅子旁边抬起右手，向前倾身，将手伸直。一把枪在他戴着手套的手中闪耀着光芒。

“A gun? You really think that’ll work on me?” Ligur sneered striding forward. “You really have been up here too long, haven’t you?”  
“枪？你真的以为那对我有用？”利古尔嘲笑着迈步向前。“你在这里待得太久了，是吧？”

Aziraphale wrinkled his nose. “Just long enough,” he replied and pulled the trigger of the water pistol, the spray hitting the demon full in the face. Ligur barely had time to scream before the holy water blazed brilliantly, his body giving way to the divinity. It was as impressive as it was horrifying.  
亚齐拉费尔皱了皱鼻子。“刚刚好而已，”他回答道，然后扣动了水枪的扳机，喷雾直接打在恶魔的脸上。利古尔几乎来不及尖叫，圣水熊熊燃烧，他的身体迅速被神性所取代。这一幕既令人印象深刻又令人恐惧。

Hastur made up for the lack of screaming, dancing frantically on the far side of the doorway. “That’s– that’s holy water! I can’t believe even a demon would–w-w-would! Holy water!” He inched around the simmering mess on the floor. “But he hadn’t done nothing to you!”  
哈斯特在门口的另一边疯狂地跳舞，以此来弥补缺乏尖叫声。“那是...那是圣水！我简直无法相信，即使是恶魔也会...会！圣水！”他小心翼翼地绕过地板上冒着热气的混乱。“可他对你什么都没做啊！”

“Yet,” Aziraphale countered, heart thundering as he got to his feet. The pistol was empty, but Hastur didn’t know that. He held it out at arm’s length.  
“然而，”亚齐拉费尔反驳道，心脏怦然而动，他站了起来。手枪已经空了，但哈斯特并不知道。他将手枪伸直向前。

“Y-you don’t frighten me.”  
“你-你不吓到我。”

Aziraphale smiled tightly, wishing to Heaven it did. “You’ve seen what it can do. _Try me_.”  
亚齐拉费尔勉强笑了笑，心里真希望这是真的。"你已经见识过它的能力了。试试看吧，看我能做到什么。"

The other demon stared wildly at him. “F’you were going to use that, you would’ve done it by now.”  
另一个恶魔狂野地盯着他。“要是你打算用那个，早就动手了。”

It was true, but he wasn’t about to admit it out loud. “Maybe I just wanted to gloat. After all, you and he spent enough time talking about me.” He circled the room, his eyes flicking back and forth between the floor and the demon’s face as Hastur inched sideways around the room. “Why don’t we have a little chat?”  
这是事实，但他不打算当众承认。"也许我只是想炫耀一下。毕竟，你和他花了足够多的时间谈论我。"他在房间里转了一圈，眼睛在地板和恶魔的脸上来回扫视，而哈斯特尔则在房间里慢慢移动。"我们为什么不聊聊呢？"

“Chat? After what you’ve done?”  
“聊天？在你做了那些事之后？”

“After what _I’ve_ done?” Nearly. Nearly… one more step.  
“我做了什么之后？” 差一点。差一点……再走一步。

Both of them flinched when the telephone rang and Aziraphale’s heart was hammering. No one called him except pests and…  
当电话响起时，他们俩都畏缩了一下，阿齐拉费尔的心怦怦直跳。除了讨厌的人和...没人给他打电话。

Oh Lord. 哦，主啊。

“One moment,” he said with a pleasant smile for Hastur, then snatched up the receiver. “Yes?”  
“稍等一下，”他对哈斯特露出了愉快的微笑，然后抓起了话筒。“什么事？”

“Aziraphale!” Crowley! He sounded shaken and breathless. “I know where the Antichri–”  
“亚齐拉费尔！”克劳利！他的声音听起来有些慌乱和喘不过气来。“我知道那个反基督者在哪——”

Shit. Game on again, then.  
糟糕，游戏又开始了。

No time to waste. 没时间浪费。

“Bad time, darling,” he cut across the angel. “Entertaining.” He slammed the receiver down. “Where were we?”  
“亲爱的，不巧的时机。”他打断了天使的话。“有趣。”他砰地挂断了电话。“我们刚才说到哪儿了？”

“You were bluffing,” Hastur growled and snapped his fingers.  
“你在虚张声势，”哈斯图尔咆哮着，咔嗒一声响指。

Aziraphale winced as the plastic gun exploded into shards in his glove-covered right hand, pieces raining down on the floor. “Well, yes,” he said, spreading his hands. “Only with the gun, though…”  
亚齐拉费尔用手套包裹的右手捧着那把塑料枪，它突然爆裂成碎片，雨点般洒落在地板上，他不禁皱了皱眉头。“嗯，是的，”他说着，伸开双手，“只是枪爆了而已……”

Hastur froze. “What do you mean only–”  
哈斯特停住了。"你是说只有-"

Aziraphale smiled like a snake and snapped his left fingers up. The wreath of rosemary suspended from the ceiling snapped free of its bindings, dropping, encircling the demon like a hoop on a bottle at the funfair. “That,” he purred. “Always have a back-up, my dear. It’s only sensible.”  
阿齐拉费尔笑得像一条蛇，然后用左手的手指弹了一下。悬挂在天花板上的迷迭香花环脱离了束缚，掉了下来，像游乐场上的瓶子上的环一样围绕着恶魔。“这就是备胎，亲爱的。明智之举。”

Hastur threw himself forward, rebounding off the invisible barrier. “What?!!? What the Heaven is this?”  
哈斯特向前扑去，撞在了无形的屏障上。“什么？！！？这是什么鬼东西？”

“A little trick I learned from Raziel,” Aziraphale said, sweeping his coat up off the back of the chair. “If you don’t mind, I have business to attend to.” He tapped a finger jauntily to his temple. “Enjoy your stay.”  
“这是我从拉齐尔那里学到的小窍门，”亚齐拉费尔说着，将他的外套从椅子背上披上。“如果你不介意的话，我有事要处理。”他轻快地在太阳穴上轻轻敲了一下。“祝你在这里过得愉快。”

“Don’t you dare leave me here, Aziraphale!” Hastur howled, as Aziraphale ran for the door. “AZIRAPHALE!”  
“你敢把我一个人留在这里，阿齐拉费尔！”哈斯图尔咆哮着，当阿齐拉费尔朝门口跑去。“阿齐拉费尔！”

### Chapter Text 章节正文

The drive back from Hyde Park took longer than planned, after a traffic collision and some roadworks forced Crowley into a labyrinth of backstreets towards St. Dunstan’s Hill.  
从海德公园返回的车程比计划中的要长，因为一起交通事故和一些道路施工迫使克劳利穿过一条通向圣邓斯坦山的迷宫般的小巷。

He didn’t really notice, if he was quite honest, lost in worried thought.  
他实际上并没有注意到，如果说实话，他陷入了忧虑的思考中。

The trouble was… 问题是..

The trouble was he needed to do something and the only thing he could do was go against Heaven’s orders. Directly against them, rather than strategically misinterpreting them for the greater good. He was expected to join them. He was expected to fight. If he did neither of those things, he would be publicly and openly disobeying.  
问题是他需要做些什么，而他唯一能做的就是违背天命。直接违背，而不是为了更大的利益而策略性地曲解。他被期望加入他们。他被期望战斗。如果他两者都不做，他将公开违抗。

He was an _angel_. Angels were meant to act for the greater good! They’d been commanded by God in the beginning to love and cherish humanity, but if he obeyed the command to take up arms in the war, wasn’t that going against the order he had been given before he even set foot on the earth? Did one order override another? How could you know which was the one that _had_ to be obeyed and which was the one that should be ignored?  
他曾是一个天使。天使们注定要为了更大的善行而行动！他们在最初被上帝命令去爱护和珍视人类，但如果他遵从命令参加战争，那岂不是违背了他在踏上地球之前就已经得到的命令吗？一个命令是否能够取代另一个命令？你怎么知道哪一个是必须遵守的，哪一个是可以忽略的？

It was an impossible situation. God or Heaven. They were meant to be on the same side, both of them, but now, the orders of the divine felt like they were contradicting the orders of Heaven and he was only an angel. How was he meant to know which was the right choice and which was the wrong one? How did you ask those questions without Falling?  
这是一个不可能的情况。上帝或天堂。他们本应该站在同一边，但现在，神的命令似乎与天堂的命令相矛盾，而他只是一个天使。他怎么知道哪个选择是正确的，哪个是错误的？怎么能问出这些问题而不堕落？

He pulled into the parking space beside his church and folded his arms on the steering wheel, burying his face in them for a moment. Was it so wrong to want to keep on going as he had for centuries? To help humans where he could? To nurture them and watch them grow and change and adapt? Surely that couldn’t be wrong?  
他把车停在教堂旁边的停车位上，双臂交叉放在方向盘上，一时埋头在臂弯中。他想继续像几个世纪以来那样前行，难道这样做有错吗？他想帮助人类，尽自己所能。他想培育他们，见证他们的成长、变化和适应。这难道是错的吗？

It felt, he thought achingly, like a bad time to be sober.  
他痛苦地想，现在是个不适合戒酒的时候。

He was halfway out the car when he realised he wasn’t alone in the yard, his heart plummeting like a rock.  
他刚从车里走出一半时，意识到院子里不只有他一个人，他的心像一块石头一样直往下沉。

Michael, Uriel and Sandalphon prowled towards him, their feet barely making a sound on the gravel.  
迈克尔、乌里尔和桑达尔芬悄悄地朝他靠近，他们的脚在碎石上几乎没有发出任何声音。

Crowley backed into the side of the Bentley. “Uh… guys. Hi. Didn’t know you’d be dropping in.”  
克劳利靠在宾利车的一侧。“嗯...伙计们，嗨。没想到你们会突然出现。”

“We’ve just been learning some rather disturbing things about you,” Michael murmured, dark eyes gleaming. “You’ve been a bit of a… Fallen angel, haven’t you? Consorting with the enemy?”  
"我们刚刚得知了一些相当令人不安的事情，"迈克尔低声说道，黑眼睛闪烁着光芒。"你有点像个...堕落的天使，不是吗？与敌人勾结？"

Crowley reared back away from them. Oh no. No, no, no, no, no… “I– it– n-not consorting…”  
克劳利向后退了一步，远离他们。哦不。不，不，不，不，不……“我——我——不是在勾结……”

Uriel’s lip curled in disdain. “Don’t think your boyfriend is going to get you special treatment in Hell. _He’s_ in trouble too.”  
乌里尔的嘴角带着不屑的弧度。“别以为你男朋友会在地狱里给你特殊待遇。他也有麻烦。”

Crowley’s hands scrabbled against the side of the car. Aziraphale. They knew. They knew it all. And Aziraphale was in trouble. Oh God, they were screwed. They were both screwed and there was nothing left they could do.  
克劳利的手在车边挣扎着。亚齐拉费尔。他们知道了。他们全都知道了。而且亚齐拉费尔陷入了麻烦。天啊，他们完蛋了。他们俩都完蛋了，再也无能为力了。

“Raziel,” Michael said, voice cool and hard. “It’s time to choose sides.”  
“Raziel，” Michael说道，声音冷酷而坚定。“是时候选择立场了。”

“But–” The words hitched in his throat and he took a shaky breath, forcing them out. “But do we _have_ to? I mean yeah, technically, two sides is fine. Good and evil and morality and choices and free will and all that stuff, but that… isn’t that for the humans? I mean, isn’t it our job to just keep things going? To give them a way to make the choices?”  
“但是——”他喉咙里的话卡住了，他颤抖地吸了一口气，强迫自己说出来。“但是我们必须这样吗？我的意思是，是的，从技术上讲，两个对立面没问题。善恶、道德、选择、自由意志，还有那些东西，但是…那不是人类的事吗？我的意思是，我们的工作不就是让事情继续下去吗？给他们一个选择的方式？”

Uriel snorted. “You think too much.”  
乌里尔哼了一声。“你想太多了。”

He opened his mouth to protest, but Sandalphon moved like lightning, slamming his fist up under Crowley’s ribs and doubling him over. Uriel caught him by his lapels as he folded and threw him back against the Bentley, their fists grinding against his ribs.  
他张开嘴想要抗议，但桑达尔芬迅猛地动了起来，猛击克劳利的肋骨，让他弯腰痛苦地折叠起来。乌列尔一把抓住他的衣领，将他摔回到宾利车上，他们的拳头磨擦着他的肋骨。

He stared at them, panicked. They’d never– before, he’d– they’d– it wasn’t–  
他惊慌地盯着他们。他们从未这样做过，以前他们从未这样，这不可能。

“Don’t! You can’t–” His hands shivered between them. “We– aren’t we the good guys?” Uriel’s lips curled in a smirk of disdain and that, more than anything, reached past the terror and into the outrage. “This isn’t _right_! I– She needs to know about this!” He tried to push off from the car, but Uriel’s grip was like iron. “She _needs_ to know!”  
“别！你不能——”他的双手在他们之间颤抖着。“我们——难道我们不是好人吗？”乌利尔的嘴角勾起一丝轻蔑的笑容，这比任何事情都更加激起了他的愤怒。“这不对！我——她需要知道这件事！”他试图从车上挣脱出来，但乌利尔的握力如铁。“她需要知道！”

Uriel raised her eyebrows mockingly. “You really think upstairs will take your call? After all the stunts you’ve pulled? You’re ridiculous.”  
乌里尔嘲讽地挑起了眉毛。“你真的认为楼上会接你的电话吗？考虑到你搞过的那些把戏？你真是可笑。”

They stepped back as a sound of trumpets blared from above and Crowley staggered, catching himself against the car door.  
他们退后了一步，只见从上方传来一阵喇叭声，克劳利摇摇晃晃地靠在车门上。

“This is great,” Uriel said, smiling. “It’s starting.”  
"太棒了，" Uriel笑着说道。"开始了。"

With a flare of light, they leapt Heavenwards, vanishing, leaving him slumped against the Bentley.  
他们带着一道光芒飞向天空，消失不见，只留下他瘫坐在宾利车旁。

“You…” He was shaking so hard he could barely stand up straight. “You–” A profanity danced on his tongue, but he bit down on it. “Bad angels.”  
“你……”他颤抖得几乎站不稳。“你——”一句脏话在他嘴边打转，但他咬住了。“坏天使。”

It took all his effort to stagger over to the bench at the edge of the garden, collapsing there, his legs shaking. Too much. All too much. They knew. They knew about him and Aziraphale. They knew about his doubts. They knew everything and it wasn’t enough to stop them or change their minds and if he didn’t join them, if he didn’t side with them…  
他费尽全力蹒跚着走到花园边的长凳旁，一头栽倒在那里，双腿颤抖着。太多了。太多了。他们知道。他们知道他和阿齐拉费尔之间的事。他们知道他的疑虑。他们知道一切，但这并不足以阻止他们或改变他们的想法，如果他不加入他们，如果他不站在他们这一边…

And then, of course, then, as if summoned by Crowley’s distress, Aziraphale materialised, bursting out of a cab, eyes red and bloody, face blistered, urging Crowley to run, again, to leave, to flee, to be safe somewhere else that wasn’t here with him. They could both be safe. They could escape. They could _live_.  
然后，当然，然后，仿佛被克劳利的困扰所召唤，阿齐拉费尔出现了，从一辆出租车里冲了出来，眼睛红肿，脸上起了水泡，催促克劳利再次逃跑，离开这里，逃离，去一个与他不在一起的安全地方。他们都可以安全。他们可以逃脱。他们可以活下去。

Oh it was tempting. Lord, it was tempting, but that was what he did, wasn’t it?  
哦，这真是诱人。主啊，这真是诱人，但这就是他所做的，不是吗？

But the earth… 但是地球..

Crowley felt like he was standing on the lip of a precipice with Heaven at his back and a bottomless Fall in front of him, but if he could just… reach out, make the call he had to make, speak to the one person he knew could fix everything…  
克劳利感觉自己站在悬崖边缘，背后是天堂，面前是无底深渊，但只要他能够伸出手，打出他必须打的电话，与那个他知道能够解决一切的人交谈…

A leap of faith, praying his wings would still hold him.  
一个信仰的飞跃，祈祷他的翅膀仍能支撑他。

He tried to explain, tried to say as much, but Aziraphale – unsurprisingly – didn’t believe a word of it. He hadn’t believed in anything for so long. “Darling, that _won’t_ happen. That’ll _never_ happen. She doesn’t listen to _any_ of us. She doesn’t _care_.”  
他试图解释，试图说得更多，但是阿齐拉费尔——毫不意外地——一句都不相信。他已经很久不相信任何事情了。“亲爱的，那不会发生的。那永远不会发生。她不听我们任何人的话。她不在乎。”

And that… 而那个..

That was the trouble. 那就是问题所在。

Crowley had been sent to earth to care for humanity and he had. And he did. And he couldn’t stop just because he was told to. “But _I_ do.” He could see the panic and distress all over the demon’s face and knew he would leave, had to leave for his own safety, but when he did, he would blame himself for leaving Crowley behind. Crowley reached out and gently squeezed his best – his only – friend’s hand. “And I forgive you.”  
克劳利被派到地球上照顾人类，他也确实做到了。他不会因为被告知而停下来。“但我会的。”他能看到恶魔脸上的恐慌和痛苦，知道他将离开，必须为了自己的安全而离开，但当他离开时，他会责怪自己抛下了克劳利。克劳利伸出手，轻轻握住他最好的、唯一的朋友的手。“我原谅你。”

The demon recoiled, eyes blazing, bloody tears on his face. “I won’t stay.” His voice was raw and despairing. “I won’t die for a world, for a God, who doesn’t even give a damn. If you’re stupid enough to think we have any chance to do anything, then on your head be it.”  
恶魔退缩了，眼睛闪烁着，脸上有血泪。“我不会留下来。”他的声音充满了绝望。“我不会为一个连一点兴趣都没有的世界、一个连一点兴趣都没有的上帝而死。如果你愚蠢到认为我们有任何机会做些什么，那就由你自己承担吧。”

He hurled himself away, but he still looked back as the cab drove off and Crowley swallowed the lump in his throat.  
他猛地扔开了自己，但在出租车驶离时，他还是回头看了一眼，克劳利咽下了喉咙里的一块东西。

Time to choose sides, he thought, turning and looking back at the Church.  
他想着，是时候选择立场了，他转过身，回望着教堂。

“You’re forcing my hand here,” he shouted to the Heavens. “I wouldn’t do this if you’d just talk to me!”  
"你逼我没办法了！"他向天空大喊道。"如果你肯跟我说话，我才不会这么做！"

When no reply came, he took a deep breath to steady himself, then marched into the church hall. The place was chaos, half-finished decorations in place for the concert that night, banners trailing down the walls and props stacked in every nook. He grabbed the broom, sweeping mounds of paper clear from the middle of the floor, then snatched one of the pots of paint and started making marks that he hadn’t needed to use in millennia.  
当没有回应时，他深吸一口气稳住自己，然后走进教堂大厅。这个地方一片混乱，为了今晚的音乐会而搭建的装饰只完成了一半，横幅从墙上垂下，道具堆满了每个角落。他拿起扫帚，将地板中间的一堆纸清理干净，然后抓起一罐油漆，开始做起了他几千年来都不需要使用的标记。

His hands were unsteady, but he knew the words, knew the marks and the terror was giving way to anger. How _dare_ they come to his home and threaten him. How _dare_ they think they had any right to say what he could and couldn’t do. How _dare_ they believe God was so cold and hard and distant as they thought.  
他的双手颤抖不已，但他知道这些词语，知道这些标记，恐惧正在被愤怒所取代。他们竟然敢来到他的家中威胁他。他们竟然认为自己有权利决定他能做什么、不能做什么。他们竟然相信上帝是那么冷酷、那么坚硬、那么遥远。

He gathered the candles, placing them on the floor, then lit them all at once with a snap of his fingers, then paused, breathing hard. He’d tried pleading. He’d tried asking. He’d tried begging. Now… now, was the time to demand action.  
他收集了蜡烛，把它们放在地板上，然后用手指一弹，一下子点燃了所有的蜡烛，然后停下来，喘着粗气。他曾试过恳求，试过请求，试过乞求。现在...现在是时候要求行动了。

“You listening to me?” He pressed his hands together in front of him. “Don’t pretend like you don’t hear me! I know you do! You going to answer me for once?”  
“你在听我说吗？”他双手合十放在面前。“别假装你没听见！我知道你听得到！你打算回答我一次吗？”

To his shock and relief, the circle blazed with light, a radiant glowing column splashing off the ceiling high above.  
令他震惊和宽慰的是，圆圈闪耀着光芒，一道辉煌的光柱溅射到高高的天花板上。

“Hello? You there?” 喂？你在吗？

“Speak, Raziel,” a booming voice echoed off the rafters, a shimmering, shapeless face manifesting in the light.  
“说吧，拉齐尔。”一个声音在梁柱间回荡，一个闪烁着、无形的面孔在光线中显现出来。

Crowley’s heart thundered. “God? That you?” The face took a more familiar shape and his heart sank. “Oh. It’s you.”  
克劳利的心怦然而动。“上帝？是你吗？”那张脸变得更加熟悉，他的心沉了下去。“哦，是你。”

“Yes,” the Metatron replied. “You know to speak to me is to speak to God. I am the voice of the Almighty.”  
“是的，”梅塔特隆回答道。“你知道与我交谈就是在与上帝交谈。我是全能者的声音。”

Crowley pinched the bridge of his nose. “Well, no. You’re not really. Maybe to the humans, yeah, but come on. This is me.” He looked back up at the Metatron. “I don’t want to be fobbed off with a spokesman. I need to speak to Her.”  
克劳利捏了捏鼻梁。“嗯，不，你并不是真的。或许对于人类来说是这样，但拜托，这是我。”他抬头看着梅塔特隆。“我不想被一个发言人搪塞过去。我需要与她直接交谈。”

“What is said to me is said to the Almighty.”  
对我所说的话，就是对全能者说的话。

Yes, he wanted to protest, but that meant nuance, context and even content could be radically reinterpreted. He’d been there, after all. He’d lived through millennia of Chinese whispers as the foundation of faith.  
是的，他想要抗议，但这意味着细微差别、背景和甚至内容都可能被彻底重新解释。毕竟，他曾经在那里。他经历了千百年来作为信仰基础的传言。

“Well, Raziel?” The Metatron prompted.  
“那么，Raziel呢？”大天使Metatron催促道。

“Fine…” Crowley sighed. “Fine.” He held up the Nutter book. “Can you let Her know that I found out who the Antichrist is and where we can find him?”  
“好吧……”克劳利叹了口气。“好吧。”他举起《疯狂先生》这本书。“你能告诉她，我找到了那个敌基督是谁，以及我们可以在哪里找到他吗？”

“Good work,” the Metatron said with a tone that sounded uncomfortably like Gabriel. “Well done.”  
“干得好。”梅塔特隆说着，语气听起来有些不舒服，像是加百列一样。“干得漂亮。”

“Aren’t you listening?” Crowley threw his arms wide in frustration. “We can stop the war! No bleeding seas! No death! No destruction! Are you telling me that’s not a good thing?”  
“你没在听吗？”克劳利沮丧地张开双臂说道。“我们可以停止战争！没有流血的海洋！没有死亡！没有毁灭！你是在告诉我这不是好事吗？”

The Metatron’s brow furrowed, his vast gleaming head shaking slowly as if listening to a demanding child. “The point is not to avoid the war,” he said. “The point is to _win_ it.”  
梅塔特隆皱起眉头，他巨大闪亮的头颅缓慢摇晃，仿佛在倾听一个要求苛刻的孩子。“关键不是避免战争，”他说。“关键是要赢得它。”

To win it. 赢得它。

Again. 再次。

Yet another angel, just like all the rest.  
又一个天使，和所有其他的一样。

“God…” Crowley groaned, burying his face in his hand. Aziraphale was right. Hell or Heaven, they were both the same. God wasn’t interested in intervening. There were no _right_ people.  “You guys…” Wait… wait, wait, wait. No _right_ people, but maybe enough wrong ones with enough information to do _something_. He rubbed slowly at his eyes, then forced his head up. “So what’s the plan, then?” He sounded quite calm, all things considered. Definitely not screaming. “How do we start it all?”  
“天啊…” 克劳利抱怨着，用手捂住脸。阿齐拉费尔是对的。无论是地狱还是天堂，它们都一样。上帝对干预不感兴趣。没有所谓的正确之人。“你们…” 等一下…等等，等等。没有正确之人，但也许有足够多的错误之人拥有足够的信息来做些什么。他缓慢地揉了揉眼睛，然后强迫自己抬起头。“那么，计划是什么？” 考虑到一切，他听起来相当冷静。绝对不是在尖叫。“我们该如何开始？”

The Metatron smiled benevolently. “We thought a multi-nation nuclear exchange would be a nice start.”  
梅塔特隆仁慈地微笑着说道：“我们觉得多国之间的核打击会是一个不错的开始。”

Of course. _Of course_. Use the clever little innovations of the humans to end everything that they had made. Good thing about humans was their bad habit of putting a failsafe in. They just needed to find the big red button to stop everything. “Mm. Good plan. Messy.”  
当然。当然。利用人类聪明的小创新来结束他们所创造的一切。人类的好处就是他们有一个坏习惯，总是在其中设置一个安全措施。他们只需要找到那个停止一切的大红按钮。“嗯，好计划。有点凌乱。”

“The battle commences, Raziel,” the Metatron said firmly. “Join us.”  
“战斗开始了，Raziel，”大天使长坚定地说道。“加入我们。”

Like Hell, he would. Still, as long as they didn’t realise, not until it was too late.  
他才不会呢。只要他们没有意识到，直到为时已晚。

He forced a smile. “Give us a few minutes. Things to… tidy up down here. You know how it is.”  
他勉强笑了笑。“给我们几分钟。这里还有些事情要整理一下。你知道的。”

The Metatron nodded. “We will leave the gateway open for you, then,” he said. “Do not dawdle.”  
梅塔特隆点了点头。“那么，我们会为你保持门户开放，”他说道。“不要拖延时间。”

The looming face above him vanished and the gleaming column of light shrank to a pulsing glow inside the circle painted on the floor. Crowley set the Nutter book down on one of the tables and groped in his pocket for his phone.  
他头顶上那张阴森的脸消失了，闪亮的光柱也缩小成了地板上画着的圆圈内的脉动光芒。克劳利把《纳特》书放在桌子上，伸手从口袋里摸出手机。

Aziraphale’s number was – as always – first on the list and he dialled, pacing up towards the stage at the far end of the church impatiently.  
亚齐拉费尔的电话号码始终是名单上的第一个，他不耐烦地走向教堂尽头的舞台，边走边拨号。

“C’mon, c’mon, c’mon…” He heard the click of the phone being picked up on the other end. “Aziraphale! I know where the Antichri–”  
"快点，快点，快点..." 他听到电话那头传来的嘟嘟声。"阿齐拉费尔！我知道那个反基督者在哪里-"

“Bad time, darling,” Aziraphale interrupted more rudely than he ever had in the past. “Entertaining.”  
“亲爱的，不是个好时机。”阿齐拉费尔打断得比以往更粗鲁。“有客人。”

The phone cut off and Crowley stared at it. Even when Aziraphale amused himself with humans, there had never been an occasion when he hadn’t dropped them like hot coals for Crowley. He was about to dial again when a clatter made him turn around.  
手机断了，克劳利盯着它看。即使阿齐拉费尔对人类感到有趣，他从来没有不抛弃他们而选择克劳利。他正要再次拨号时，一阵嘈杂声让他转过身来。

A shabby, whey-faced man was standing in the middle of the hall, face so off-colour it took the angel a moment to recognise him.  
一个衣衫褴褛、面色苍白的男人站在大厅中央，脸色如此难看，让天使花了一会儿才认出他来。

“_Shadwell_?” He glanced beyond the man and at the doors he’d forgotten to lock. “What the Hell are you doing here?” he demanded.  
“沙德威尔？”他瞥了一眼那个人，然后看向他忘记锁上的门。“你他妈的在这里干什么？”他要求道。

“You…” Shadwell snarled. “You conniving tool of the de’il!”  
“你……”沙德威尔咆哮道。“你这个狡诈的魔鬼工具！”

“You what?” 你说什么？

“You! You monster! Luring folk in with your music and your fiendish wiles! Desecrating a house of the Lord!”  
你！你这个怪物！用你的音乐和邪恶的诡计引诱人们！亵渎上帝的殿堂！

Shadwell advanced towards him and Crowley yelped in alarm, darting around the glowing circle on the floor, flinging himself between it and the man, spreading his arms wide. “Look, you’ve got the wrong end of the stick!” he exclaimed. “Seriously! I’m not– well, technically, yeah, I _am_ in league with a demon, but not the devil! Exactly the opposite actually!”  
沙德韦尔朝他走来，克劳利惊恐地尖叫着，在地板上闪烁的圆圈周围飞奔，将自己扔在圈子和那个人之间，双臂张开。他大声说道：“听着，你完全误会了！”他解释道：“真的！我不是——嗯，从技术上讲，我确实与恶魔勾结，但不是与魔鬼！事实上完全相反！”

“Oh, I’ll not be fooled again!” Shadwell groped in his pockets. “I’ll exorcise you with bell, book and candle!”  
"哦，我再也不会被愚弄了！" 谢德威尔在口袋里摸索着。"我会用钟、书和蜡烛来驱魔你！"

“Right, good luck with that!” Crowley tried to herd the man back, but Shadwell only retreated as far as the nearest table, grabbing a tambourine and the Nutter book, before swinging them in Crowley’s direction. “Oh, for Heaven’s sake!”  
“好的，祝你好运！”克劳利试图把那个人赶回去，但沙德维尔只是退到最近的桌子旁边，抓起一个铃鼓和纳特的书，然后朝克劳利挥舞过去。“哦，天哪！”

“Bell!” Shadwell roar, throwing the tambourine at him.  
“铃声！”沙德维尔咆哮着，将铃鼓扔向他。

“Stop!” Crowley yelped, ducking under it and retreating a step. “Oh, you idiot! The circle’s dangerous! You’ll get ripped to pieces if you… Jesus!” He ducked back to avoid the hurled book, the pages whiffling as it flew by his ear. “You bloody maniac!”  
“停下！”克劳利尖叫着，躲开并后退了一步。“哦，你这个白痴！这个圈子很危险！如果你...天啊！”他又躲开了被扔出来的书，书页在他耳边飞过时发出呼呼声。“你这个疯子！”

The Witchfinder shoved his lighter in Crowley’s face, making him totter back another couple of steps. “Candle!” He howled. “By the powers invested in me as a duly appointed Witchfinder–”  
巫师猛地把打火机对准克劳利的脸，使他再往后退了几步。“蜡烛！”他嚎叫道。“根据我作为一名合法任命的巫师猎人所授予的权力——”

“For God’s sake will you listen! Get away from the circle, you stupid idio–”  
求求你了，你能不能听一下！离开那个圈子，你这个蠢货——

Shadwell bared his teeth, batting aside Crowley’s arm. “I charge ye to quit this place and return henceforth to the place from which ye came, and delivery us from evil returning nae more!” He stabbed his finger towards Crowley’s face, making him trip back over his own feet.  
沙德韦尔露出了牙齿，挥动手臂将克劳利推开。“我命令你离开这个地方，回到你来的地方，永远不要再回来侵扰我们！”他伸出手指指向克劳利的脸，让他绊倒在自己的脚上。

Too late, he felt the hum of power and stared down in horror.  
太晚了，他感受到了力量的嗡鸣声，惊恐地凝视着下方。

“Oh…” He met Shadwell’s eyes with dismay. “_Shit_.”  
"哦..."他惊恐地与沙德维尔对视着。“该死。”

Heavenly power shot through his body, surging upwards and the earthly world vanished around him.  
天威贯穿他的身体，向上涌动，尘世间在他周围消失了。

Several seconds later, any passerby would have seen a shabby, ashen man staggering out of the open doorway of the old church, cradling his right hand against his chest. They might also have heard the doors creaking in the wind. And if they had paid more than a London’s blink of attention beyond those open doors, they might have noticed the flames before it was too late.  
几秒钟后，任何路人都会看到一个破旧、灰白的男人摇摇晃晃地从古老教堂的敞开门口走出来，右手抱在胸前。他们可能还听到了风中门吱吱作响的声音。如果他们在那扇敞开的门后多花一点时间留意，也许在为时已晚之前他们会注意到火焰的存在。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Aziraphale drummed his fingers impatiently on the back of the driver’s seat.  
亚齐拉费尔不耐烦地在司机座椅的背上敲着手指。

“Who’re you again?” The human in the seat demanded.  
“你又是谁？”坐在座位上的人要求道。

“St. Dunstan’s Hill,” Aziraphale snapped. “Now.”  
“圣邓斯坦山”，阿齐拉费尔厉声说道。“现在。”

It was harder and harder to hold the control. No cabs meant he’d had to grab the first car he saw and he was too distracted, too worried to keep the human in check. He dialled and redialled the mobile telephone he’d borrowed off another human, but Crowley wasn’t answering and that never happened, not in all the time since the invention of the telephone. Worse yet, he couldn’t sense where the angel was to get to him and that…  
控制变得越来越困难。没有出租车意味着他不得不抓住他看到的第一辆车，他太心烦意乱，太担心无法控制那个人类。他拨打了又拨打借来的手机，但克劳利没有回应，这从来没有发生过，自从电话发明以来都没有发生过。更糟糕的是，他无法感知到天使的位置以便去找他，这...

That scared the Hell out of him.  
那把他吓得要命。

“Yes, but–” 是的，但是--

“Oh for Satan’s sake!” He reached into the human’s mind, took control of his body, slamming down a foot on the accelerator. It only worked to ram them into another car in front and he snarled in fury, scrambling out the back of the car.  
“哦，见鬼！”他伸手进入人类的思维，控制住他的身体，猛踩油门。然而，这只导致他们撞上前方的另一辆车，他愤怒地咆哮着，从车后面爬了出来。

Of all the damned times for the taxis to be in short supply, it had to be now.  
偏偏出租车供应不足的时候，偏偏是现在。

It was a sign of true desperation that he ran down into the Underground, vaulting the barriers and tearing his way down to the platform. Still the phone rang and rang in his hand and around him, people grew more and more agitated, snapping at each other, pushing angrily, turning on one another.  
他冲进地铁站，跃过闸机，冲下台阶，这是真正绝望的迹象。手机在他手中不停地响个不停，周围的人越来越焦躁不安，彼此争吵，愤怒地推搡，甚至开始相互攻击。

Aziraphale didn’t notice. He didn’t care, wrapping himself against the handrail and staring at the map as station by station they inched closer and closer.  
亚齐拉费尔没有注意到。他并不在意，紧紧抓住扶手，盯着地图，一站一站地靠近。

“Where are you, you idiot?” he growled under his breath. “Answer your damned phone.”  
“你在哪里，你这个白痴？”他咬牙切齿地低声咆哮道。“接你该死的电话。”

Even before he emerged from the station, he could hear the sirens and smell the smoke and for the first time in six millennia, a prayer caught on his tongue as he ran up the escalators, throwing tourists aside in his haste. He saw the smoke and knew at once where it was coming from.  
甚至在他走出车站之前，他就能听到警报声和闻到烟味，六千年来第一次，一句祈祷在他的舌尖上停留，他急忙冲上自动扶梯，推开游客。他看到了烟雾，立刻知道它来自哪里。

The church was blazing, flames licking up through the roof and bursting through the windows, and Aziraphale pushed his way through the horrified crowds, staring up at it.  
教堂起火了，火焰从屋顶冲天而起，窗户破碎，阿齐拉费尔穿过惊恐的人群，抬头望着火势。

It was like Falling all over again, his world dropping away beneath him.  
就像再次跌倒一样，他的世界在他脚下消失了。

“Crowley…” he breathed. He was moving before the thought even took shape in his mind, leaping the police cordon and running for the doors. Voices cried out in warning and alarm, but he ignored them, a snap of his fingers bursting the doors wide open.  
“克劳利……”他喘着气说道。在他的思绪形成之前，他就已经开始行动了，跃过警戒线，冲向大门。有人大声警告和惊叫，但他置之不理，一声手指响动，大门瞬间被他撞开。

The inside of the church was an inferno and for a split second, he had a blur of double-vision, of Crowley standing there, at the end of the aisle, watching as Aziraphale danced, feet burning, towards him. He’d got there in time before. He’d made it in time and now–  
教堂内部如同地狱一般，他的视线一瞬间模糊了起来，看到克劳利站在过道尽头，注视着阿齐拉费尔燃烧着的脚步向他舞动。他之前曾及时赶到过。他赶在了最后时刻，现在...

An aching groan from above made him run forward as the ceiling crashed inwards and he dived to avoid the worst of it, rolling across the floor amid ash and ruin. His hand skittered on a smouldering heap and he turned, staring. A book? Crowley rarely read, if ever.  
从上方传来一声痛苦的呻吟，他立即向前跑去，天花板倒塌，他躲开了最严重的部分，滚在灰尘和废墟之间的地板上。他的手在一个冒烟的堆积物上滑动，他转过身，目不转睛地看着。一本书？克劳利很少读书，如果有的话。

Maybe, then… maybe he hadn’t been here?  
也许，那么...也许他从来没有来过这里？

But there… inches away from the book, Crowley’s mobile telephone. Aziraphale snatched it up in shaking fingers. Crowley would sooner cut off a leg than leave that behind which meant he had to be here somewhere.  
但是在书的旁边……克劳利的手机。阿齐拉费尔用颤抖的手抓起来。克劳利宁愿割掉一条腿也不会把它丢在这里，这意味着他一定在这附近。

Aziraphale staggered to his feet, holding book and telephone, staring around.  
亚齐拉费尔摇摇晃晃地站起身来，手里拿着书和电话，四处张望着。

“Crowley!” The smoke burned into his lungs. “Crowley, God damn you!” He pushed deeper, through the smoke and flames, his heart stopping in his chest at the marks etched on the floor. The holy sigils. A powerful prayer circle from the books of Solomon. Burned around the edges. Divine power. Divine retribution. “No… no, no, no, no, no…”   
“克劳利！”烟雾灼入他的肺中。“克劳利，该死的！”他深入其中，穿过烟雾和火焰，他的心在胸腔中停止跳动，因为地板上刻着的痕迹。神圣的符号。所罗门书中的强大祈祷圈。边缘烧焦。神圣的力量。神圣的报应。“不...不，不，不，不，不...”

He fell to his knees, scrabbling at the marks, trying to find a break in them, something to say that it hadn’t been– that it wasn’t–  
他跪倒在地，拼命地抓着那些痕迹，试图找到其中的破绽，找到一些证据来证明那不是真的，那不是..

His fingers seared and he swore, recoiling.  
他的手指被灼烧得他咒骂着退缩了。

Oh. 哦。

“You…” His hands hovered, bleeding, over the circle. “You’re gone. Darling… darling, come back…”  
“你……”他的双手颤抖着，滴血的手指悬停在圆圈上。“你已经离开了。亲爱的……亲爱的，请回来……”

He didn’t hear the scream of burning rafters, barely noticed them until they crashed down around him. He lifted smoke-red eyes to the ceiling to the daylight beyond the flames.  
他没有听到燃烧的横梁发出的尖叫声，直到它们在他周围坠落时才勉强注意到。他抬起烟红的眼睛望向天花板，透过火焰看到了外面的阳光。

“You bastards,” he growled. “You’ve killed him.” He snatched up Crowley’s cracked telephone and the charcoal brick of his book, stumbling back to his feet. “You shouldn’t have done that.”  
“你们这帮混蛋！”他咆哮道。“你们害死了他。”他抓起克劳利破裂的电话和他的书的炭块，蹒跚地站了起来。“你们不应该这样做。”

There was an entrance to Heaven from earth. He knew where it was. He knew how to get there. He also knew enough back channels and tricks that if he played his cards right, he could napalm the fuck out of it. Maybe it wouldn’t destroy it all, but if it hurt them, oh so much the better. They needed to _learn_. They needed to _know_ what it was to suffer, the hypocritical murderous bastards.  
从地球到天堂有一个入口。他知道它在哪里。他知道如何到达那里。他还知道足够多的后门和诀窍，如果他打好牌，他可以彻底摧毁它。也许它不会完全被摧毁，但如果能伤害到他们，那就更好了。他们需要学习。他们需要知道什么是痛苦，这些伪善的杀人恶棍们。

He stalked out of the blazing church doors, the fire fighters rearing away from him. The crowd parted like the Red sea before him, the wave of malevolence in his wake dragging them back against one another like the sea swallowing the Egyptians. Curses and shouts and blows echoed behind him, wrath spreading out like a plague.  
他怒气冲冲地从熊熊燃烧的教堂门口走出，消防员们纷纷躲开他。人群在他面前像红海一样分开，他身后的恶意浪潮将他们拖回彼此之间，就像大海吞噬埃及人一样。咒骂声、喊叫声和拳打脚踢声在他身后回荡，愤怒像瘟疫一样蔓延开来。

If anyone from Heaven had been paying attention at that point, they would have noticed a spreading pattern of darkness blazing out from a solitary burning church. Cars slammed into one another. Opportunists smashed shop windows, grabbing whatever they wanted. People went at one another’s throats.  
如果天堂的任何人在那个时刻留意到的话，他们会注意到一种黑暗的蔓延模式从一座燃烧的孤立教堂中迸发出来。汽车相互撞击。机会主义者砸碎商店橱窗，随意拿取他们想要的东西。人们互相攻击。

And at the head of it, Aziraphale stormed through the city, fury and wrath boiling off him like sulphur.  
在其中，阿齐拉费尔愤怒地穿过城市，愤怒和怒火如硫磺般迸发。

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

No one, of course, noticed.  
当然，没有人注意到。

After all, there was a war to prepare for, and the Quartermaster was signing out uniforms and supplies when there the thunderclap of a returning angel.  
毕竟，这是一场为战争做准备的战斗，当军需官正在签发制服和物资时，突然传来了一个天使归来的雷鸣声。

He looked around impatiently and halfway up the long hall, spotted the newest arrival. “Oi! You!”  
他不耐烦地四处张望，走到长廊的一半时，他发现了最新到来的人。“嘿！你！”

The angel reeled around, clutching his ribs. “Scuse me?” He was a tall, gangly creature with red hair, not one the Quartermaster recognised. His clothing was appalling, a short-sleeved, buttonless white shirt and trousers so tight they might have been painted on. The Quartermaster was almost certain there was a cartoon of a cactus picked out on the shirt as well.  
天使转过身来，抱着他的肋骨。“对不起？”他是一个高个子、瘦长的生物，有着红色的头发，军需官不认识他。他的服装简直糟糕透顶，一件无袖的白色衬衫，没有纽扣，裤子紧得仿佛是涂上去的。军需官几乎可以确定衬衫上还有一个仙人掌的卡通图案。

“Better fall in, my lad.”  
“小伙子，最好跟上。”

The angel stared at him. “Er, no. There’s been a bit of a cock-up.” He pointed over to the shimmering globe that gently turned in the middle of the hall. “I’m meant to be down there. I’ve got stuff to do. I shouldn’t be here.”  
天使盯着他看着。“呃，不对。出了点小问题。”他指着大厅中间轻轻转动的闪烁球。“我应该在那边。我有事情要做。我不应该在这里。”

The Quartermaster looked him up and down. “You’re late enough already.” He held out the bundled uniform. “Your whole platoon is waiting for you.”  
军需官上下打量了他一眼。“你已经迟到够久了。”他递出一捆制服。“你整个排都在等你。”

“Platoon?” The angel looked down at the uniform in his arms. “No. I– that’s not right.”  
“排？”天使低头看着他怀中的制服。“不对。我——那不对。”

The Quartermaster sighed impatiently. “Raziel, aren’t you? Former archangel?”  
军需官不耐烦地叹了口气。“你就是拉齐尔吧？前大天使？”

There was something mutinous in the angel’s expression. “I don’t go by that name anymore.”  
天使的表情中有一种叛逆的气息。“我不再用那个名字了。”

“Raziel?” The Quartermaster stared at him. “Ohh. I remember you now. The one with the Book.”  
“Raziel？”军需官盯着他看。“哦，我现在记起你了。那个有书的人。”

“Oh, for God’s sake!” The angel exclaimed, throwing down the uniform. “Will you all stop going on about the fucking book!” The Quartermaster reared back in shocked indignation at the profanity and heard the susurration of gasps behind him. “Yes! I gave it to the humans! Whoop-de-doo! So what? I was there to help them so I did my job, didn’t I! And I plan to keep on doing it, so stuff your war!”  
“哦，天哪！”天使大声喊道，扔下制服。“你们能不能别再谈论那该死的书了！”军需官惊愕地后退，听到身后一阵窃窃私语。“是的！我把它给了人类！那又怎样？我在那里是为了帮助他们，所以我完成了我的工作，不是吗！而且我打算继续这样做，所以别再提你们的战争！”

“But you–” "但是你--"

“But you _what_?” Raziel bared all his teeth. “Did I Fall? Did you see me Fall? No you didn’t. Because I _did my fucking job_.” He leaned forward over the desk. “Now are you going to tell me how to get back there or what?”  
“但是你怎么样？”Raziel露出了他所有的牙齿。“我堕落了吗？你看见我堕落了吗？没有，你没有。因为我他妈的完成了我的工作。”他向前倾身在桌子上。“现在你是要告诉我如何回到那里，还是怎样？”

“G-get back?” The Quartermaster drew himself up in outrage. “You _can’t_ get back! You’re one of us! One of our legion! And you don’t even have your damned body!”  
“回-回去？”军需官愤怒地挺直了身子。“你不能回去！你是我们的一员！我们军团的一员！而且你甚至没有你该死的身体！”

Raziel stared at him in confusion. “What? I don’t?” He held up his hands, then a wide grin lit his face as he saw right through them. “Oh, that makes things easier.”  
拉齐尔困惑地盯着他。“什么？我不明白？”他举起双手，然后脸上露出了灿烂的笑容，因为他看穿了自己的双手。“哦，这样就简单了。”

“Easier?” The Quartermaster was not having a good day.  
“更容易？”军需官今天过得不太顺利。

“Clearly never read my book, did you?” Raziel’s grin bordered in manic. “I know how spirits work and souls and all ties between them and the body.” He turned, sprinting towards the globe.  
“显然你从来没有读过我的书，对吧？”Raziel的笑容带着疯狂的边缘。“我知道灵魂和身体之间的联系，以及它们之间的一切。”他转身向地球仪冲去。

“Oi!” The Quartermaster hurried after him. “You can’t– what are you going to do? Possess them? Like a damned demon?!?”  
“喂！”军需官急忙追了上去。“你不能——你打算做什么？附身他们？像个该死的恶魔一样？！？”

Raziel spun around with a wild laugh. “Bingo!” He turned and slapped his hand against the globe and as he vanished into ether, his voice echoed through the halls, “See ya!”  
雷齐尔狂笑着转了个身。“中了！”他转身用手拍了一下地球仪，随着他消失在虚空中，他的声音在走廊中回荡：“再见！”

The Quartermaster opened and shut his mouth, gaping at the void when the angel had been. He spun and found every single soldier staring at him – and passed him – at the globe. “What the Hell are you lot looking at?!” he screamed, his voice cracking. “Don’t you know there’s a war on?”  
军需官张开嘴巴，看着天使离开后的空无一物，然后又合上嘴巴。他转过身，发现每一个士兵都盯着他看，而且还继续盯着地球仪。"你们在看什么鬼？！"他尖叫道，声音嘶哑。“难道你们不知道正在打仗吗？”

The upper deck of the number 15 bus was deserted.  
15路公交车的上层空无一人。

It hadn’t been when Aziraphale boarded, but within minutes, the passengers had tumbled for the stairs as if the very demons of Hell were on their tail. He ignored them, his hand closed so tight around Crowley’s telephone that the casing and glass were crackling under the pressure.  
当阿齐拉费尔上船时，情况还没有变成这样，但几分钟后，乘客们纷纷冲下楼梯，仿佛地狱的恶魔在追赶他们一样。他无视他们，手紧紧握着克劳利的手机，手机壳和玻璃在压力下发出噼啪声。

There were weapons to be gathered, but he lacked the focus to steal a human and the taxis had all been diverted away from the fire, leaving him stuck in traffic on a God damned bus.  
有武器需要收集，但他缺乏偷走一个人的专注力，而出租车都被引开了，让他被困在堵车的公交车上。

Downstairs, a child was screaming. Aziraphale growled, the rumble ripping through the air and the scream trailed into a whimper.  
楼下传来一个孩子的尖叫声。阿齐拉费尔低声咆哮，隆隆声在空气中回荡，尖叫声渐渐变成了呜咽声。

A plan. He needed a plan. He needed to do more than sit and hold onto the burned and broken remnants of Crowley.  
一个计划。他需要一个计划。他需要做的不仅仅是坐着抓住克劳利被烧毁和破碎的残骸。

He took a slow breath, then forced his fingers to unclench from the telephone, thrusting it into his pocket. The book, still smoking gently, he laid in his lap. Why this book, he wondered. Crowley always seemed so indifferent to them, but this one had been with him when he– as it–  
他慢慢地吸了一口气，然后强迫自己的手指松开电话，将它塞进口袋里。那本书还在轻轻冒烟，他将它放在膝盖上。他想，为什么是这本书呢？克劳利似乎总是对它们漠不关心，但这本书却一直陪伴着他，当他——或者说它——

Aziraphale’s fingers convulsively twitched and he made himself open it, half-expecting it to burn as much as the book of Raziel. He blinked, bewildered, at the colourful child’s drawing on what was clearly a 17<sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="1e3ec84f-e465-4531-b6f4-032cf879a7d0">th</sup> century volume and then he saw the title.  
亚齐拉费尔的手指痉挛地抽动了一下，他强迫自己打开它，半期待着它会像《拉齐尔之书》一样燃烧。他眨了眨眼，对着显然是17世纪的卷轴上的色彩斑斓的儿童画感到困惑，然后他看到了标题。

“Oh fuck me…” "哦，操我…"

_The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter Witch_.  
艾格妮丝·纳特女巫的准确而美好的预言。

Christ, he should be in his book shop with his gloves and a desk cleared for the purpose, but no, he was on a bus that smelled of weed and piss, cradling the rarest of tomes, the ash from the cover flaking all over his fingers.  
他应该在他的书店里，带着手套，桌子上整理好了，专门用来处理这些事情，但是不，他却坐在一辆充满大麻和尿臭味的公交车上，抱着一本稀有的书，书皮上的灰尘在他的手指上脱落。

And… and there were slips of paper sticking out of it at all angles, new paper, but charred at the edges. Gingerly, he opened the pages around the first one, his heart stuttering at the sight of Crowley’s hand-writing in a language he hadn’t seen since… oh, since well before his Fall. The spidery scratched note mentioned a dog. Another, the four horsemen. Another, a series of scribbled names and places and the world Tadfield circled in red.  
然后……然后从各个角度都有纸片从中伸出来，新纸，但边缘被烧焦了。他小心翼翼地打开第一页周围的页面，看到克劳利的手写字迹，他自从……哦，自从他堕落之前就没见过的语言，他的心在看到这些字迹时跳了一下。那张蜘蛛一样的潦草便条提到了一只狗。另一张则提到了四骑士。还有一张，上面写满了一系列的名字、地点，以及用红色圈出的塔德菲尔德。

“Oh…” he breathed, flicking from page to page, from note to note. “Oh, you bloody brilliant angel…”  
"哦..."他喃喃自语，翻动着一页又一页，从一张纸条到另一张纸条。“哦，你这个可恶的天使..."

He’d done it. He’d found the only true prophecy book in the world – and oh, Aziraphale wanted to give him a good hard shake for keeping that a secret – and he’s worked it all out. He had the name of the boy, for God’s sake! The place! The time! Everything and–  
他做到了。他找到了世界上唯一的真正预言书籍——阿齐拉费尔真想给他一个狠狠的摇晃，因为他一直把这个秘密藏着——而且他已经全部弄清楚了。他知道那个男孩的名字，天哪！地点！时间！一切都知道了——

And oh, that was the perfect vengeance.  
哦，那真是完美的报复。

Go to Tadfield. Kill the boy. Save the world. Fuck Heaven and Hell where it hurt the most.  
去塔德菲尔德。杀了那个男孩。拯救世界。他妈的天堂和地狱，让他们受最大的伤害。

“Oi!” “嗨！”

He frowned, looking up. The bus was still empty around him and he glanced to the front, his heart stopping in his chest. He squinted, blinking at the front windscreen. There was a figure, distorted, like a mirage on the horizon, but so recognisable and so, so very dear.  
他皱了皱眉头，抬起头来。公交车周围依然空无一人，他往前看了一眼，心脏瞬间停止了跳动。他眯起眼睛，眨了眨眼睛看着前挡风玻璃。那里有一个身影，扭曲得像地平线上的幻影，但是如此熟悉，如此，如此亲爱。

“Crowley,” he breathed, hand flying to his mouth. “My dear…”  
“克劳利，”他喃喃自语，手飞快地捂住嘴巴。“亲爱的……”

“Aziraphale!” The angel’s translucent face lit up. “Thank God! Been trying to find you for ages!”  
“亚齐拉菲尔！”天使透明的脸庞一下子亮了起来。“谢天谢地！我找了你好久！”

Oh, there was that lovely flutter beneath his ribs. “You– you have?” He snapped the book shut, staggering to his feet and closer to the front of the bus, but Crowley seemed to move further away with every step. “My dear, where _are_ you?”  
哦，他的肋骨下面有一种可爱的颤动。"你-你有吗？"他猛地合上书，摇摇晃晃地站起来，走向公交车前方，但克劳利似乎随着每一步都离他越来越远。"亲爱的，你在哪里？"

“Buggered if I know,” Crowley’s eyes were darting everywhere. “Got myself discorporated. Bit of a balls up, all told.”  
“我他妈的不知道，”克劳利的眼睛四处乱瞄。“我自己都分离了。整个事情都搞砸了。”

“Y-yes,” Aziraphale replied, sinking into the nearest seat, his legs too unsteady to hold. Only discorporated. Only that. No divine wrath or vengeance. Oh thank God for that. Or… not – or _someone_ unaffiliated with either side. He tried to find words, but his throat felt as if it had closed up, his eyes burning.  
“是、是的。”亚齐拉费尔回答道，沉入最近的座位，他的双腿摇摇欲坠无法支撑。只是解体了，只是这样而已。没有神圣的愤怒或复仇。哦，感谢上帝。或者...不，或者是某个与任何一方都无关的人。他试图找到话语，但喉咙仿佛被堵住了，眼睛灼烧着。

“Look, I was trying to get a message to you,” Crowley said urgently. “I had a book at home–”  
“听着，我试图给你传达一个消息。”克劳利急切地说道。“我在家里有一本书——”

“Agnes Nutter!” Aziraphale burst out, holding up the book. “Yes! I was at the church! I found it!”  
“阿格尼丝·纳特！”亚齐拉费尔大声喊道，举起了那本书。“没错！我在教堂里找到了！”

The smile that crossed Crowley’s face was bright and shy. “You were at the church?”  
克劳利脸上浮现出明亮而害羞的微笑。“你在教堂里？”

“Of course, darling! I got your call. I–” He caught himself. “Oh, my dear. I was too late. There was an accident. A fire. The church…”  
“当然，亲爱的！我接到你的电话了。我……”他突然停住了。“哦，亲爱的。我来得太晚了。发生了一场事故。一场火灾。教堂……”

“A fire?” Crowley’s face fell.  
“火灾？”克劳利的脸色一沉。

“I’m sorry, my dear, I was too late.” Aziraphale’s throat ached with effort to keep his voice steady. “But– but I have the book!”  
“对不起，亲爱的，我来晚了。”阿齐拉费尔费力地保持声音稳定，喉咙有些疼痛。“但是，但是我有那本书！”

“Oh. Yes. Right.” Crowley gave a shaky laugh. “Right. The church – I’ve rebuilt it before. But you–we need to get to Tadfield. I mean – you need to get there. I…” He made an impatient sound. “Have you any idea how bloody difficult it is to find a receptive body?”  
“哦。是的。没错。”克劳利颤抖地笑了笑。“没错。教堂——我以前已经重建过了。但是你——我们需要去塔德菲尔德。我的意思是——你需要去那里。我……”他不耐烦地发出了声音。“你知道找到一个愿意接纳的身体有多难吗？”

An automatic response leapt to Aziraphale’s lips, but he bit down on it. Not the time. Definitely not the time, no matter how easy a target it was. “Can I be of any use?”  
阿齐拉费尔的嘴唇上涌起了一个自动回答，但他咬住了它。现在不是时候。绝对不是时候，无论它有多容易成为目标。“我能帮上忙吗？”

“I– can’t be sure. Better not to risk it, not with so much riding on us.”  
“我-不能确定。最好不要冒险，尤其是在我们肩负如此重任的情况下。”

Aziraphale had to bite his lip to messes to keep from responding to that one. Oh the utterly ridiculous idiot was lining up so many ducks and for the first time in his life, Aziraphale could not allow himself to shoot them. “So Tadfield…” He hesitated. “I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, my dear, but the transport network is a little… fucked today.”  
亚齐拉费尔不得不咬住嘴唇，以免对那个问题作出回应。哦，这个完全荒谬的白痴正在安排那么多事情，而亚齐拉费尔却第一次无法让自己去解决它们。“所以，塔德菲尔德……”他犹豫了一下。“亲爱的，我不想给你带来坏消息，但是交通网络今天有点乱。”

Crowley grimaced. “You and your hobbies.” Aziraphale had the good grace not to deny it. “Well… the Bentley? Is it all right?”  
克劳利皱了皱眉头。“你和你的爱好。”阿齐拉费尔没有否认。“嗯...那辆宾利车呢？还好吗？”

“I don’t see how that helps! I don’t know how to drive!”  
我不明白那如何有帮助！我不会开车！

The angel flashed a grin. “And you think I do?” He was fading even as Aziraphale watched. “Bring her with you. She’ll get you to me.”  
天使露出了一个笑容。“你以为我会吗？”当阿齐拉费尔注视着他消失时，他渐渐消失了。“带她一起来。她会带你来找我。”

“It hates me!” He called.  
"它讨厌我！" 他喊道。

Crowley was almost gone from sight, but his words rang back to the demon. “Then she’ll do it for spite.”  
克劳利几乎消失在视线中，但他的话回荡在恶魔的耳畔。“那她会出于恶意而这么做。”

Aziraphale laughed hoarsely. Oh, trust the bloody angel to be smart about it. “Very well, my darling,” he breathed. “I’m coming to Tadfield. You’d better be waiting for me when I get there.”  
亚齐拉费尔嘶哑地笑了起来。哦，信任这个该死的天使会聪明地处理。"好吧，亲爱的，"他喃喃道。"我要去塔德菲尔德了。当我到达那里时，你最好在等我。"

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Travelling in an incorporeal form was _Weird_ with a capital W.  
以无形的形式旅行真是太奇怪了，奇怪到了极点。

Yeah, technically, Crowley had learned the theory at God’s right hand – or more accurately sitting beside the throne with a notepad – but it was very different in practise, and he found that if he willed himself a little east, he’d catapult himself halfway around the world.  
是的，从技术上讲，克劳利在上帝的右手边学习了这个理论——更准确地说是坐在宝座旁边拿着笔记本——但实际操作起来却大不相同。他发现，只要他稍微意愿往东，他就能被弹射到世界的另一半。

It took a dozen attempts, including stumbling through a very nice lady in India, a Bible-thumping evangelist in America, a _very_ confused koala in a zoo in Melbourne (he wasn’t sure who had been more alarmed by the realisation of where he was: himself or the human who had to deal with a koala saying “Oh bugger!”) and a Peruvian coffee vendor.  
经过十几次尝试，包括在印度遇到一位非常友善的女士、在美国遇到一个热衷传教的圣经信徒、在墨尔本动物园遇到一只非常困惑的考拉（他不确定是他自己还是那个必须应对一只考拉说“哦，该死！”的人更为惊慌失措），以及一位秘鲁咖啡摊贩。

At last, he managed to hit what he hoped was London again and opened his eyes to find three people staring at him. A glance took in the room. Chintz and silky drapes and a crystal ball. He lifted his hands, looking at them. Red-nailed fingers, chunky jewellery, definitely female.  
最后，他设法再次击中了他希望的伦敦，并睁开眼睛发现有三个人盯着他。他扫视了一下房间。花呢和丝绸窗帘，还有一个水晶球。他抬起手，看着它们。红色指甲，粗壮的珠宝，明显是女性。

“Er. Hi?” 嗯，嗨？

“Ron?” One of the woman asked. “Is that you?”  
“Ron？”其中一位女士问道。“是你吗？”

“No, actually. Not Ron.” Crowley patted his way up his face. Lady, yes. Caked in make-up. Older than the three in front of him.  
“不，实际上不是罗恩。”克劳利拍了拍自己的脸。女士，是的。浓妆艳抹。比他面前的三个人年长。

_Who the hell are you?  
你到底是谁？_

Crowley blinked sharply. Oh, yes. Demons possessed without regard for their hosts, but that always felt a bit rude, like going into a stranger’s house and rummaging through their knicker drawer after knocking out the owner and locking them in a cupboard. Even ruder because it wasn’t even necessary. _Sorry. I’ll explain in a minute_.  
克劳利猛地眨了眨眼。噢，是的。恶魔们无视宿主而附身，但总觉得有点失礼，就像进入陌生人的家里，在将主人打晕并将其锁在橱柜里后，翻找他们的内衣抽屉一样。更加失礼的是，这样做根本没有必要。抱歉，一会儿我会解释的。

“Excuse me!” The squat woman snapped. “You said you’d get me my Ron! Can you put me through to him?”  
“对不起！”那个矮胖的女人厉声说道。“你说过你会帮我找到我的罗恩！你能把我接通给他吗？”

Crowley stared at the woman, her name and history whispering across his mind. Ah. That would explain the pulse of a spirit nearby. “Ah… you’re Brenda.”  
克劳利盯着那个女人，她的名字和历史在他脑海中低语。啊，这就解释了附近灵魂的脉动。“啊...你就是布伦达。”

“Yes, I’m bleeding Brenda! I’ve been coming here for seven years! You know that!”  
是的，我在流血，布伦达！我已经来这里七年了！你知道的！

Crowley pinched the bridge of his nose. The humans were in the way and he needed to get rid of them.  
克劳利捏了捏鼻梁。这些人挡在了他的路上，他需要摆脱他们。

_Better just give her what she wants, dear_, his host suggested. _Bit of reassurance and comfort to know he’s listening._  
亲爱的，他的主人建议说，最好给她想要的东西。给她一点安慰和舒适，让她知道他在倾听。

Oh, but he was and Crowley could feel the prickle of his energy. “All right, I’ll let her have it.”  
哦，但他确实是这样的，克劳利能感受到他的能量波动。“好吧，我会让她得到它的。”

Maybe it was a little mean of him, but he was in a hurry and playing nice and sweet and letting the woman drone on and on would have helped no one.  And technically, how was he meant to know that Ron Ormerod’s agitated little spirit would turn out to be such a fire cracker?  
也许他有点过分，但他很着急，客气和甜言蜜语只会让那个女人继续啰嗦，对谁都没有帮助。而且从技术上讲，他怎么会知道罗恩·奥默罗德那个焦躁的小灵魂会变成这样一个火爆的人呢？

He could feel the shock and disapproval of his host and withdrew to let her take charge of harrying her guests out of the – hm – seemed to be a flat. The layout looked very familiar, but he couldn’t put his finger on why.  
他能感受到主人的震惊和不满，于是退后一步，让她负责催促客人离开——嗯——似乎是一个公寓。布局看起来非常熟悉，但他无法说出原因。

She returned to the kitchen, putting on the kettle. “Right, my lad,” she said. “Who are you and what the hell’s going on?”  
她回到厨房，放上水壶。“好了，小伙子，”她说。“你是谁，到底发生了什么？”

Crowley would have scratched his chin if he had the hands to do it. “So… here’s the thing,” he began.  
克劳利要是有手的话，他会挠挠下巴。"所以...事情是这样的，"他开始说道。

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

London was a blur and Aziraphale wasn’t enjoying a second of it.  
伦敦一片模糊，阿齐拉费尔一点也不喜欢。

“You don’t have to take the corners so sharply, you bastard!”  
“你不必这么猛地转弯，你这个混蛋！”

The car took a hard left, throwing the demon against the passenger door.  
汽车猛地向左转弯，将恶魔甩到了副驾驶门上。

_Don’t stop me now_, the once-Beethoven CD played, _I’m having such a good time, I’m having a ball_.  
别拦着我，曾经的贝多芬CD在播放，我玩得很开心，过得很愉快。

“Oh I bet you are,” he snarled, clutching at the seat with both hands.  
“哦，我敢打赌你是的，”他咆哮着，双手紧紧抓住座位。

Still, he had to admit Crowley was right about one thing: the damned Bentley was getting him where he needed to do and he didn’t even need to put a hand on the wheel. He’d raced back to the church, ignoring the fighting crowds, the fire engines, the police in riot gear and everything else to reach the Bentley.  
不过，他不得不承认克劳利说对了一件事：这该死的宾利正把他带到他需要去的地方，而他甚至不需要动手握方向盘。他飞快地回到教堂，无视战斗中的人群、消防车、穿着防暴装备的警察以及其他一切，只为赶到宾利身边。

“You and me,” he’d told it in a low growl, “we need to have a talk. Crowley’s in trouble and he needs our help. Are you going to play nice? Or are you going to be the useless machine I know you to be?”  
“你和我，”他低声咆哮着说，“我们需要谈谈。克劳利遇到麻烦了，他需要我们的帮助。你打算表现得友善点吗？还是继续做那个我认识的无用机器？”

The door had swung open so hard it had sent him staggering, which made him grin. Spite, then. He’d considered taking the driver’s seat for the look of the thing, but when he’d tried to open the door again, it locked itself and he was bright enough to take a hint when it was given.  
门被猛力推开，差点让他摇摇晃晃，这让他咧嘴一笑。果然是故意的。他曾考虑过坐在驾驶座上，只是为了好看，但当他试图再次打开门时，它自动锁上了，他聪明地明白了这个暗示。

Of course, things could never go smoothly and as soon as they got out of the thoroughfares of London, the traffic had slowed to a standstill.  
当然，事情永远不可能一帆风顺，一离开伦敦的主干道，交通就完全堵住了。

“What the Heaven…” “天哪…”

_…driven by you…_ the CD skipped.  
由你驱动...CD跳了。

“Oh, don’t you try and pin this one on me!” Aziraphale scowled. “I stopped playing with the motorways when they took away my tollbooths.” He rolled down the window, leaning out to see if he could see what was causing the hold-up. “Tailbacks as far as the eye can see.”  
“哦，你可别把这事怪到我头上！”亚齐拉费尔皱着眉头说道。“他们拆掉我的收费亭后，我就不再玩高速公路了。”他摇下车窗，探出身子看看是什么原因造成了堵塞。“车龙一直延伸到眼前可见的地方。”

_I want to make my final breakthrough_ now  
我现在想要取得最终突破

“Me too, my dear,” Aziraphale murmured. He considered the road again and the narrow margin of road reserved for breakdowns and stranded people. It was utterly empty. “If I can get us as far as the hard shoulder from here…”  
“我也是，亲爱的。”亚齐拉费尔低声说道。他再次考虑了一下路况，以及为故障和困人保留的狭窄路边。那里完全空无一人。“如果我能把我们从这里开到紧急停车带的话……”

The engine hummed. _Is this a kind of magic?_  
引擎嗡嗡作响。这是一种魔法吗？

“Only out of absolute necessity.” He laid both hands on the dashboard. “This is going to _hurt_.”  
只有在绝对必要的情况下。”他双手放在仪表盘上。“这会很痛。”

Sergeant Shadwell woke up in a soft bed surrounded by fluffy animals and leather whips. No man could be blamed for being a wee bit tired after exorcising their first demon, though he carefully looked him finger over for any signs it might go off again.  
沙德韦尔中士在一张柔软的床上醒来，周围是蓬松的动物和皮鞭。第一次驱魔后，谁能不累呢？他小心地检查了一下手指，生怕它再次发作。

It seemed to be disarmed now, so he carefully got up, wincing as his back protested.  
现在看起来好像已经解除了武装，所以他小心地站了起来，背部因为疼痛而略微皱了皱眉。

He could hear voices from the other room and tottered out into Madame Tracy’s lounge. She was nowhere to be seen, but he could hear her talking to some man. He sounded awfy familiar, almost like the wee happy-clappy bugger from the church. The _demon_.  
他听到了另一个房间传来的声音，蹒跚着走进了特蕾西夫人的休息室。她不见了，但他能听到她和一个男人在说话。那个男人的声音听起来非常熟悉，几乎像是教堂里那个讨人喜欢的小恶魔。

“D’you think you’d be able stand having me in you for that long?”  
“你觉得你能忍受我在你里面那么久吗？”

Shadwell’s face flushed and he threw himself around the corner of the room. “Ye’ll be doing no such thing!”  
沙德维尔的脸涨红了，他冲到房间的拐角处。“你可不能这样做！”

He stopped short, staring.  
他突然停下来，目不转睛地盯着。

Madame Tracy looked back at him, eyes round in surprise. “Is everything all right, dear?”  
特蕾西夫人惊讶地回头看着他，“亲爱的，一切都好吗？”

Shadwell scanned the room, squinting at her. “I–I thought–”  
沙德维尔环视房间，眯起眼睛看着她。“我——我以为——”

“Oh, bugger me!” The voice came from Madame Tracy’s mouth, but it was _him_, the namby-pamby, happy-clappy from down the road. “Sergeant Shadwell! What the Hell are you doing here?”  
"哦，我去！"声音从特蕾西夫人的嘴里传出，但那是他，那个软弱无能、快乐无忧的邻居。"沙德威尔警官！你在这里干什么？"

Shadwell recoiled in horror. “Demon!”  
沙德维尔惊恐地退后了一步。“恶魔！”

The demon-in-Madame-Tracy rolled his eyes. “For God’s sake, how many times do I have to tell–”  
恶魔在特蕾西夫人身上翻了个白眼。“天哪，我得告诉你多少次才行…”

“I’ll handle this, dear,” Madame Tracy sounded like herself again and smiled at Shadwell. “Don’t worry, love. Mr. Crowley isn’t what you think he is.”  
“亲爱的，我来处理这件事，”特蕾西夫人恢复了她自己的声音，对着沙德威尔微笑道。“别担心，亲爱的。克劳利先生并不是你想象中的那样。”

Shadwell pointed his shaking finger at her. “Dinnae fear, Jezebel! I’ll cast that demon from you with a word! I’ll blast him to Kingdom Come!”  
沙德威尔颤抖着指着她。“别害怕，耶洗别！我会用一句话把那个恶魔赶走！我会把他炸到王国的尽头！”

Madame Tracy gave him the soft wee smile she gave him when he dropped off his dishes. “That’s the trouble, love,” she said, taking his hand between both of hers. “Kingdom Come. It’s coming. Now, come here…” She pulled him around. “Have a seat and I’ll make us a cup of tea and Mr. Crowley will explain everything.”  
特蕾西夫人给了他一个温柔的微笑，就像他放下盘子时给他的那样。“这就是问题，亲爱的，”她说着，双手握住他的手。“天国降临了。它即将到来。现在，过来吧……”她把他拉过来。“坐下，我给我们泡杯茶，克劳利先生会解释一切的。”

Thing had gone from very bad, to somehow so much worse.  
事情已经从很糟糕变得更糟糕了。

Aziraphale was aching all over. Transporting himself was uncomfortable at the best of times, but several tonnes of vintage Bentley with all the trimmings had really taken it out of him, and it had all been for nothing.  
亚齐拉费尔浑身酸痛。无论何时，自行传送都令他感到不舒服，而携带着几吨装饰华丽的老式宾利车更是让他筋疲力尽，而且这一切都是徒劳无功。

They’d been careening along the hard shoulder at illegal speeds when red light had bloomed on the horizon and up ahead, a wall of flame had spread in both directions. For once, the Bentley didn’t comment as he fiddled with the radio, searching for some update of what the hell was going on.  
他们一直以非法的速度在硬肩上疾驰，当地平线上出现了红光，前方一道火墙向两边蔓延。这一次，那辆宾利没有发表评论，他在调整收音机，寻找一些关于到底发生了什么的更新信息。

It turned out that the M25 was on fire.  
原来M25着火了。

Not just a little bit near an accident. Not just a small stretch. Oh, no. The ringroad that wrapped around London in a perfect closed loop had turned into a blazing inferno, and he had a horrible feeling he knew why.  
不仅仅是接近事故的一点点。不仅仅是一小段路程。哦，不。环绕伦敦的环城公路形成了一个完美的封闭环，如今却变成了一片熊熊燃烧的地狱，他有一种可怕的预感，知道其中的原因。

He and Crowley had been drunk some time in the 70s – not an uncommon occurrence – and daring each other to come up with the wildest miracles or temptations they could come up with. Crowley, lying on the couch with his legs dangling over the back, declared he could make the M25 either the best thing since fermentation or the worst thing to crawl out of the pit since time immemorial (“after you, f’course” he’d added with a bleary upside-down grin at Aziraphale).  
他和克劳利在70年代的某个时候喝醉了——这并不罕见——他们互相挑战，看谁能想出最疯狂的奇迹或诱惑。克劳利躺在沙发上，双腿悬在背后，宣称他可以让M25成为自发酵以来最好的东西，或者是自古以来从深渊爬出来的最糟糕的东西（“当然是你先来”他朝阿齐拉费尔迷迷糊糊地倒过来笑了笑）。

“Bollocks, he remembered saying. “It’s a bit of road.”  
“胡说八道，他记得自己说过。“这只是一段路而已。”

“Yeah,” Crowley had agreed, “but if you make it into an occult symbol, tell them downstairs that it’s some weird summoning thing and make up some rubbish about it being a toilet bowl for festering grumpy travellers, it’d sound good, yeah?” He yawned and waggled a foot at the ceiling. “S’a motorway. People are going to be miserable bastards on it anyway. Might as well get some extra credit for no work, eh?”  
“是啊，”克劳利同意道，“但如果你把它变成一个神秘的符号，告诉楼下的人它是某种奇怪的召唤物，然后编造一些关于它是供脾气暴躁的旅行者使用的马桶的胡言乱语，听起来不错，对吧？”他打了个哈欠，用脚在天花板上晃了晃。“这是一条高速公路。人们在上面本来就会很糟糕。不如为没有付出努力而获得一些额外的好处，对吧？”

Aziraphale had thought about it, they’d drunk some more, then he’d dug through his almanacs when he got home and found the dread sigil Odegra in the language of Ancient Mu, which was close enough to the design for the new motorway. He’d had to use bribery for some of the more technical parts and even traipsed through a couple of fields one night, but downstairs had been suitably impressed with his genius.  
亚齐拉费尔曾经考虑过这个问题，他们喝了一些酒，然后回到家后翻阅了他的年鉴，找到了古代穆文中可怕的符号奥德格拉，它与新高速公路的设计相似。他不得不贿赂一些技术性更强的部分，甚至在一个晚上穿过几个田地，但楼下对他的天才印象深刻。

Several months later, Crowley had shouted at him about that and then got embarrassed when he realised that it was mostly his fault.  
几个月后，克劳利对他大声喊叫，然后意识到这主要是他自己的错而感到尴尬。

“We really need to stop having ideas when we’re drunk, darling,” Aziraphale murmured, staring out at the blistering wall of flame. The Great Beast was coming. Of course the sigil would activate. He groped down in the foot well for the smoke-stained book of prophecies and lifted it into his lap, flipping it open. “I don’t suppose you have any advice, Agnes…”  
“亲爱的，我们真的需要在喝醉的时候停止产生想法。”阿齐拉费尔低声说道，凝视着那道炽热的火墙。巨兽即将来临。当然，那个印记会被激活。他在脚下的垫子里摸索着那本被烟熏的预言书，将它放在膝上，翻开了书页。“我想你也没有什么建议，阿格尼丝……”

A hand slapped down on the open page, filthy and boil-speckled and he stared at it in horror, following up the arm to the face of the demon in the driver’s – in _Crowley_’s seat.  
一只肮脏、布满疮痕的手狠狠地拍在打开的书页上，他惊恐地盯着它，顺着手臂看向驾驶座上恶魔的脸——克劳利的座位上。

Hastur smiled unpleasantly at him. He stank of singed rosemary. “Hello, Aziraphale.”  
哈斯特对他笑得令人不悦。他身上散发着烧焦迷迭香的味道。“你好，阿齐拉费尔。”

“Hastur…” Aziraphale swallowed around the lump in his throat. “I see you’re out and about again.”  
“哈斯特……”阿齐拉费尔喉咙里有个难以启齿的东西。 “看来你又出来活动了。”

“Shouldn’t have left your shop lying open like that,” the demon said, tutting. “Any little human might worry and come and check on the poor old man on the floor.” His lips drew back from his mossy teeth. “And running away?” He hissed. “No, I don’t think there’s anywhere you can go, do you?”  
“你不该让你的店门敞开着，”恶魔嘀咕道。“任何一个小人类都可能会担心并前来查看躺在地板上的可怜老人。”他露出了青苔般的牙齿。“还逃跑？”他嘶嘶地说。“不，我觉得你没地方可去，你觉得呢？”

Aziraphale glanced out the windscreen at the wall of fire up ahead. He reached forward, pressing a hand to the dashboard and heard the CD switch on again. _The show must go on._  
亚齐拉费尔朝前方的挡风玻璃瞥了一眼，眼前是一堵熊熊燃烧的火墙。他伸手向前，按住仪表盘，听到CD重新启动。秀必须继续进行。

“You know Hell will not forgive you for this, nor will they forget,” Hastur said with what Aziraphale felt was unnecessary glee.  
“你知道地狱不会原谅你这件事，他们也不会忘记。”哈斯图尔说着，阿齐拉费尔觉得他的喜悦显得有些过分。

“Mm. Good point. Well-made.” Aziraphale looked back at him. “Which makes you wonder what I might be willing to do, if I know I’m already fucked.” He grinned at the demon and knocked the dashboard. “Shall we go for a spin?”  
“嗯，说得不错。做得很好。”亚齐拉费尔回头看着他。“这让你想知道，如果我知道自己已经完蛋了，我可能愿意做些什么。”他冲恶魔笑了笑，敲了敲仪表盘。“我们去兜风吧？”

Hastur’s face crumpled. “You what?”  
哈斯特的脸皱了起来。“你说什么？”

A drumbeat was picking up through the speakers, a bass thrumming, and Aziraphale’s grin widened as the car picked up speed.  
从扬声器中传来了一个鼓点，低音嗡嗡作响，随着车速的增加，阿齐拉费尔的笑容变得更加灿烂。

_And we’re rushing headlong, I got a new goal, and we’re rushing headlong, out of control  
而我们正在匆忙前进，我有一个新目标，而我们正在匆忙前进，失去了控制_

“Wh-what are you doing?” Hastur looked wildly between him and the rapidly-approaching wall of flames and Aziraphale couldn’t keep himself from laughing. “You’re going to discorporate us both!”  
“你、你在干什么？”哈斯特惊慌地看着他和迅速逼近的火墙，而阿齐拉费尔忍不住笑了起来。“你要把我们都解体！”

“Oh, this isn’t me, my dear,” he said, stroking a hand along the dashboard. “Say hello to my little friend!”  
“哦，亲爱的，这不是我，”他说着，用手抚摸着仪表盘。“向我的小伙伴打个招呼！”

“You’re mad!” Hastur wailed, flinging up his arms to shield his face as they plunged into the flames.  
“你疯了！”哈斯图尔嚎叫着，举起双臂遮住脸，随着他们跌入火焰之中。

The demon’s skin started sizzling and Aziraphale had to admit he was starting to feel a bit warm himself, but he knew for a fact the bastard car would get them to Crowley purely out of spite, a fact he believed as much as Crowley believed they would get to him in time.  
恶魔的皮肤开始发出嘶嘶声，亚齐拉费尔不得不承认他自己也开始感到有些热了，但他确信该死的车子会纯粹出于恶意将他们送到克劳利那里，这一点他和克劳利一样坚信，他们会及时赶到他那里。

What neither of them realised was faith could be far more powerful in _any_ direction. Belief had a power all of its own, and the sheer force of the combined belief of an angel and a demon had some very interesting effects on a well-loved vintage Bentley.  
他们两个都没有意识到的是，信仰在任何方向上都可以更加强大。信念本身就有一种力量，而一个天使和一个恶魔的信念的结合力对一辆深受喜爱的老式宾利车产生了一些非常有趣的影响。

“You’re doomed!” Hastur screamed as flames licked out of his skin. “DOOMED!”  
“你注定要完蛋了！”哈斯特大喊着，火焰从他的皮肤上舔舐而出。“完蛋了！”

“What can I say?” Aziraphale laughed. “I know how to make a dramatic exit!”  
“我能说什么呢？”亚齐拉费尔笑着说道。“我知道如何做一个引人注目的离开！”

The other demon’s screams were swallowed as the flames engulfed him, a lingering “I hate you!” hanging on the air.  
另一个恶魔的尖叫声在火焰吞噬他的同时消失了，一句挥之不去的“我恨你！”在空气中挂着。

Aziraphale grinned, bracing his hands on the dashboard. “Enjoying yourself, you bastard?”  
亚齐拉费尔咧嘴一笑，双手撑在仪表盘上。“玩得开心吗，你这个混蛋？”

A throbbing bass thrummed over the flames.  
一阵有力的低音随着火焰的燃烧震撼着空气。

_And another one down, and another one down, and another one bites the dust_. _Hey, I’m gonna get you too, another one bites the dust_  
又一个倒下，又一个倒下，又一个被击倒。嘿，我也会抓住你，又一个被击倒。

As they tore through the flames, Aziraphale howled with laughter.  
当他们穿越熊熊烈火时，阿齐拉费尔放声大笑。

Crowley was tired. 克劳利很累。

A human body was a lot more exhausting than he’d anticipated, especially when he’d forced a miracle or two to get them safely out of London. They sailed over the M25 which was, for some bizarre reason, on fire. The more he tried not to think about the cause, the more he had an awful feeling he knew exactly what was behind it.  
一个人的身体比他预期的要累得多，尤其是当他不得不施展一两个奇迹，将他们安全地带离伦敦时。他们飞越了M25高速公路，而这条路竟然在火焰中燃烧着，这让他感到非常奇怪。他越是试图不去想火灾的原因，就越是有一种糟糕的预感，他清楚地知道背后的真相。

It didn’t help that Marjorie insisted on being a backseat driver and keeping a running commentary on everything that they were doing, from how wonderful it was to see her old scooter going so fast to how nice Mr. Shadwell’s arms felt around her middle. That, the angel decided, as they finally trundled up to the gates of the airbase, he could have lived without.  
这并没有帮上忙，因为玛乔丽坚持要当个后座驾驶员，并对他们所做的一切进行不断的评论，从她的旧摩托车跑得多快多好，到沙德维尔先生的手臂在她腰间的感觉多么舒服。天使决定，他本可以没有这些。当他们最终缓缓驶向空军基地的大门时。

_I can hear your thoughts too, Mr. Crowley.  
我也能听到你的想法，克劳利先生。_

Crowley winced. _Yes, I know_. “Here we are.”  
克劳利皱了皱眉头。是的，我知道。“我们到了。”

“How are we meant to get in there?” she asked. “The fences are awfully high.”  
“我们怎么进去？”她问道。“围栏太高了。”

It was one thing to fly all the way from London. It was another to risk being a UFO over an American Air Base fence, especially with their tendency to be very trigger-happy.  
从伦敦飞过来已经是一回事了。冒着成为美国空军基地围墙上的不明飞行物的风险，尤其是考虑到他们很容易开枪，那就是另外一回事了。

“Dinnae worry,” Shadwell said, though he sounded considerably shakier than he had when they left London. “I have the power of the Almighty on my side.”  
“别担心，”沙德维尔说道，尽管他的声音比离开伦敦时要虚弱得多。“全能者的力量与我同在。”

“Oh God…” Crowley groaned. “Sergeant, if I – a bonafide angel – can’t do it, I think we can safely say your Witchfinder status carries considerably less weight.” He turned, striding towards the guard post where an over-enthusiastic man was standing. “Hello… army human. We need to get into your base. We have to speak to whoever is in charge.”  
“哦天啊…” 克劳利叹息道。“中士，如果我——一个真正的天使——都做不到，我想我们可以放心地说，你的巫师审判者身份的分量要小得多。” 他转身朝着警卫亭走去，那里站着一个过于热情的人。“嗨… 军队的人类。我们需要进入你们的基地。我们必须与负责人交谈。”

“I’m sorry, ma’am,” the soldier said brusquely. “We do not allow unauthorised visits.”  
“对不起，女士，”士兵粗暴地说道。“我们不允许未经授权的访问。”

“Unauthor–” Crowley spluttered indignantly. “I’ve come a long way to stop the end of the world and you’re blocking me with formalities?”  
“未经授–” 克劳利愤慨地咳嗽着。“我赶了很远的路来阻止世界末日，你却用形式主义阻挡我？”

“The… end of the world?” The soldier tightened his hands around his gun. “You’re not some of those crazy peace-and-love protesters from the village, are you?”  
"世界...末日？" 士兵紧紧握住手中的枪。“你们不会是那个村子里那些疯狂的和平与爱的抗议者吧？”

“Oh for Heav– no! No, I’m not a peace-and-love protester!” Crowley threw up his hands. “I’m here, trying to stop the literal Antichrist from ending the very literal world in an absolutely literal Armageddon situation!”  
“哦，天哪！不！不，我不是一个和平与爱的抗议者！”克劳利举起双手。“我在这里，试图阻止字面上的大敌基督结束非常真实的世界，在绝对字面上的末日战争局势中！”

“He’s telling the truth!” Marjorie piped up.  
"他说的是真的！" 玛乔丽大声说道。

“Can you _not_ do that for five minutes?” Crowley said, clenching his – her – their hands.  
“你能不能五分钟不要这样做？”克劳利说着，紧握着他（她）们的手。

“Sorry, love!” “对不起，亲爱的！”

The man’s face twisted. “Can you both – uh – ma’am, I’m gonna have to ask you to leave. This is a restricted…” His words trailed off and he stared passed them, the look of frustration giving way to something more like shock. “Holy…”  
男人的脸扭曲了起来。“你们俩能不能……呃……女士，我得请你们离开。这是一个受限制的……”他的话断了下来，他的目光穿过他们，挫败的表情变成了更像是震惊。“天啊……”

Crowley spun around and the very mortal heart in his borrowed chest thundered.  
克劳利转身，借来的胸膛里的凡人心脏轰鸣起来。

The Bentley! 宾利！

He swayed on his feet in horror. It was burning, flames streaming from every part of it as it roared towards them. Nothing living could’ve survived that. Yeah, he’d been so _sure_ the Bentley would make it from London, but just because he believed it didn’t mean– oh God. He’d seen the flames as they hurtled over the M25. He should’ve thought, should’ve told Aziraphale not to–  
他惊恐地站立不稳。它在燃烧，火焰从它的每个部分涌出，向他们呼啸而来。没有任何生物能够在那样的情况下幸存。是的，他曾经非常确信那辆宾利能够从伦敦到达，但仅仅因为他相信并不意味着——哦，天啊。他看到了火焰从M25高速公路上飞过的情景。他应该考虑一下，应该告诉阿齐拉费尔不要——

_I’m sure he’ll be all right, love_.  
亲爱的，我相信他会没事的。

“No,” he began to say, when the passenger door burst open and a smoking, but oh so familiar figure hurled themselves out, smoke rolling from a suit that must have once been pale but now was so sooty and oily, it was barely even recognisable.  
“不！”他刚要说，当乘客门突然被撞开，一个冒着烟的，但是如此熟悉的身影从车里扑了出来，烟雾从一套曾经可能是浅色的但现在已经被煤烟和油污弄得脏兮兮的西装上升腾而起，以至于几乎无法辨认。

Aziraphale. 阿齐拉费尔。

Crowley’s breath exploded out of his body in a gasp, his hands leaping to his mouth.  
克劳利的呼吸突然间喘息着从他的身体中爆发出来，双手猛地捂住了嘴巴。

Aziraphale stumbled to his feet, panting. “Good car,” he rasped hoarsely. “Well done, you bastard.” He straightened up, coughing out rings of smoke and gulping in breaths of air, and then his red-rimmed eyes – solid blue now – fixed on Crowley. The smile that lit his face was almost angelic, and he staggered forward. “My dear, oh my _dear_.”  
亚齐拉费尔费力地站起身来，喘着气说道：“好车，你这混蛋做得好。”他挺直了身子，咳出一圈圈烟雾，大口吸气，然后他那红肿的眼睛——现在变成了纯蓝色——盯着克劳利。他脸上浮现出的微笑几乎像天使一样，他踉跄着向前走去。“亲爱的，哦，亲爱的。”

“Aziraphale…” Crowley felt like a newborn giraffe, tottering on legs that didn’t want to hold him.  
“亚齐拉费尔……”克劳利感觉自己像一只新生的长颈鹿，踉跄地站在不愿支撑他的腿上。

The demon laughed, covering the space between them and before Crowley could hold out his hands to warn him or stop him, Aziraphale pulled him into a hug, wrapping him up in smoky arms, his breath a hot gust against Crowley’s ear.  
恶魔笑了起来，将他们之间的空间填满。克劳利还没来得及伸手警告或阻止，亚齐拉费尔就把他拥入怀中，用烟雾般的双臂将他紧紧包裹，热气喷在克劳利的耳边。

“Oh, my darling,” the demon’s voice trembled and broke. “You’re back.”  
"哦，我的亲爱，" 那个恶魔的声音颤抖着，断断续续地说道，"你回来了。"

### Chapter Text 章节正文

Life had returned to Aziraphale’s world.  
生活已经回到了阿齐拉费尔的世界。

After the wild ride in flames, clinging to the seat of the Bentley and roaring obscenities at the bloody stupid vehicle, daring it to fall apart or let him burn and really disappoint Crowley, he had stumbled out to blissfully cool air.  
在熊熊烈火中经历了一场疯狂的旅程后，他紧紧抓住宾利的座椅，对着这辆该死的愚蠢车辆大声咒骂，挑衅它散架或者让他烧死，以此来真正让克劳利失望。最后，他艰难地走出车内，感受到了宜人的凉爽空气。

And then he had felt the familiar wonderful pulse of the angel’s presence and through eyes hazed with smoke and dust and heat, he had spotted the shape of him in a human form a dozen paces away.  
然后他感受到了熟悉而美妙的天使存在的脉动，透过被烟雾、尘土和炎热模糊的眼睛，他发现了一个十步之遥的人形身影。

No reasonable person – no demon especially – could have been expected to keep to himself.  
没有一个理智的人，尤其是没有一个恶魔，可以指望他保持沉默。

Crowley stiffened in his embrace, startled, then seemed to sag, as a puppet with strings cut and wrapped his arms tightly around the demon, as if he could scarcely believe it as well.  
克劳利在他的拥抱中僵硬了起来，吃了一惊，然后似乎松弛下来，就像一个被剪断了线的木偶，他紧紧地抱住了那个恶魔，仿佛他自己也难以置信。

“Found a new body, I see.” Aziraphale managed to say, his voice roughened by a solid hour of shouting at the Bentley. He, of course, wouldn’t have been himself if he didn’t take full opportunity of the angel’s willing proximity and gave said new body a firm squeeze on the backside.  
“看到你找到新伙伴了。”阿齐拉费尔勉强说道，他的声音因为对宾利车大声喊叫了整整一个小时而变得嘶哑。当然，如果他不充分利用天使近在咫尺的机会，给这个新伙伴的屁股来个有力的捏一下，他就不会是他自己了。

Crowley reared back instantly, and someone else entirely smacked Aziraphale sharply across the face. “Cheeky!”  
克劳利立刻后退了一步，而完全是另一个人狠狠地扇了阿齐拉费尔一巴掌。“傲慢！”

Aziraphale blinked in astonishment. “I beg your pardon, but who the Hell are you?”  
亚齐拉费尔惊讶地眨了眨眼睛。“请原谅，但你到底是谁？”

Crowley laughed a little shakily. “Bit of a sublet situation going on for now,” he said through the woman’s mouth. “Aziraphale, Marjorie. Marjorie, Aziraphale.”  
克劳利有些颤抖地笑了笑。“现在有一点转租的情况，”他通过这个女人的嘴说道。“阿齐拉费尔，这位是玛乔丽。玛乔丽，阿齐拉费尔。”

Aziraphale raised his eyebrows. Of course the bloody angel couldn’t even possess someone properly. He caught the hand that hand slapped him, sweeping it up to his lips and kissed her knuckles gallantly. “Madame.”  
亚齐拉费尔挑起了眉毛。当然，这该死的天使连合体都做不好。他抓住那只打了他一巴掌的手，将其抬到嘴唇上，优雅地亲吻她的指节。“夫人。”

“Oh, _hello_…” Her expression brightened. “He’s been hoping you’d turn up.”  
"哦，你好..." 她的表情变得明亮起来。"他一直希望你能出现。"

Crowley’s expression twitched on her face. “We’re having a bit of trouble getting in,” he admitted, jerking his head beyond – oh, hello – Sergeant Shadwell towards the bewildered soldier, who was still hopefully pointing his gun at them in turn, as if he expected to use it.  
克劳利的表情在她脸上扭动了一下。“我们进来有点麻烦，”他承认道，把头一甩，指向那个困惑的士兵，他仍然满怀希望地把枪对准他们，仿佛他打算使用它一样。

“I don’t know who you people are, but I’m gonna have to ask you to–”  
“我不知道你们是谁，但我得要求你们——”

“Oh, he’s a handsome one, isn’t he?” Aziraphale said, grinning as the human backed up with clear no-homo panic written all over his face. It always astonished him how wretchedly puritanical certain types could be. “I could–”  
“哦，他真帅，不是吗？”亚齐拉费尔笑着说道，看着那个人脸上明显写满了不同性向的恐慌。某些人的道德观念总是让他感到惊讶，多么狭隘保守啊。“我可以……”

Whatever he could do utterly slipped his mind when someone slapped him hard on the backside.  
当有人狠狠地拍了他的屁股一下时，他完全忘记了自己能做的任何事情。

He turned, wide-eyed, to Crowley, who stared back at him, just as wide-eyed.  
他转过头，眼睛睁得大大的，看着克劳利，而克劳利也睁大眼睛盯着他。

“Marjorie!” “玛乔丽！”

Marjorie gave Aziraphale an apologetic grin. “Sorry, dear. That one was me.” She leaned a little closer and added, “But it was his ide–” Her hands clamped over her mouth, Crowley’s blush spreading all over the woman’s face.  
玛乔丽给了阿齐拉费尔一个道歉的笑容。“对不起，亲爱的。那是我的错。”她靠近了一点，补充道，“但这是他的主意——”她的手猛地捂住了嘴，克劳利的脸红润扩散到了玛乔丽的脸上。

“Oh, I _like_ this one!” Aziraphale laughed, delighted.  
"哦，我喜欢这个！"亚齐拉费尔开心地笑了起来。

“Sir! Ma’am!” The soldier wailed, waving his gun between them. “_Please_!”  
“先生！女士！” 士兵哭喊着，挥舞着枪在他们之间。“拜托！”

“We need to…” Crowley waved urgently towards the gates.  
“我们需要……” 克劳利急切地朝大门挥手。

A snap of Aziraphale’s fingers dismissed the contents of the weapon. “Well, shall we–”  
阿齐拉费尔的手指一弹，武器的内容消失了。“好了，我们要……”

Behind the soldier’s the gates, rattled open and the poor boy swung around in time to see a fleet of small, frantically-pedalling children whizzing into the base.  
士兵身后的大门嘎然打开，可怜的男孩及时转过身，看到一群小孩子疯狂地蹬着脚踏车冲进了基地。

“Hey! You! You kids!” The soldier ran back towards the guard booth.  
“嘿！你们！你们这些孩子！”士兵跑回了警卫亭。

Crowley stepped closer to Aziraphale’s elbow. “D’you think…?”  
克劳利走近阿齐拉费尔的肘部。“你觉得呢……？”

Aziraphale nodded, tracking the progress of the children. “One of–”  
亚齐拉费尔点了点头，注视着孩子们的进展。“其中之一——”

His words were cut off by an explosion behind them, the blast making Crowley stagger into him. He caught the angel-human’s arm and turned, his stomach twisting as he saw the chassis of the Bentley give way, the flaming ruin of the car collapsing in on itself.  
他的话被身后的一声爆炸打断了，爆炸冲击使克劳利向他倒退。他抓住了这位天使人类的手臂，转过身去，他的胃扭曲了，因为他看到宾利的车身崩溃了，车子成为了一堆燃烧的废墟。

“Oh…” Crowley’s arm trembled under his hand. “Oh, my dear…”  
“哦……” 克劳利的手下颤抖着。“哦，亲爱的……”

Crowley pulled away, tottering on the kitten heels towards the burning car.  
克劳利摇摇晃晃地走开，朝着燃烧的汽车走去，脚上的小高跟鞋发出咯吱咯吱的声音。

“Is that…” Marjorie started to ask.  
“那是……”玛乔丽开始问道。

“His car,” Aziraphale said, hurrying after her and catching their shoulder. “Crowley, my dear…”  
“他的车。”亚齐拉费尔说着，匆匆追了上去，抓住了他们的肩膀。“克劳利，亲爱的……”

Crowley’s voice broke. “I’d had her from new. Now look…”  
克劳利的声音颤抖了起来。“我从一开始就拥有她。现在看看……”

“I know, my dear, I know.” Aziraphale squeezed his shoulder. “She did you proud, you know. Stubborn old bitch helped me get away from Hastur. She came here for you. She knew we needed to be here.” He tightened his grip. “She was a damned good car.”  
“我知道，亲爱的，我知道。”亚齐拉费尔紧紧地握住他的肩膀。“她为你感到骄傲，你知道吗？这个固执的老婊子帮助我逃离了哈斯特。她来这里是为了你。她知道我们需要在这里。”他加紧了握力。“她是一辆非常好的车。”

Crowley nodded, reaching up to clasp his hand. “She was.”  
克劳利点了点头，伸手握住了他的手。“是的，她是。”

Aziraphale nudged him gently. “And still hated me, right to the end. Threatened me several times. Very effectively as well.”  
亚齐拉费尔轻轻地推了他一下。“一直到最后都恨我。威胁过我好几次。而且非常有效。”

The angel gave a small, damp laugh. “Sounds like her.” He sniffed hard, gathering himself, perhaps spurred on by his temporary sublet. “Right. Yes… yes, we– I need to– the boy. We need to find him.”  
天使发出了一声轻微而潮湿的笑声。“听起来像她。”他用力地嗅了嗅，收拾了一下自己，也许是被他暂时的租住所激励了。“对。是的……是的，我们——我需要——那个男孩。我们需要找到他。”

Aziraphale glanced back towards the fence and the excitable American who was shouting even more excitedly into a radio. No wonder, if a car had just exploded outside their base and they had been invaded by a force of determined pre-pubescents.  
亚齐拉费尔朝着篱笆望了一眼，那个兴奋的美国人正更加兴奋地对着收音机大声喊叫。难怪，如果他们的基地外刚刚发生了一辆汽车爆炸，并且被一群决心坚定的青春期前来入侵的人占领，那么他们会如此激动。

“My dear,” he asked, as they strode back towards Shadwell – who, for some inexplicable reason was waving his forefinger around as if it was some kind of weapon – and the gates, “I don’t mean to sound skeptical, but how… effective are your powers in that body?”  
“亲爱的，”他问道，他们一起朝着沙德韦尔走去——不知为何，沙德韦尔挥舞着食指，仿佛它是某种武器——并且走向大门，“我不是要怀疑，但你在那个身体里的能力有多有效？”

“Good enough,” Crowley said with a hint of a growl in his voice. “I didn’t come back to be useless. I flew us here from London.”  
“够好了。”克劳利的声音中带着一丝低沉的咆哮。“我回来可不是为了无用。我从伦敦飞过来的。”

“He _is_ a bit tired, though,” Marjorie put in.  
"他有点累，不过," 玛乔丽补充道。

“Would you _stop_ doing that!”  
你能停止那样做吗？

Aziraphale gave them a thoughtful look, then glanced beyond the fence. A jeep packed with armed soldiers was heading rapidly in their direction on the other side of the gates. “Don’t worry, darlings,” he said, stepping ahead of them. “I’ll get us a ride.”  
亚齐拉费尔注视着他们，然后瞥了一眼篱笆外面。一辆装满武装士兵的吉普车正迅速朝他们的方向驶来，门的另一边。“别担心，亲爱的，”他走到他们前面说道。“我会给我们找辆车。”

Adam looked at them. 亚当看着他们。

Not his Them, but the other them. They were meant to be his friends. A voice in his head was shouting that they were meant to be his friends, but all he could see was the shape of them and what they were made of and they were rubbish.  
不是他们，而是另外的他们。他们本应是他的朋友。他脑海中有个声音在喊着他们本应是他的朋友，但他所能看到的只是他们的形状和他们的本质，而它们是一堆垃圾。

His Them were _much_ better than any stupid old nightmares.  
他们比任何愚蠢的老噩梦都要好得多。

“Your very existence demands the ending of the world.” Death’s voice rang right through his head and down to his bones. “You could finish this for them with one thought. You could make the world anew.”  
你的存在本身就要求世界的终结。”死神的声音在他的脑海中回响，直至骨子里。“你只需一个念头，就能为他们结束这一切。你可以让世界重生。”

“There!” “在那里！”

“Aziraphale, slow down!” 亚齐拉费尔，慢点！

“Unlikely, my dear! Easier to squash them in a ca–”  
“亲爱的，不太可能！把它们压扁在一个...”

Adam turned and watched with interest as a jeep – which had been going at full speed – braked suddenly, tyres screeching, spinning to a stop. There were three – no, wait – four people in. Three bodies, four people. Weird.  
亚当转过身来，饶有兴趣地看着一辆吉普车突然刹车，轮胎尖叫着，旋转着停了下来。车里有三个人，不对，等等，是四个人。三具尸体，四个人。奇怪。

Death took a step forward. “No one will disobey–”  
死神向前迈出一步。“没有人会违抗——”

“Damn it, Crowley!” The… oh, yes, a demon jumped out of the car. He looked like he’d been on fire, which made sense if he was a demon.  
“该死的，克劳利！”哦，是的，一只恶魔从车里跳了出来。他看起来像是被火烧过一样，这对于一个恶魔来说是合理的。

“You can’t kill him!” The little old lady with an angel on her shoulders ran after him, grabbing his arm.  
“你不能杀他！”肩上有一个天使的小老太太追着他跑过来，抓住了他的胳膊。

“Watch me!” The demon looked over at the Them and met Adam’s eyes. He stopped dead, baring his teeth like an angry cat.  
“看着我！”恶魔看向他们，与亚当对视。他突然停下来，像一只愤怒的猫一样露出牙齿。

“No!” The old lady’s voice mixed with the voice of someone who was and wasn’t there. “Aziraphale, you _can’t_! Shadwell!”  
“不！”老太太的声音与一个既在又不在的声音混合在一起。“阿齐拉费尔，你不能这样做！沙德威尔！”

The other man on the car shuffled forward. He had a big trumpet-thing. “Aye?”  
车上的另一个男人向前挪动了一下。他手里拿着一个大喇叭状的东西。“嗯？”

The woman-angel pointed. “That’s him! The curly one! Shoot him, save the world!”  
那个女天使指着。“就是他！那个卷发的！射击他，拯救世界！”

The only human out of them stared at Adam. “But he’s just a wee bairn.”  
他们中的唯一一个人盯着亚当看着。“但他只是个小孩子。”

“For Satan’s sake!” The demon snatched the trumpet thing from the old man, but the old-lady-angel grabbed it. “Angel, let _go_!”  
“为了撒旦的缘故！”恶魔从老人手中抢过那个喇叭状物品，但老太太天使抓住了它。“天使，放手！”

“You _can’t_ kill him!” The angel protested. “They’ll destroy you if you do!” He wrenched the trumpet-thing out of the demon’s hands. “I should–”  
“你不能杀了他！”天使抗议道。“如果你这样做，他们会毁灭你的！”他从恶魔手中夺过那个喇叭状物。“我应该……”

Ah. It was a gun. Right. That made sense. Being shot was probably a bad thing.  
啊，是一把枪。对，这很有道理。被射击可能是件坏事。

“Ignore this nonsense,” Death interrupted again, but Adam was watching the angel and the old lady. They were arguing now and fighting over the gun with the demon. “A word from you and I will end their lives.”  
“别理这些废话。”死神再次打断，但亚当却一直在注视着天使和老太太。他们现在正在争吵，并与恶魔争夺枪支。“只要你说一个字，我就会结束他们的生命。”

He would as well. Could. Just like that. Adam didn’t know how he knew, and then he did.  
他也可以。就这样。亚当不知道他是怎么知道的，然后他知道了。

“You can’t just kill children!”  
你不能随便杀孩子！

The old lady and angel had the gun again. Her eyes were open, but Adam saw the way the angel’s thousands of eyes pressed shut as he aimed the gun. He didn’t want to and the old lady stopped it, pulling the angel’s hands up as he tried to make himself pull the trigger. It went off like a firework.  
老太太和天使又拿起了枪。她的眼睛睁着，但亚当看到天使的成千上万只眼睛在他瞄准枪时紧闭。他不想这样做，老太太阻止了他，抬起天使的手，阻止他扣动扳机。枪像烟花一样爆炸了。

“I’m sorry!” The old lady sounded like was going to cry. “I couldn’t let you do it.”  
“对不起！”老太太的声音听起来像是要哭了。“我不能让你这么做。”

The angel sighed. He sounded tired. No wonder, riding around in somebody else. “I know.”  
天使叹了口气。他听起来很疲倦。难怪，总是在别人身上乘坐。"我知道。"

Adam cocked his head. “Scuse me,” he said, giving them a friendly smile. “Why are you two people?”  
亚当歪了歪头。“不好意思，”他说着，友善地笑了笑。“你们为什么是两个人？”

The woman-angel looked at him in surprise. “Uh… it’s a bit of a long story, but–”  
女天使惊讶地看着他。“嗯...这是一个有点长的故事，但是...”

Adam made a face. “It’s not right,” he said. “You should go back to being two people.”  
亚当皱了皱眉头。“这不对”，他说。“你应该回到两个人的状态。”

And as soon as he said it, it was real and there they were.  
他一说出来，就变成了现实，他们就在那里。

The angel looked different in a human shape, all tall and skinny with red hair and wearing jeans and a t-shirt with a cactus on it.  
天使以人形出现，看起来与众不同，高高瘦瘦的，红发披肩，穿着牛仔裤和一件印有仙人掌图案的T恤。

“_Angel_,” the demon said, the same way Adam’s mum sometimes spoke to his dad. It was soppy and Adam grinned when he reached out, grabbing the angel’s arm, like he couldn’t believe it was really him. The big dark billow of anger in him was gone now. He’d even forgotten about the gun.  
“天使，”恶魔说道，就像亚当的妈妈有时对他爸爸说的那样。这让亚当感到温馨，他伸手过去，抓住了天使的胳膊，好像他不敢相信这是真的。他内心中那股愤怒的黑暗已经消失了。他甚至忘记了枪。

Trouble was that while they were distracted, War had moved, swinging her flaming sword. Adam could feel the panic rising in the Them. It made sense. They were scary things made to _be_ scary by humans and the Them were all definitely human.  
问题是，当他们分心的时候，战争已经发生了变化，挥舞着她的火焰之剑。亚当能感觉到他们内心的恐慌正在上升。这是有道理的。它们是被人类制造出来的可怕事物，而他们绝对是人类。

“The thing is,” he said to his friends, “they’re not actually real. They’re just like nightmares, really.”  
“事实是，”他对朋友们说，“它们实际上并不真实。它们只是像噩梦一样而已。”

“Little boys with your toys…”  
小男孩们，带着你们的玩具..

“I’m _not_ a boy.” Pepper got all spiky and Adam almost grinned, but War ignored her.  
“我不是个男孩。”辣椒变得全身都是刺，亚当差点笑出声，但沃尔却无视了她。

“I am War,” she said. “You were made to serve me. To live in me and die in me.”  
“我是战争，”她说道。“你们被创造来为我服务。在我中生活，在我中死去。”

Pepper’s spikiness was getting even spikier than usual and that was good. She was angry and that made the scared part smaller. “My mum says war is just masculine imperialism executed on a global stage.”  
Pepper的刺痛感比平常更加刺痛，这是好事。她很生气，这让她害怕的部分变得更小了。“我妈妈说战争只是男性帝国主义在全球舞台上的执行。”

War laughed, all blood and red and nasty. “A little _girl_.” Oooh, bad idea, Adam thought. “Run home and play with your dollies, little girl.”  
战争嘲笑着，满身是血，红色而恶心。“一个小女孩。”哦，亚当心想，这主意不好。“回家去和你的洋娃娃玩吧，小女孩。”

The scared was _gone_ and Pepper was burning as much as the sword. “I do not. endorse. everyday. sexism.” She ran forward as War swung the sword and kicked her hard in the shin. War yelped and dropped the sword and Pepper snatched it, hot and angry and fierce. “We’re Adam’s _real_ friends, not you lot. You’re a joke.”  
恐惧已经消失了，而佩珀和剑一样燃烧着。“我不支持每天的性别歧视。”她向前冲去，战争挥动剑，狠狠地踢了她的脚胫。战争尖叫着，掉落了剑，佩珀抓住了它，炙热而愤怒，充满了战斗力。“我们是亚当真正的朋友，不是你们这些人。你们是个笑话。”

Wensley and Brian didn’t move, but Adam could feel their pride. That was _their_ Pepper with a real _sword_, fighting _War_. Scared was being replaced with proper Themness and that was the best thing in the world, the only thing to go against stupid nightmare monsters.  
温斯利和布莱恩没有动，但亚当能感受到他们的骄傲。那是他们的佩珀，手持真剑与战争搏斗。恐惧正在被真正的自我所取代，这是世界上最美好的事情，也是唯一能对抗愚蠢的噩梦怪物的事情。

“Just say what you believe, Pepper,” Adam said, nodding.  
“尽管说出你相信的话，佩珀，”亚当点头说道。

Pepper looked at him and she turned and stabbed out with the sword, right into War. “I believe in peace, _bitch_.”  
Pepper看着他，转身用剑刺向战争。"我相信和平，混蛋。"

Maybe they didn’t see what he saw, but Adam saw the power of War pouring into the sword. “Drop it, Pepper!” he shouted. “Quick!”  
也许他们没有看到亚当所看到的，但亚当看到了战争的力量涌入剑中。“放下它，佩珀！”他大声喊道。“快！”

The metal hit the ground, but Brian was already moving, grabbing it and charging at Pollution and, as if he understood what was going on, he struck them. “I believe in a _clean_ world!”  
金属撞击在地面上，但布莱恩已经行动起来，抓起金属并冲向污染物，仿佛他明白发生了什么，他击打了它们。“我相信一个清洁的世界！”

Pollution dissolved like the bubbling mess they were, leaving nothing behind but the crown and Wensley grabbed the sword, his hands shaking, but even then, Adam didn’t need to tell Dog. It was like they all knew exactly what they were fighting for and Adam grinned as Wensley and Dog took down Famine, the scales smashing to the ground.  
污染像一团冒泡的混乱一样消散了，除了王冠，什么都没有留下。温斯利抓住剑，手在颤抖，但亚当不需要告诉狗。就像他们都清楚自己在为何而战一样，亚当笑了起来，温斯利和狗一起击败了饥荒，天平摔落在地。

“That looks a bit like your old sword,” Adam heard the demon saying.  
亚当听到恶魔说：“那看起来有点像你的旧剑。”

“Um.” The angel sounded awkward. “Not mine. Borrowed it.”  
“嗯。”天使听起来有些尴尬。“不是我的。借来的。”

“You– oh Lord… you are _hopeless_, my dear.”  
你，哦主啊...你真是无可救药，亲爱的。

The only one left was Death, in his black cloak and hood, all skull-face and staring.  
唯一留下的只有死神，身穿黑色斗篷和兜帽，全身骷髅面孔，目光凝视。

“Death,” Adam said, “This all has to stop now.”  
“死亡，”亚当说，“这一切现在必须停止。”

Death inclined his head. “It has stopped, but they will be back. We are never far away. _I_ am creation’s shadow. You cannot destroy me. That would destroy the world. Good day, gentlemen.”  
死神微微点头。“它已经停止了，但它们会回来的。我们从未离开得太远。我是创造的阴影。你无法摧毁我，那将毁灭世界。先生们，祝你们愉快。”

“Cheek!” The old lady said, making Adam snicker, especially Pepper echoed her.  
“臭小子！”老太太说着，让亚当咯咯地笑了起来，尤其是佩珀还跟着附和。

Death spread out the biggest wings Adam had ever seen – except on a jumbo jet, but that didn’t count because they weren’t attached to people – all black and glittering like the nights when there were no clouds and the stars filled up the whole sky, and in a blink, he was gone.  
死亡展开了亚当曾见过的最大的翅膀 - 除了巨型喷气式飞机上的翅膀，但那不算，因为它们不是附着在人身上 - 全都是黑色的，闪闪发光，就像没有云的夜晚，星星填满整个天空，转眼间，他消失了。

“Did they–” Crowley reached out blindly to grab at Aziraphale’s arm. “Did they do it? Is it over?” The demon was rigid and tense, which made Crowley glance at him, worried. “Aziraphale?”  
“他们……” 克劳利伸手在空中摸索着抓住了阿齐拉费尔的胳膊。“他们做了吗？结束了吗？” 恶魔僵硬而紧张，这让克劳利担心地瞥了他一眼。“阿齐拉费尔？”

Aziraphale looked at him. “What do you think? Heaven. Hell. Do you think they’ll let this go?”  
亚齐拉费尔看着他。“你觉得呢？天堂。地狱。你觉得他们会放过这件事吗？”

Crowley’s heart sank, remembering the uniform and the soldiers lining up for battle and the words of every angel he had spoken to about stopping the coming Armageddon. “Damn it.” Still, credit had to be given where credit was due and he hurried forward. “Hoi, Antichrist. What was your name again?”  
克劳利的心沉了下去，他记起了制服和士兵们列队准备战斗的场景，还有他与每个天使交谈过的关于阻止即将到来的末日的话语。“该死。”不过，应该给予应有的赞赏，他匆忙前进。“喂，反基督者。你叫什么名字来着？”

The boy grinned at him. “Adam Young.”  
男孩冲他咧嘴一笑。“亚当·杨。”

Crowley tried his best to smile. “Good job there, getting your friends together to save the world.”  
克劳利尽力微笑着说道：“干得不错，能够召集朋友一起拯救世界。”

“Hey!” 嘿！

He swung around at the angry voice, startled to see a very hostile-looking young woman hurrying towards him, an awkward, bespectacled young man not far behind her. Oh. OH! The woman he had hit with the… oh, oh no. “Oh, shit! Book girl!”  
他被愤怒的声音吓了一跳，转过身来，惊讶地看到一个看起来非常敌对的年轻女人匆匆走向他，一个笨拙的、戴着眼镜的年轻男人紧随其后。哦。哦！他撞到的那个女人...哦，不。 "哦，该死！书呆子！"

Something whiffled past his head and the woman staggered back with a grunt as a charcoal brick of an old book hit her in the middle. He recognised the cover instantly and whipped around. “Aziraphale! What the hell did you do that for?”  
有东西在他头上呼啸而过，那位女士被一本炭黑色的旧书砸中，发出一声闷哼后踉跄后退。他立刻认出了书的封面，急忙转身。“阿齐拉费尔！你为什么这么做？”

“Fun?” The demon shrugged unrepentantly with that damned cheeky grin that made Crowley’s annoyance dissolve instantly, though the demon frowned suddenly, snatching a fluttering scrap of scorched paper out of the air.  
“好玩？”那个恶魔无悔地耸了耸肩，露出那个该死的顽皮笑容，让克劳利的烦恼瞬间消散，尽管恶魔突然皱起了眉头，从空中抓住了一张飘动的烧焦纸片。

“What’s going on out here?” Book girl demanded hoarsely.  
“这里发生了什么事？”书童沙哑地质问道。

Crowley turned back to her. “Long story.” He felt more than heard Aziraphale slink up behind him. “And–” He shot a warning look over his shoulder at the demon. “This one would talk your ear off, so please don’t ask him.”  
克劳利转身面对她。“长话短说。”他感觉到阿齐拉费尔悄悄地靠近他。“而且——”他警告性地瞥了一眼身后的恶魔。“这家伙会絮絮叨叨地说个没完，所以请不要问他。”

She eyed him warily, then glanced at the kids. “Hey Adam. Pepper. You two.”  
她警惕地盯着他，然后瞥了一眼孩子们。“嘿，亚当。佩珀。你们两个。”

Oh, that was a perfect coincidence. The owner of the Agnes Nutter book knew the Antichrist.  
哦，这真是个完美的巧合。《阿格尼丝·纳特的预言书》的主人认识那个反基督者。

Adam Young beamed. “Hi Anathema! You just stopped them blowing up the world, didn’t you?”  
亚当·杨兴高采烈地说道：“嗨，阿纳西玛！你刚刚阻止了他们炸毁世界，对吧？”

Oh. _Oh_. Anathema. Oh, right. All the details in the book and…  
哦。哦。忌讳。哦，对了。书中的所有细节和...

Crowley stared at the young man behind her. He knew that uniform. It was a cleaner, neater version of the one on a much older human standing not even ten feet away. _Oh!_ Well. Ah. That… well, that prophecy _did_ mean what it seemed to mean then.  
克劳利盯着她身后的年轻人。他认识那套制服。它是一位年长的人身上穿着的那套制服的更整洁、更干净的版本。哦！好吧。啊。那个……嗯，那个预言果然是意味着它看起来的意思。

“I guess,” Book-girl said, taking the specky guy’s hand. “My boyfriend here did the tricky bit.”  
“我猜，”书呆子说着，握住了那个戴眼镜的男生的手。“我男朋友在这里完成了棘手的部分。”

Well, well, well, Crowley thought, the grin sneaking back onto his face. Free will, still alive and kicking six millennia on.  
哦，哦，哦，克劳利想着，笑容再次浮现在他的脸上。自由意志，六千年后仍然活跃着。

A flare of lightning from behind him made Crowley whip around, his heart sinking at the sight of not just the Archangel Gabriel standing – grim-faced and glaring – on the charred tarmac, but the ground roiling underfoot as one of the Lords of Hell emerged from below.  
一道闪电从他身后突然闪过，克劳利猛地转身，心情沉重地看到不仅仅是大天使加百列站在焦黑的柏油路上，面容严峻，目光凶狠，而且地面在他脚下翻腾，一位地狱之主从地下浮现出来。

“Well, my dear,” Aziraphale murmured, his elbow brushing Crowley’s. “This is a… pleasant surprise, isn’t it?”  
“嗯，亲爱的，”亚齐拉费尔轻声说道，他的手肘轻轻碰到了克劳利的手臂。“这可真是个…令人愉快的惊喜，不是吗？”

Crowley smiled tightly, fingers twitching by his sides. “Mm.”  
克劳利勉强地微笑着，手指在身旁不停地抽动着。“嗯。”

The demon moved a step ahead, sweeping into an extravagant bow. “Lord Beelzebub,” he said, his voice a little more respectful than he usually managed.  
恶魔向前迈了一步，优雅地鞠躬。他说：“比利时魔王大人”，声音比平时更加尊敬。

“Aziraphale,” the demon Lord said, baring their teeth. “The traitor.”  
“阿齐拉费尔，”恶魔领主咬牙切齿地说道，“叛徒。”

Oh Lord, Crowley groaned inwardly. What on earth had Aziraphale done in the ten hours he’d been left unsupervised?  
哦，上帝啊，克劳利内心叹息。阿齐拉费尔独自被留了十个小时，到底做了什么？

“That’s hardly very nice, my dear,” Aziraphale said with his customary pout.  
“亲爱的，这可不太好听啊。”亚齐拉费尔带着他惯常的噘嘴说道。

“Oh, I’m just getting started,” Beelzebub snapped. “Where’zzzzz the boy?”  
“哦，我才刚刚开始呢，”贝尔撒巴尔咬牙切齿地说道。“小子在哪里？”

Aziraphale straightened up, looking towards the Young boy.  
亚齐拉费尔挺直了身子，朝着那个年轻男孩望去。

“That one,” Gabriel said, smiling that infuriating smile of his, and bending down to talk to the boy. “Adam Young.” Crowley’s palms ached, fingers digging into them. It was so tempting to put himself between the angel and the kid, but something in the kid’s expression, the utter disdain made him think he really didn’t have to. Gabriel, however, clearly didn’t notice. “Young man, Armageddon must… restart right now. Temporary inconvenience cannot get in the way of the greater good.”  
“就是他。”加百列笑着说道，露出了他那令人恼火的笑容，弯下腰与男孩交谈。“亚当·杨。”克劳利的手掌疼痛，手指深深地插入其中。他很想站在天使和孩子之间，但是孩子脸上的鄙视表情让他觉得自己真的不需要这样做。然而，加百列显然没有注意到。“年轻人，末日必须……立即重新开始。暂时的不便不能妨碍更大的利益。”

“As to what it stands in the way of,” Beelzebub cut over him coldly, “that is yet to be decided, but the battle must be decided now, boy. That is your destiny. It is written. Now start the war.”  
“至于它阻碍的是什么，”贝尔则布冷冷地打断他，“那还有待决定，但战斗必须现在决定，孩子。这是你的命运。它已经写下了。现在开始战争吧。”

Aziraphale made a low, angry sound, but Crowley reached out blindly, touching his arm. Oh, there was something going on behind the Antichrist’s eyes and he knew that look. He’d seen it in the mirror often enough.  
亚齐拉费尔发出了一声低沉而愤怒的声音，但克劳利伸出手盲目地触摸了他的胳膊。哦，那个敌基督眼中有什么事情正在发生，他知道那种表情。他经常在镜子里看到过。

“You both want to end the world just to see whose gang is best,” the Antichrist said, as if it was the stupidest thing in the world.  
“你们两个都想毁灭世界，只是为了看看谁的帮派更厉害。”那个反基督者说，仿佛这是世界上最愚蠢的事情。

“Obviously,” Gabriel sputtered. Didn’t like kids, did he, Crowley thought, smiling grimly. Didn’t know what to do with them or how to talk to them. _Good._ “It’s the great plan. It’s the entire reason for the creation of the earth.”  
“显然，”加百利咕哝着说。克劳利心想，他不喜欢孩子，是吧，他冷笑着。不知道如何对待他们或者如何与他们交流。很好。“这就是伟大的计划。这是创造地球的全部原因。”

“I’ve got this,” Beelzebub interrupted again and oh, it was worth being here just to see Gabriel twitching in frustration. And oh, even better, like Gabriel, she bent to talk to the boy. Crowley had been around enough kids, big and small, to know that was going the right way to make them do exactly the opposite of what you wanted them to do. “Adam, when this is all over, you’re going to get to rule the world. Don’t you want to rule the world?”  
“我来处理这个问题。”贝利泽布再次打断，哦，值得来这里就是为了看到加百列因为沮丧而痉挛。而且，更好的是，就像加百列一样，她弯下腰和男孩交谈。克劳利已经接触过足够多的孩子，无论是大的还是小的，他知道这是让他们做与你想要的完全相反的事情的正确方法。“亚当，当这一切结束时，你将能够统治世界。你不想统治世界吗？”

Adam made a face. “It’s hard enough to think of things for Pepper and Wensley and Brian to do all the time so they don’t get bored.” He gave them a little smile. “I’ve got all the world I want.”  
亚当皱了皱眉头。“已经很难想出让佩珀、温斯利和布莱恩一直有事可做，免得他们觉得无聊。”他微笑着对他们说：“我已经拥有了我想要的整个世界。”

“You can’t just refuse to be who you are!” Gabriel exclaimed.  
“你不能拒绝做自己！”加布里埃尔大声说道。

Crowley couldn’t help shooting a glance at Aziraphale, a rush of warmth running through him when he felt the demon’s fingers close around his and squeeze. Wanna bet, he thought.  
克劳利忍不住瞥了一眼阿齐拉费尔，当他感受到恶魔的手指紧紧握住自己的手并用力一捏时，一股温暖涌上心头。想打赌吗，他心想。

“Your birth! Your destiny! They’re part of the Great Plan!”  
你的出生！你的命运！它们都是伟大计划的一部分！

The Great Plan. 伟大的计划。

Crowley wanted to scream bollocks to the plan. God, he and Aziraphale had taken it apart, shaken it, turned it inside our and upside down and backwards and it was as ineff…  
克劳利想要对这个计划大喊胡说八道。天啊，他和阿齐拉费尔已经把它拆解开来，摇晃它，把它翻个底朝天，上下颠倒，但它还是一团糟…

Ohhh. 哦。

OH! 哦！

“Quick question!” He pulled his hand from Aziraphale’s to stride over to the Antichrist.  
"快问一下！" 他从阿齐拉费尔的手中抽出来，大步走向那个反基督。

“Oh, Lord,” Gabriel groaned. “This is _not_ the time for your questions, Ra–”  
“哦，主啊，”加百列叹息道。“现在不是你问问题的时候，拉——”

“I think it might be.” Crowley snapped, holding up a hand and cutting him off. “Here’s the thing. Great Plan. Or Ineffable Plan. Which one are we doing right now?”  
“我觉得可能是这样。”克劳利打断他，举起手示意停下。“事情是这样的。伟大计划。或者说不可言喻的计划。我们现在是在做哪一个？”

Beelzebub turned on him, eyes blazing. “The Great Plan! It is written there shall be a world and it shall last for six thousand years and end in fire and flame.”  
贝尔塞巴布转过身来，眼睛冒着火焰。“伟大的计划！书上写着将会有一个世界，它将持续六千年，并以火焰的形式终结。”

“Well, yeah,” Crowley said, nodding ponderously. “Sounds like the Great Plan, all right. All there in the books and what have you.” He smiled at them. “But just to double-check, is that the Ineffable Plan as well?”  
“嗯，是的，”克劳利沉重地点了点头。“听起来像是伟大的计划没错。书上都有详细记载。”他微笑着看着他们。“但只是为了再次确认，这也是那个无法言喻的计划吗？”

Gabriel’s perfect face twisted up in confusion. “There’s the same thing!”  
加布里埃尔完美的脸上露出困惑的表情。“是同样的东西！”

Crowley’s smile turned into a grin and it only widened as Aziraphale prowled around beside him, murmuring in passing, “They have no idea, do they?” He slanted a look at the demon, jerking his chin.  
克劳利的微笑变成了一丝狞笑，而当阿齐拉费尔在他身旁悄悄走动时，他的笑容只是变得更加宽广。阿齐拉费尔边走边低声说道：“他们一点都不知道，对吧？”他斜眼看了看那个恶魔，点了点下巴。

“He does make a good point,” Aziraphale said, taking up a position on Adam’s other side. “It would be awfully embarrassing for everyone if you thought you knew what the Great Plan said, but were actually going against God’s Ineffable Plan.”  
“他说得很有道理。”亚齐拉费尔说着，站到亚当的另一侧。“如果你以为自己知道伟大计划的内容，却实际上违背了上帝的难以言喻的计划，那将会让每个人都感到尴尬。”

“Everyone knows the Great Plan,” Crowley added cheerfully. “I mean, you said it yourselves. It’s written, isn’t it?”  
“每个人都知道伟大的计划，”克劳利愉快地补充道。“我的意思是，你们自己说过。它都写在那里了，不是吗？”

“Which stands to reason,” Aziraphale took over smoothly, “that it can’t possibly be the Ineffable Plan. I mean, if it _was_ written, then it wouldn’t be… well… Ineffable, would it?”  
“这是合理的推论，”阿齐拉费尔顺势接过话头，“所以它绝对不可能是那个难以言喻的计划。我的意思是，如果它被写下来，那它就不会是……嗯……难以言喻了，对吧？”

Crowley had to stifle a laugh at their expressions. Lord, even if the world _did_ end, it would almost be worth it to bask in the blinding confusion on the faces of the Archangel and the Lord of Hell. Crowley gave Adam’s shoulder an encouraging squeeze, keeping his eyes fixed on them.  
克劳利不得不忍住笑声，看着大天使和地狱之主脸上的困惑表情，他觉得即使世界末日真的来临，也几乎值得一试，只为了享受他们脸上那种令人眩晕的困惑。克劳利鼓励地拍了拍亚当的肩膀，目不转睛地盯着他们。

“But it izzzzz written,” Beelzebub said uncertainly.  
“但它确实写着，”贝利泽布说得不确定。

“God,” Gabriel said defensively, “does not play games with the universe.”  
“上帝不会与宇宙玩游戏。”加百列辩解道。

Crowley wasn’t sure whether he or Aziraphale snorted more loudly.  
克劳利不确定是他还是阿齐拉费尔更大声地哼笑。

“So innocent, isn’t he?” Crowley said, glancing over at the demon. “I almost miss those days.”  
“他多么天真无邪，不是吗？”克劳利说着，瞥了一眼那个恶魔。“我几乎怀念那些日子了。”

Gabriel and Beelzebub exchanged wary glances, then sidled away, muttering together. There was a lot of emphatic gesturing, both upwards and downwards, and neither of them looked very happy about the developments.  
加百列和贝利泽布相互投以警惕的眼神，然后悄悄地离开，一起低声咕哝着。他们进行了许多有力的手势，向上和向下都有，两人对这一进展都不太满意。

“Do you think,” Aziraphale murmured, “that their heads might explode?”  
“你觉得，”亚齐拉费尔低声说道，“他们的脑袋会不会爆炸？”

Crowley grinned at him, recalling something one of the kids at the community centre had said to him once. “They’ve hurt themselves in their confusion.”  
克劳利冲他咧嘴一笑，回想起社区中心的一个孩子曾经对他说过的话。“他们在困惑中伤害了自己。”

Both Archangel and Lord of Hell looked over as if they had heard him.  
天使长和地狱之主都转过头来，仿佛听到了他的话一样。

“Well,” Gabriel said darkly, “at least we know who’s to blame!”  
“嗯，”加布里埃尔阴沉地说道，“至少我们知道该怪谁了！”

Crowley’s grin widened and he gave them a cheerful wave.  
克劳利的笑容变得更加灿烂，他向他们友好地挥手。

Gabriel stalked closer and glowered down at the boy between them. “Young man,” he said, “You were put on this earth for one reason and one reason only: to end it. You’re a disobedient little brat and I hope someone tells your father.”  
加布里埃尔走近，怒视着他们之间的男孩。“年轻人，”他说，“你来到这个世界上只有一个原因：毁灭它。你是个不听话的小坏蛋，我希望有人告诉你父亲。”

“Oh, they will,” Beelzebub said. “And your father will not be pleased.”  
“哦，他们会的，”贝利泽布说道。“而且你父亲会不高兴的。”

Crowley glanced sidelong at Aziraphale, relieved to see he wasn’t the only one feeling a bit worried.  
克劳利斜眼瞥了一眼阿齐拉费尔，松了口气，看到他也有些担心。

“But–” he began. "但是——" 他开始说。

Gabriel held up a finger. “Not a word,” he snapped. “This is the last time we’ll accept your… insubordination, Raziel.”  
加百列举起一根手指。“一言不发，”他厉声说道。“这是我们最后一次容忍你的……不服从，拉齐尔。”

He and Beelzebub both vanished in a blink and Crowley groaned, dropping his face into his hand.  
他和贝利亚尔都在眨眼间消失了，克劳利闷哼一声，把脸埋在手中。

Two feet to his left, he heard Aziraphale’s strangled voice. “_Raziel_?!?”  
他的左边两步远，他听到了阿齐拉费尔勉强的声音。“拉齐尔？！？”

Well, he thought, _shit._ 嗯，他想，糟糕。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

“Raziel.” "拉齐尔。"

Crowley winced. “Look, I know I didn’t–”  
克劳利皱了皱眉。“听着，我知道我没有……”

“You,” Aziraphale jabbed a finger towards him accusingly, “are Raziel?!”  
“你，”亚齐拉费尔指着他，指责地说道，“就是拉齐尔？！”

The Antichrist was staring. Everyone was staring and Crowley clenched and unclenched his hands spasmodically. “Aziraphale, we really can’t–”  
反基督者盯着。每个人都盯着，克劳利痉挛地握紧和松开双手。“亚齐拉费尔，我们真的不能——”

“RAZIEL!?!” "RAZIEL!?!"

“Yes, but–” 是的，但是--

“But? _But_?!?!” The demon’s face was flushed with indignation. “How long have we known each other and you never bothered to _tell_ me?”  
"但是？但是？！" 那个恶魔满脸愤怒地红了起来。"我们认识多久了，你居然从来没有告诉过我？"

“’Ziraphale!” Crowley gestured desperately around them. “We– this is– later! We can talk about this later!”  
“亲爱的齐拉费尔！”克劳利绝望地向周围挥手。“我们——这个——以后再说！我们可以晚点讨论这个！”

“Fuck!” Aziraphale folded as if he had been punched in the chest, doubling over.  
“靠！”亚齐拉费尔像是被人一拳击中胸口一样，痛苦地弯下腰。

“Aziraphale!” “亚齐拉费尔！”

The demon stared up at him. “_What_ later?” He sounded both devastated and furious. “_He_ knows. _He_ is coming!” He laughed bitterly. “Oh well. Fitting the last thing I ever find out from you is that everything was a lie.”  
恶魔凝视着他。“之后呢？”他的声音既沮丧又愤怒。“他知道了。他要来了！”他苦笑着。“哦，好吧。最后我从你这里得知的一切都是谎言，真是合适。”

Crowley flinched as if the demon had hit him. “No. We can’t– this _can’t_ be where it ends!”  
克劳利像是被恶魔击中一样退缩了一下。“不行。我们不能——这不能就是终点！”

“Oh no?” Aziraphale’s laughter was sharp and agonised. “You going to tell Satan that?” he stared around wildly at the humans. “That’s right, kiddies. Satan is coming and we’re all going to Hell in a hatbasket!” He looked back at Crowley, the grief and betrayal in his eyes like a hammer blow. “You _bastard_.”  
“哦不？”阿齐拉费尔的笑声尖锐而痛苦。“你打算告诉撒旦吗？”他疯狂地环顾四周的人类。“没错，孩子们。撒旦要来了，我们都要下地狱了！”他回头看着克劳利，眼中充满了悲伤和背叛，就像一记重锤。“你这个混蛋。”

Crowley’s world narrowed to Aziraphale’s face, the hurt, the shock, the grief more unbearable than anything else. Oh, he had underestimated him. He had underestimated both of them. “No,” he growled. This world was his. This demon was _his_. “No, this _won’t_ be how it ends.”  
克劳利的世界只剩下了阿齐拉费尔的脸，那伤痛、震惊和悲伤比任何事情都难以忍受。哦，他低估了他。他低估了他们两个。"不，"他咆哮道。这个世界是他的。这个恶魔是他的。"不，它不会以这种方式结束。"

Aziraphale rocked back on his heels, laughing derisively. “So do something! Raziel of the Book! All wise, all knowing. _Do something_.”  
亚齐拉费尔嘲笑地后退了一步，笑着说道：“那你就做点什么吧！书中的拉齐尔！全智全能的存在。做点什么吧。”

“Never,” Crowley snarled, reaching out into the ancient powers and the magics that he had drawn on in the very foundations of the universe. “Call me that name.”  
“绝不！”克劳利咆哮着，伸手触及他在宇宙的根基中汲取的古老力量和魔法。“别再叫我那个名字。”

The demon stared at him and his face crumpled. “Crowley...” He sagged, defeated, and it was more crushing than the dismissal and derision of Heaven for six millennia.  
恶魔盯着他，脸上露出了痛苦的表情。“克劳利……”他颓然低下头，这比天堂对他六千年的驳斥和嘲笑更加沉重。

Crowley closed his eyes, reaching as hard as he could with all the strength he had left. Damn you all, he swore in his heart of hearts. Damn you all for doing this to us. Doing this to them. Doing this to _him_. And you… Morningstar… fuck you.  
克劳利闭上眼睛，尽全力用剩下的力量去努力。该死的，他在内心深处发誓。该死的，你们所有人都为了我们而这样做。为了他们而这样做。为了他而这样做。还有你...晨星...去你的。

And he _pulled_ with all he had left.  
他用尽全力拼尽最后一丝力气。

The rumble of the earth, the thunder in the skies, the crackle and hiss of power fell silent.  
大地的隆隆声，天空中的雷鸣声，电力的噼啪声和嘶嘶声都安静下来了。

A warm soft breeze fluttered against his wings and Crowley staggered, catching a shaking breath as he opened his eyes.  
一股温暖而柔软的微风拂过他的翅膀，克劳利摇摇晃晃地站起来，睁开眼睛，喘着气。

Pale sands unfolded around them.  
他们周围展开了一片苍白的沙滩。

Them. 他们。

He was there. Aziraphale too. Both of them with their wings out, though Aziraphale was looking at him with a wondering, dazed expression. He almost smiled. _Didn’t know I could do that, did you_?  
他在那里。阿齐拉费尔也在。他们两个都展开了翅膀，尽管阿齐拉费尔用一种惊讶而恍惚的表情看着他。他几乎笑了。你不知道我能做到这个，对吧？

And… the Antichrist. 还有...反基督。

Right, right. Okay. A little time. They had a little time and the boy who was the centre of it all.  
好的，好的。好的。有一点时间。他们有一点时间，还有那个成为焦点的男孩。

“Adam, listen,” he said gently, urgently. “Your father is coming to destroy you, probably to destroy all of us.”  
“亚当，听着，”他温和而急切地说道。“你父亲要来毁灭你，可能也要毁灭我们所有人。”

“My dad?” The boy half-laughed. “My dad wouldn’t hurt anyone.”  
“我爸爸？”男孩半笑着说道。“我爸爸不会伤害任何人。”

Crowley shook his head. “Not your earthly father,” he said. “Satan. Your father who is no longer in Heaven. He is coming and he is _angry_.”  
克劳利摇了摇头。“不是你在人间的父亲，”他说。“撒旦。你那不再在天堂的父亲。他即将降临，而且愤怒。”

Adam looked as lost as Crowley felt. “So what do you want me to do about it? Fight him?”  
亚当看起来像克劳利一样迷茫。“那你希望我怎么办？和他打架吗？”

Crowley hesitated, then shook his head. It would begin the cycle of violence all over again. Fighting Lucifer was what had started everything. “I don’t think fighting him would do any good. We’re gonna have to come up with something else.”  
克劳利犹豫了一下，然后摇了摇头。这将重新引发暴力循环。与路西法的战斗是一切的起因。“我觉得与他战斗不会有任何好处。我们得想出其他办法。”

Adam’s fear was tangible. “But I’m just a kid.”  
亚当的恐惧感触可见。“可我只是个孩子。”

Crowley wished he could give the boy a reassuring hug, but the effort of holding the world around them together, holding everything so still was taking far more out of him than he wanted to admit.  
克劳利希望他能给那个男孩一个安慰的拥抱，但是维持他们周围世界的稳定，保持一切静止的努力消耗了他更多的力量，这比他愿意承认的要多得多。

“That’s not a bad thing to be, Adam.” Aziraphale’s voice was like a rush of cool water over hot flames and Crowley looked at him with grateful relief as the demon got back to his feet. Aziraphale was smiling again, that familiar, warm, knowing smile of someone who is well and truly about to fuck someone’s shit up. “You know, I was scared that you would be Hell incarnate. I had hoped we could prevent that.”  
“亚当，成为那样的人并不是件坏事。”亚齐拉费尔的声音如同一股凉水冲过炽热的火焰，克劳利感激地看着他，恶魔重新站起身来。亚齐拉费尔再次露出了微笑，那种熟悉、温暖、深谙如何搞砸某人的表情。“你知道吗，我曾经担心你会成为地狱的化身。我曾希望我们能够阻止这一切。”

“And I used to think I wanted you to be Heaven incarnate,” Crowley admitted with a tentative smile at both demon and Antichrist.  
“而我曾经以为我希望你成为天堂的化身，”克劳利带着腼腆的微笑向恶魔和反基督者承认道。

Aziraphale’s eyes gleamed. “You’re _Human_ incarnate and that’s something so much _better_.” He looked over at Crowley and his smile softened into something almost, possibly, maybe like forgiveness.  
亚齐拉费尔的眼睛闪烁着光芒。“你是人类的化身，这是一件更加美好的事情。”他看向克劳利，微笑变得柔和，几乎，可能，或许有些像是宽恕。

It was like a weight across Crowley’s shoulders evaporated.  
就像一块压在克劳利肩膀上的重物消失了一样。

Right. Think. Think, think, think.  
对。思考。思考，思考，思考。

Antichrist. Powers over reality, at least for now. Still powerful, but how…  
反基督。对现实的掌控力量，至少目前如此。依然强大，但是如何……

Oh. How… divine. 哦，多么……神圣。

“Adam, listen,” he said urgently, moving closer to the boy. “Reality will listen to you right now. You’ve done it before. You can do it again. You can _change_ things.”  
“亚当，听着，”他紧急地说道，靠近男孩。“现实会听你的。你以前做到过。你可以再次做到。你可以改变事情。”

“And whatever happens,” Aziraphale stepped alongside the boy, offering the child his hand, “for good or for evil, we’ll be beside you.”  
“无论发生什么事情，”亚齐拉费尔走到男孩身旁，伸出手给了孩子，“无论是善是恶，我们都会在你身边。”

We. 我们。

Fuck yes. 是的，太棒了。

He offered Adam his own hand. “I’m going to restart time,” he said, squeezing the boy’s trembling fingers. “You won’t have much time to do whatever it is you’re going to do…” The world shuddered around them and blazing brightness gave way to the thunderous dark of the airfield. “Do it quickly!”  
他伸出自己的手给亚当。"我要重新启动时间，"他说着，握住了那个颤抖的男孩的手指。"你没有太多时间去做你要做的事情..."世界在他们周围颤抖，耀眼的光明被空旷的机场的阴暗所取代。"快点做吧！"

Before them, the earth surged and roiled as Satan broke through the ground. Crowley lunged down, snatching up the old sword, wincing as it flamed to life in his hands. The boy needed back-up and if he had to–  
在他们面前，地球翻腾不已，撒旦从地底冲出。克劳利向下扑去，抓起那把古老的剑，感到手中的剑燃起火焰时畏缩了一下。这个男孩需要支援，即使他不得不——

“My dear,” Aziraphale stepped closer to him. “You don’t know what you’re doing with that old thing.” He snatched the sword from Crowley’s hands, taking up a defensive stance. “Let me.”  
“亲爱的，”亚齐拉费尔走近他。“你不知道你在拿那把旧东西干什么。”他从克劳利手中夺过剑，摆出防御姿势。“让我来吧。”

“Aziraphale…” Crowley’s mouth went dry.  
“亚齐拉费尔……” 克劳利的嘴巴变得干燥起来。

“Oh, do shut up, darling,” Aziraphale purred, despite the way his hands and face were crisping from the holy flame. “Our boy is working.”  
“哦，亲爱的，闭嘴吧，”阿齐拉费尔低声说道，尽管他的手和脸正在被神圣的火焰烧焦。“我们的孩子在工作。”

Crowley stared out over the airfield as Adam marched determinedly towards the towering figure of Satan.  
克劳利凝视着机场，亚当坚定地走向撒旦那庞大的身影。

“You’re not my dad! Dads don’t wait until you’re eleven to say hello and then turn up to tell you off!”  
你不是我爸爸！爸爸不会等到你十一岁才跟你打招呼，然后出现来责备你！

Oh, oh, that was… so simple, so simple and so perfect.  
哦，哦，那太简单了，太简单而又完美。

Lucifer, it seemed, didn’t know what to do with it, his roars shaking the earth.  
看起来，路西法似乎不知道该怎么处理这个问题，他的咆哮震撼着大地。

“If I’m in trouble with my dad,” Adam yelled, “then it won’t be you! It’s gonna be the dad who was there! You’re not my dad!”  
“如果我和我爸爸闹矛盾，”亚当大声喊道，“那不会是你的错！是那个一直在的爸爸的错！你不是我的爸爸！”

“What did you say?” Lucifer snarled.  
“你说什么？”路西法咆哮道。

“You can do it!” Crowley shouted, exultant. The boy’s belief and knowledge that he was right was glowing like a flame, brighter and brighter.  
“你能做到！”克劳利兴奋地喊道。男孩坚信自己是正确的，这种信念和知识像火焰一样闪耀，越来越亮。

“Say it again, Adam!” Aziraphale’s voice rose over the deafening roars of Lucifer’s fury.  
“再说一遍，亚当！”阿齐拉费尔的声音在鲁西弗的愤怒咆哮声中响起。

“You’re not my dad!” Adam’s self-assurance blazed like a star. Brighter than a star. “You never were!”  
"你不是我爸爸！" 亚当的自信如同一颗熊熊燃烧的星星，比星星还要明亮。"你从来都不是！"

And – Crowley laughed in relief and delight – as Adam’s belief made it so.  
而且——克劳利如释重负地笑了起来——正如亚当的信念所成就的那样。

Children had been dispatched back to their parents. Witches and witchfinders had drifted off in pairs. And so, Aziraphale thought, gazing down at his hands, the world was saved. He curled his fingers, the singed skin cracking, but it would heal.  
孩子们已经被送回了他们的父母身边。女巫和巫师猎人们成双成对地离开了。于是，亚齐拉费尔想着，低头看着自己的双手，世界得救了。他弯曲了手指，烧焦的皮肤裂开了，但它会愈合。

A bottle nudged against his elbow.  
一瓶子碰到了他的肘部。

He glanced at it, then at the angel who had just down beside him on the bench.  
他瞥了一眼，然后看向刚刚坐在他旁边的天使。

“Olive branch?” Crowley said quietly.  
“橄榄枝？”克劳利轻声说道。

Aziraphale took it, twisting the cork out with a flicker of a miracle. He took a mouthful – a fine claret – then offered it back to Crowley.  
亚齐拉费尔接过酒瓶，用一丝奇迹的闪烁扭开了瓶塞。他喝了一口，一款上好的红葡萄酒，然后递给了克劳利。

“All over, then,” he murmured.  
“到此为止了。”他低声说道。

Crowley nodded. “Seems so.” He drank, then sighed, setting the bottle down on the box between them. They’d gathered up the weapons of the Horsemen, packaged them all up nicely. The angel was quiet for a few minutes, then said, “Y’know I _really_ hate improvising this kind of stuff. It’s bloody exhausting.”  
克劳利点了点头。“看起来是这样。”他喝了一口，然后叹了口气，把瓶子放在他们之间的盒子上。他们收集了四骑士的武器，把它们都整理得很好。天使安静了几分钟，然后说：“你知道吗，我真的讨厌临时凑合这种事情。真是累人啊。”

“What? Saving the world?”  
“什么？拯救世界？”

“Mm.” “嗯。”

Aziraphale nodded. There were questions that needed to be asked. Satan’s sake, turned out everything he thought he knew about Crowley wasn’t that at all. Well, not everything. Not technically. He knew his favourite wines, the only foods he would willingly eat, how many records he had tucked away in his collection, the gentle sentimentality…  
亚齐拉费尔点了点头。有些问题需要问。撒旦的缘故，结果他所认为了解克劳利的一切都不是那样的。嗯，不是全部。从技术上讲，他知道他最喜欢的葡萄酒，他唯一愿意吃的食物，他收藏的唱片数量，那种温柔的情感…

When it came down to it, what didn’t he know? Just his name, really. And maybe how powerful Crowley could be, but then he was one of the angels in the Garden, wasn’t he? Should’ve guessed that much if he’d given it any thought.  
说到底，他不知道什么呢？只是他的名字，真的。也许还不知道克劳利有多强大，但他毕竟是花园里的天使之一，不是吗？如果他稍微思考一下，应该能猜到这一点。

“I’ll miss your backside,” he said, purely to break the silence.  
“我会想念你的背影。”他纯粹是为了打破沉默而说的。

Crowley coughed, choking on his mouthful of wine. “You _what_?”  
克劳利咳嗽了一声，噎住了满口的酒。“你说什么？”

“Yours. Marjorie’s.” Aziraphale smiled crookedly at him, scorched cheek stretching. “It was quite nice. Firm. Round.”  
“你的。玛乔丽的。”亚齐拉费尔笑着向他扭曲的嘴角，烧焦的脸颊拉伸着。“它相当不错。坚实。圆润。”

Crowley stared at him, then dissolved into helpless tired laughter. “Back to your old self, I see.”  
克劳利盯着他看，然后不由自主地笑出了声。"看来你又回到了以前的样子。"

“Trying,” Aziraphale admitted, glancing up as a delivery drove by them and parked a little further down the lane. “Ah… looks like we’re about to be relieved of our burden.”  
“嗯，是的。”亚齐拉费尔承认道，他抬头看着一辆快递车经过他们，然后停在巷子稍远的地方。“啊...看起来我们即将解脱了。”

Crowley looked down at the box. “Technically, I should probably get that sword back to Leliel.”  
克劳利低头看着盒子。“从技术上讲，我应该把那把剑还给莱利尔。”

“Leliel?” “Leliel？”

“Cherub. On the wall.” Crowley took another swig of the wine. “Pompous arsehole. Told him he should chase the demon out. Told me to do it myself.”  
小天使。在墙上。克劳利又喝了一口酒。“自大的混蛋。告诉他应该把恶魔赶走。他告诉我自己去做。”

“And you gave his sword away…” Aziraphale shook his head with a chuckle. “You are incorrigible.”  
“而你把他的剑送走了…”亚齐拉费尔笑着摇了摇头。“你真是无可救药。”

Crowley ducked his head with a smaller smile. “S’how I met you, though.”  
克劳利低下头，微笑更加温和。“不过，那就是我遇见你的方式。”

“I suppose so.” Aziraphale picked up the box. “Last chance to return it.”  
“我想是吧。”亚齐拉费尔拿起盒子。“最后一次机会退回去。”

Crowley gave the box a long and thoughtful look, then said with utter resolve, “Stuff them.”  
克劳利长时间而深思熟虑地盯着盒子，然后坚定地说道：“把它们塞进去。”

Lord, he was such precious when he was being defiant. No wonder Heaven had always treated him so vilely, if he had been like that since the beginning.  
主啊，他在挑衅时真是可爱极了。难怪天堂一直如此恶待他，如果他从一开始就是这样的话。

He handed the parcel on to the delivery man, a charming little fellow, and signed the necessary paperwork, watching as he returned to the van.  
他把包裹交给了一个迷人的小伙子送货员，并签署了必要的文件，看着他回到货车上。

“I can’t help thinking we ought to have destroyed them all,” he admitted.  
他承认：“我忍不住想，我们应该把它们全部摧毁。”

“Can’t,” Crowley said, his head rolling back on the back of the bench. “Couldn’t. Symbols, really. You can’t destroy something that is built so much into the heart and soul of humans.”  
“不行。”克劳利说道，他的头向后仰靠在长凳上。“不可能。符号，真的。你无法摧毁那些深深扎根于人类心灵和灵魂中的东西。”

Aziraphale nodded pensively. He fished into his pocket, withdrawing a small scrap of paper. The Nutter book had all but burned up, which ought to have devastated him, but with everything that had happened, a single book had seemed such a small thing in the great scheme. Still, when he had tossed it to – no, more accurately – at the young witch, this little scrap of nothing had fallen into his hands.  
亚齐拉费尔若有所思地点了点头。他伸手进口袋，取出一小片纸屑。纳特的书几乎烧光了，这本应该让他心碎的事情，但在经历了一切之后，一本书在伟大的计划中似乎微不足道。然而，当他把它扔给——不，更准确地说——朝着年轻女巫扔去时，这个微不足道的小纸片却落到了他手中。

“Wassat?” Crowley asked. The poor boy did sound ineffably exhausted and no small wonder, given all the dashing around he’d been doing all day.  
“咋了？”克劳利问道。可怜的孩子听起来确实筋疲力尽，也难怪，考虑到他整天忙忙碌碌的奔波。

“From Agnes Nutter’s book,” Aziraphale murmured, holding it out to him. “Which – and I am very cross about this – I didn’t know you had.”  
“这是阿格尼丝·纳特的书，”亚齐拉费尔低声说着，将书递给他。“而且——我对此非常生气——我不知道你有这本书。”

Crowley took it from him, tilting it towards the street light. “Choose your faces wisely,” he read aloud, “for soon enough you shall be playing with fire.” He wrinkled his nose. “Yeah. You’re lucky you didn’t get your hands on it. Bloody annoying game of riddles.”  
克劳利从他手中接过，将它倾斜向路灯。“明智地选择你的面孔吧，”他大声朗读，“因为很快你将与火玩耍。”他皱了皱鼻子。“是啊，你很幸运没有得到它。这个烦人的谜语游戏。”

“Where did _you_ get it?”  
你从哪里弄来的？

Crowley laughed tiredly and handed both scrap and bottle back to him. “The woman you threw it at.”  
克劳利疲倦地笑了笑，把碎片和瓶子都递还给他。“你扔给她的那个女人。”

“Book girl,” Aziraphale recalled. “The witch?”  
“书中女孩，”亚齐拉费尔回忆道。“那个女巫？”

“Mm.” Crowley ran his hand over his face. “God, I’m knackered.” He groaned. “And there’s that gig at the centre tonight.”  
“嗯。”克劳利用手掌擦了擦脸。“天啊，我累坏了。”他抱怨道。“今晚还有那个中心的演出。”

The centre. 中心。

Oh Lord… 哦，主啊…

“Crowley… the centre…” Aziraphale reached out and squeezed the angel’s wrist gently. “It burned down. Remember?”  
“克劳利……中心……”亚齐拉费尔伸出手轻轻地握住天使的手腕。“它被烧毁了。记得吗？”

A dozen emotions passed over Crowley’s face. “Oh. Shit. Yes.” He rubbed at his forehead. “Right. Yeah. Of course.” He shook his head. “Forgot.”  
克劳利的脸上闪过了十几种情绪。“哦，该死。是的。”他揉了揉额头。“对，是的。当然。”他摇了摇头。“忘了。”

It was stupid to offer, when he had always refused before, and Aziraphale had always understood why. But how could he not, when his angel was homeless. “You could always come back to the book shop?” he offered tentatively. “I– you know you’re _always_ welcome.”  
他以前一直拒绝，所以这次主动提出真是愚蠢，而且亚齐拉费尔一直都明白为什么。但是，当他的天使无家可归时，他又怎么能不这样做呢？“你可以回到书店来，随时欢迎你。”他试探性地提议道。“我——你知道，你随时都受欢迎。”

Crowley looked at him. “Even– But I–” His voiced hitched unbearably. “Aziraphale, I _lied_ to you. You should _hate_ me.”  
克劳利看着他。“甚至- 但是我-”他的声音突然停顿了下来。“亚齐拉费尔，我对你撒了谎。你应该恨我。”

Aziraphale’s heart felt like it had been squeezed in a brutal fist. “Oh, _darling_…” He tried to gather the words, find what he needed to say. “You– it’s a name. You gave me _your_ name. You– I know you. I– you’re welcome. Whatever your name is or was or will be.”  
亚齐拉费尔的心感觉像是被一只残忍的拳头紧紧握住。“哦，亲爱的……”他试图凑齐话语，找到他需要说的话。“你——这是一个名字。你给了我你的名字。我——我认识你。我——欢迎你。无论你的名字是什么，曾经是什么，或将来会是什么。”

The angel’s eyes grew bright and he looked down, blinking hard. He nodded and sniffed hard. “Okay.”  
天使的眼睛亮了起来，他低头看着，用力眨了眨眼睛。他点了点头，用力地嗅了嗅。“好的。”

“Okay?” Aziraphale echoed, scarcely daring to believe it.  
"好吗？"亚齐拉费尔回应道，几乎不敢相信。

Crowley looked at him, bright brown eyes swimming with emotion. “Okay. If you’ll have me.”  
克劳利看着他，明亮的棕色眼睛中充满了情感。"好的，如果你愿意接受我。"

Aziraphale’s breath hitched and he slipped his hand down to clasp Crowley’s. “Til the end of the world, darling.”  
亚齐拉费尔的呼吸突然停顿了一下，他的手滑下来握住了克劳利的手。“亲爱的，直到世界的尽头。”

Crowley gave a wet hiccough of a laugh. “Yeah.”    
克劳利湿漉漉地打了个嗝笑道：“是的。”

### Chapter Text 章节正文

The journey back to London had been made in silence, not out of a lack of things to say, but out of pure exhaustion.  
回伦敦的旅程一路上都是沉默的，不是因为没有话可说，而是因为彻底的疲惫。

Crowley sat beside the window and Aziraphale could see he was barely holding himself upright. He swayed to lean against the window, his head knocking against the glass.  
克劳利坐在窗边，阿齐拉费尔看得出他几乎支撑不住自己。他摇晃着靠在窗户上，头撞在玻璃上。

“No, darling,” Aziraphale said gently. When Crowley looked at him, his eyes clouded and confused, Aziraphale patted his own well-padded shoulder. He had replaced his smoke-damaged clothes, manifesting his attire for the first time in his long life, and the heavy, worn wool would be far softer than any glass.  
“亲爱的，不是这样的。”亚齐拉费尔温柔地说道。当克劳利看着他时，他的眼神变得迷茫和困惑，亚齐拉费尔轻拍了一下自己丰满的肩膀。他已经换上了被烟熏坏的衣服，第一次在他漫长的生命中展现出他的着装，那件厚重而磨损的羊毛衣比任何玻璃都要柔软得多。

For a long moment, Crowley only stared at him, then shifted his weight and laid his head on Aziraphale’s shoulders. His eyes fell closed instantly, his whole body slumping against Aziraphale’s side, fatigue engulfing him.  
克劳利沉默地盯着他看了很久，然后转移了重心，把头靠在亚齐拉费尔的肩膀上。他的眼睛立刻闭上了，整个身体倚靠在亚齐拉费尔的身旁，疲惫笼罩着他。

“That’s better, isn’t it?” Aziraphale murmured, gazing down at the unruly red hair so close to his cheek.  
“这样好多了，不是吗？”亚齐拉费尔低声说着，凝视着那一头不服管束的红发，离他的脸颊如此之近。

“Mm.” Crowley nestled closer and gave a small sigh that encapsulated relief, weariness and contentment.  
“嗯。”克劳利靠得更近了些，发出了一个小小的叹息，其中融合了宽慰、疲惫和满足。

Aziraphale looked down at his hands, clasping them one over the other in his lap. Better to let the little dear rest. He had earned it, holding Satan himself at bay, using powers that Aziraphale had not seen since the earliest days of the heavens and the earth.  
亚齐拉费尔低头看着自己的双手，交叠在膝上。最好让这个可爱的小家伙休息一下。他已经赢得了这个机会，抵挡住了撒旦本人，使用了亚齐拉费尔自从天地初开以来就没有见过的力量。

The driver had taken the demonic guidance, driving on after his final stop and into the heart of London. He blinked in confusion at them as Aziraphale gently shook Crowley awake and guided the angel out of the bus into the rain-sheened street. Out of kindness, on the angel’s behalf, he tossed a small roll of twenty pound notes back at the baffled human.  
司机听从了恶魔的指引，在最后一站之后继续驾驶，直奔伦敦市中心。他困惑地眨眼看着他们，阿齐拉费尔轻轻摇醒克劳利，引导天使走出公交车，踏上雨水洗净的街道。为了天使的善意，他把一卷小捆二十英镑纸币扔回给那个困惑的人。

“Here we are,” Aziraphale said, forcing joviality into his voice as they walked down the side-street towards the crossroads where his bookshop sat. Some part of him, he supposed, expected Crowley to change his mind.  
“我们到了，”亚齐拉费尔说道，他强迫自己的声音充满愉快，他们走在小街上朝着十字路口的方向前进，他的书店就坐落在那里。他想，或许克劳利会改变主意。

Crowley, still leaning on his arm, straightened up. “I’m sorry.”  
克劳利，仍然倚着手臂，挺直了身子。“对不起。”

Ah. There it was. 啊，就在那里。

“For what, my dear?” “为了什么，亲爱的？”

The angel looked at him, a flickering street lamp reflected in the dark pools of his eyes. “For… for waiting for so long.” A painfully sad smile crossed his face. “I thought I– it was– I was afraid. To come with you, I mean. As if I might be crossing a line I could never come back from.”  
天使看着他，一盏闪烁的路灯映在他眼中的黑暗深潭里。“为了……为了等待这么久。”一抹痛苦的悲伤微笑浮现在他的脸上。“我以为我——它——我害怕。和你一起走，我的意思是。好像我可能会越过一条无法回头的界线。”

The air left Aziraphale’s lungs in a rush. “Oh, darling,” he said, lifting a hand to cuff the silly dear’s cheek. “I’m patient. I would have waited for eternity, if need be.”  
阿齐拉费尔的呼吸一下子急促起来。“哦，亲爱的，”他说着，抬起手轻轻拍了拍这个可爱的家伙的脸颊。“我很有耐心。如果需要的话，我会等上永恒。”

Crowley brought a hand up to touch Aziraphale’s against his cheek, something like wonder in his expression. Then, to Aziraphale’s utter astonishment, he hugged him, wrapping his arms so tightly around Aziraphale’s middle, it would have cut off a mortal man’s air.  
克劳利抬起一只手，轻轻触碰着阿齐拉费尔的脸颊，他的表情中带着一丝惊讶。然后，令阿齐拉费尔完全惊讶的是，他拥抱了他，紧紧地将双臂环绕在阿齐拉费尔的腰间，这样紧紧地拥抱足以让一个凡人无法呼吸。

Tentatively, Aziraphale let himself embrace the angel. Crowley’s fingers were digging into his back and he was trembling like a leaf in Aziraphale’s arms.  
暂时地，亚齐拉费尔让自己拥抱了那位天使。克劳利的手指深深陷入他的背部，他在亚齐拉费尔的怀抱中颤抖得像片叶子。

“Not to seem ungrateful,” Aziraphale murmured, rubbing soothing circles on the angel’s back, “but why… this?”  
“不是要显得不感激，”亚齐拉费尔低声说道，一边在天使的背上轻轻地揉圆圈，“但为什么……是这个呢？”

Crowley’s breath was a hot gust against his throat. “Because,” he said, his voice unsteady. “Because…”  
克劳利的呼吸犹如一股炽热的风暴袭向他的喉咙。“因为，”他说道，声音有些颤抖。“因为……”

And Aziraphale realised in that moment that he didn’t really need to hear the words or to be told. “Hypothetically, I ought to say you’re welcome.” He patted between Crowley’s shoulders. “Come on, my dear. You’re stone cold.”  
而阿齐拉费尔在那一刻意识到，他并不真正需要听到那些话或被告知。“假设情况下，我应该说‘不客气’。”他拍了拍克劳利的肩膀。“来吧，亲爱的。你冷得像石头一样。”

Crowley nodded, loosening his grip enough to let Aziraphale open the door and guide him into the shop. Small lamps illuminated on the counter and the desks, casting a warm, welcoming glow, and Aziraphale hastily glanced about to make sure firstly that Hastur had not done any unnecessary damage and secondly to be certain that nothing too overwhelming or obvious was still lying around. The last thing he needed was to make the angel even more anxious.  
克劳利点了点头，松开握着的手，让阿齐拉费尔打开门，引导他走进店里。柜台和桌子上点亮了一些小灯，投射出温暖而热情的光芒，阿齐拉费尔匆忙四处瞥了一眼，首先确保哈斯特没有造成任何不必要的破坏，其次确保没有什么过于压抑或明显的东西还留在周围。他最不希望的就是让这位天使更加焦虑不安。

With great reluctance, he lifted his arm away from Crowley’s shoulders. “Make yourself at home,” he said. “I’ll put the kettle on. I think we both need a cup of tea.”  
他勉强地将手从克劳利的肩膀上移开。“请随便，”他说。“我去烧水。我想我们都需要喝杯茶。”

“Maybe a glass of wine?” Crowley’s voice still sounded brittle and frail. “If you have any?”  
“要不要来杯酒？”克劳利的声音依然脆弱而脆弱。“如果你有的话？”

“If I have any?” Aziraphale scoffed with the smallest of smiles. “What manner of demon do you think I am? _If_.” He shook his head. “Satan’s sake…” The quiet laugh that escaped from the angel made his smile broaden. He made a grand gesture around the shop. “There are couches, chairs, whatever you feel like. I’ll be back in a moment.”  
“如果我有的话？”阿齐拉费尔嗤笑着微微一笑。“你以为我是什么样的恶魔？如果。”他摇了摇头。“撒旦的缘故……”天使嘴角勾起一抹轻笑，笑容更加明朗。他在店里做了一个大手势。“有沙发、椅子，随便你喜欢什么。我马上回来。”

He retreated through into the back of the shop and down to the small wine cellar he had hidden beneath a trapdoor in the store room. Only there did he pause, resting his hand against a shelf, and take a long, shivering breath. Lord, his world was turned on its head and _Crowley_ was in his bookshop and Crowley was _Raziel_ and everything was the same and yet nothing was either.  
他退到店后面，沿着通往储藏室的小楼梯走到他藏在地板下的小酒窖。只有在那里，他才停下来，把手放在货架上，深深地吸了一口气。天啊，他的世界完全颠倒了，克劳利在他的书店里，克劳利是拉齐尔，一切都一样，但又什么都不一样。

Perhaps he took a little longer than was strictly necessary to pick a bottle – a rather nice Guigal La Landonne Cote-Rotie – but the last twenty-four hours had been nothing but rushing about and he needed a moment to breathe.  
也许他在挑选一瓶酒时花了比严格必要的时间更长一点——一瓶相当不错的吉加尔拉朗登科特罗蒂红葡萄酒——但过去的二十四小时里一直都是匆忙奔波，他需要一刻喘息的时间。

By the time he returned to the shop, Crowley had made his way through to the back. He was standing by Aziraphale’s desk, turning the pages of a book. No, not just a book. _The_ book. The last book Aziraphale had touched or looked at before… before everything.  
当他回到店里的时候，克劳利已经走到了后面。他站在阿齐拉费尔的办公桌旁，翻着一本书的页码。不，不只是一本书。那本书。在一切发生之前，阿齐拉费尔最后一次触摸或看过的书。

“They never forgave me, you know,” the angel said quietly, a single leaf held between forefinger and thumb. “For this. For giving it to the humans.” He laughed sadly. “Raziel of the Book. That was what they called me. Every time I went there. Every – any – time I did anything that diverged from my… divine orders.” He dropped the page, then closed over the book, tapping his fingertips lightly on the heavy leather cover. “They never let me forget it.”  
“你知道吗，他们从来没有原谅过我。”天使轻声说道，食指和拇指之间夹着一片树叶。“因为这个。因为我把它给了人类。”他悲伤地笑了笑。“书中的拉齐尔。那是他们给我的称号。每次我去那里，每次我做任何与神圣命令不符的事情。”他放下那页纸，然后合上书，轻轻地用指尖敲击着厚重的皮革封面。“他们从来没有让我忘记。”

Aziraphale’s hand shivered around the bottle, remembering Hastur’s words in the Bentley: _Hell does not forget. Hell does not forgive_. Funny that Heaven insisted they were so different, but were just as spiteful, petty and malevolent as the diabolical counterpart.  
阿齐拉费尔的手在瓶子周围颤抖着，回想起哈斯特在宾利车里说的话：地狱不会忘记。地狱不会原谅。有趣的是，天堂坚称它们与地狱截然不同，但却和邪恶的对立面一样恶毒、琐碎和恶意。

“No wonder you didn’t want anyone calling you that name,” he murmured, setting a pair of glasses down on the nearest table.  
“难怪你不想让别人叫你那个名字。”他低声说着，将一副眼镜放在最近的桌子上。

Crowley looked back at him. “I should have told you.”  
克劳利回头看着他。“我应该告诉你的。”

Aziraphale shrugged as nonchalantly as he could, working the cork out of the bottle. “I know why you didn’t.”  
亚齐拉费尔尽量漫不经心地耸了耸肩，拔出瓶塞说道：“我知道你为什么没有这么做。”

“Still.” Crowley wrapped his arms over his middle. “I _am_ sorry.”  
“还是。”克劳利双臂交叉在胸前。“我很抱歉。”

Aziraphale set down the bottle and crossed the floor to take Crowley by the shoulders. “Darling,” he said, waiting until the angel met his eyes, “You have done nothing wrong. You always said you were sent to protect and care for humanity, didn’t you?”  
亚齐拉费尔放下瓶子，走到克劳利身边，握住他的肩膀。“亲爱的，”他说着，等待着天使与他对视，“你没有做错任何事。你一直说你被派来保护和关心人类，对吗？”

“I suppose, but–” “我想是的，但是……”

“But nothing,” Aziraphale interrupted. “You’ve done what you were made to do.” He smiled. “In fact, you excelled at it so greatly that you left Heaven and Hell in the dust.” He leaned closer and pressed a gentle, chaste kiss to the angel’s cheek. “You have done _marvels_.”  
“但是什么都没有，”亚齐拉费尔打断道。“你已经完成了你的使命。”他微笑着说。“事实上，你做得非常出色，以至于超越了天堂和地狱。”他靠近一些，轻轻地在天使的脸颊上亲了一个温柔而纯洁的吻。“你做得太棒了。”

“But I still lied to you.”  
“但是我还是对你撒了谎。”

The demon considered him. “Did you?”  
恶魔注视着他。“你做了吗？”

“When you asked me who I was. In the Garden.”  
当你问我是谁的时候，在花园里。

Aziraphale shook his head. “I’ve heard this old chestnut more times than you can know, dearest,” he said gently. “I asked you who you were. You told me _your_ name. Not the name they gave you. Not the name they use to hurt you. _Your_ name. That’s something else entirely.” He cuffed Crowley’s cheek fondly. “It suits you far better.”  
亚齐拉费尔摇了摇头。“亲爱的，我听过这个老掉牙的说法比你能想象的还要多。”他温柔地说道。“我问你是谁，你告诉了我你的名字。不是他们给你的名字，也不是他们用来伤害你的名字。是你的名字。那是完全不同的东西。”他亲切地拍了拍克劳利的脸颊。“这个名字更适合你。”

The angel laughed unsteadily. “I suppose I did.” He smiled crookedly. “I asked them, you know. To call me Crowley. That went down like a lead balloon.”  
那位天使不稳地笑了起来。“我想我是这么做的。”他歪着嘴笑了笑。“你知道吗，我曾经要求他们叫我克劳利。结果那简直像是个失败的玩笑。”

“There you go, then.” Aziraphale’s smile widened. “I was the first person you chose to be yourself with.”  
“就是这样了。”亚齐拉费尔的微笑变得更加灿烂。“我是你选择与之真实相处的第一个人。”

“Yes,” Crowley said, searching his face. “I think you were. Are.”  
“是的，”克劳利说着，搜索着他的脸。“我认为你是。还是。”

Lord, it was so tempting to sweep the blessed creature into his arms and lavish all the affection and devotion that he so rightly deserved on him for every hour they had left. Had it been any other day, any other time, perhaps, perhaps he might have indulged in the whim.  
主啊，真是太诱人了，他多么想将这个可爱的生物拥入怀中，为他们所剩的每一个小时倾注所有的爱和痴迷。如果是在其他的日子，其他的时刻，或许，或许他会满足这个心血来潮。

But then again, perhaps not.  
但是再说，也许不是这样。

Now all their cards were on the table. Before, they never had been.  
现在他们所有的底牌都摆在了桌面上。以前从来没有过。

He satisfied himself with a light brush of a kiss to Crowley’s lips, then stepped back. “Come and sit, darling,” he said. “We need to–” As much as he hated to shatter the quiet comfortable mood between them, reality was weighing too heavily on him. “We must plan for what is coming.”  
他满足地轻轻地亲吻了克劳利的嘴唇，然后退后一步。“来坐下，亲爱的，”他说。“我们需要……”尽管他不愿打破他们之间宁静舒适的氛围，但现实对他来说太过沉重。“我们必须为即将到来的事情做好计划。”

Crowley retreated a couple of steps and folded down onto the couch there, sinking back against the cushions and throws. “What _is_ coming?”  
克劳利退了几步，坐到了那张沙发上，沉静地靠在靠垫和毯子上。“接下来会发生什么？”

Aziraphale wrested the cork from the bottle and poured them each a glass of wine. “Heaven,” he said, as he carried the two glasses over. There were plenty of seats to choose from, but where else could he sit but by Crowley’s side? “Hell.”  
亚齐拉费尔夺过瓶塞，给他们每人倒了一杯酒。“天堂，”他说着，一边拿着两杯酒走过去。这里有很多座位可供选择，但他除了坐在克劳利身边，还能坐在哪里呢？“地狱。”

Crowley’s hands shivered around the glass. “You think they’ll come?”  
克劳利的手在玻璃杯周围颤抖着。“你认为他们会来吗？”

“Mm.” Aziraphale sank deeper into the couch, stretching out his legs. “Last time I saw Hastur, he was swearing vengeance, and then we not only gave lip to the Archangel Gabriel and Lord Beelzebub, while thoroughly ruining their plans, but we utterly humiliated Lucifer. I don’t imagine anyone will be very happy with us.”  
“嗯。”亚齐拉费尔深陷在沙发里，伸展着双腿。“上次我见到哈斯特时，他发誓要报复，然后我们不仅对大天使加百列和贝利尔大人说了些刺耳的话，还彻底破坏了他们的计划，彻底羞辱了魔王路西法。我想没人会对我们感到满意。”

Crowley nodded unhappily. “Why couldn’t they just leave everything as it was?” he demanded. “Everything was going so smoothly. Humans and demons and angels and everything.”  
克劳利不满地点了点头。“他们为什么不能把一切都保持原样呢？”他质问道。“一切都进行得如此顺利。人类、恶魔、天使，一切都在和谐共处。”

“You know that lot.” Aziraphale made a face. “Them and their damned war.” He sighed. “Do not forget, do not forgive, that’s what he said.”  
“你知道那帮人。”亚齐拉费尔皱了皱眉。“他们和他们那该死的战争。”他叹了口气。“别忘了，别原谅，那就是他说的。”

“He?” “他？”

“Hastur.” Aziraphale cast a sidelong look at the angel. “You helped me get away from him, y’know.”  
“哈斯特。”亚齐拉费尔斜眼看了一眼天使。“你知道，是你帮助我逃离了他。”

Crowley blinked over the rim of his glass. “I did?”  
克劳利从玻璃杯的边缘眨了眨眼睛。“我做了吗？”

“Mm. Your book. Some handy spells of confinement.”  
“嗯，你的书。一些方便的禁锢咒语。”

Crowley’s already wide eyes went a little wider. “You _read_…” He groaned. “Oh! That’s what happened to your face, isn’t it? For Heaven’s sake, Aziraphale! You need to take more care of yourself!”  
克劳利的眼睛已经很大了，现在更加睁得大大的。“你读过……”他叹了口气。“哦！这就是你脸上发生的事情吧？天哪，阿齐拉费尔！你需要更加照顾自己！”

Aziraphale wondered if it was possible for his heart to swell with emotion. “Don’t get soft on me now, angel,” he warned. “We can’t get all soppy. We have a real problem coming our way.”  
亚齐拉费尔心里想着，他的心是否可能因为情感而膨胀。“别对我变得软弱，天使，”他警告道。“我们不能变得过于感伤。我们面临着一个真正的问题。”

Crowley studied him, then shuffled along the couch to lean against him. “I can be soft and get the job done,” he said with a dignified sniff. “So there.”  
克劳利打量了他一眼，然后挪动身体靠在他身边的沙发上。“我可以温柔地完成任务，”他带着尊严的鼻息说道。“就这样。”

Aziraphale gazed at him, then unfurled his arm to wrap it around the angel, drawing him even closer. “So I can see.” He nuzzled Crowley’s hair. “I can’t help thinking our Nutter witch was trying to give us a hint.”  
亚齐拉费尔凝视着他，然后伸开手臂将天使拥入怀中，更加亲近地靠近他。“这样我就能看到了。”他蹭了蹭克劳利的头发。“我忍不住觉得我们那个疯狂的女巫是在给我们暗示。”

Crowley made a curious sound. “You think she knew you’d catch the burned page?”  
克劳利发出了一个好奇的声音。“你觉得她知道你会找到那张烧焦的页面吗？”

“Could be. Your notes suggest she knew what she was on about.” He gave Crowley’s shoulders a squeeze. “He’s not who he says he is, for example.”  
可能吧。你的笔记表明她知道自己在说什么。”他轻轻拍了拍克劳利的肩膀。“比如说，他并不是他所声称的那个人。”

Crowley spluttered into his wine, his face going a charming shade of red. “You don’t know that was about me.”  
克劳利喷了一口酒，脸上泛起迷人的红晕。“你不知道那是关于我。”

“You don’t know it wasn’t.” Aziraphale set his glass on the arm of the chair and fished out the fragment again, holding it so they could both read it. “What do you suppose it means? Choosing our faces wisely?”  
“你不知道它不是。”亚齐拉费尔把杯子放在椅子扶手上，再次取出碎片，让他们都能看到。 “你觉得它是什么意思？明智地选择我们的面孔？”

“I’m more worried about the playing with fire bit,” Crowley admitted. “I know Heaven are... well, they’re not going to be merciful this time around. I’ve embarrassed them too many times.”  
“我更担心那个玩火的部分，”克劳利承认道。“我知道天堂……嗯，这次他们不会心慈手软。我给他们丢脸的次数太多了。”

“But you haven’t Fallen,” Aziraphale pointed out. “Which means someone higher than them doesn’t think you should Fall. Surely that should satisfy them.”  
“但是你并没有堕落，”亚齐拉费尔指出。“这意味着比他们更高的存在并不认为你应该堕落。这应该能满足他们了吧。”

“It didn’t satisfy them when She gave the book back to humanity,” Crowley said, his lip curling. He must have noticed Aziraphale’s confusion. “I gave it to Adam and Eve. Some angels stole it and cast it into the sea to keep it from humanity. She gave it back to them. They couldn’t really shout at her, so they settled for shouting at me.”  
“当她把书还给人类时，他们并不满意。”克劳利说着，嘴角勾起一丝冷笑。他一定注意到了阿齐拉费尔的困惑。“我把书给了亚当和夏娃。一些天使偷走了它，把它扔进海里，以防止它落入人类手中。她把它还给了他们。他们无法真正对她大声喊叫，所以他们选择对我大声喊叫。”

A low growl rumbled in Aziraphale’s chest. “I really don’t like angels. Present company excepted, of course.” He lifted his hand to brush Crowley’s cheek again. “What do you think they would do?”  
阿齐拉费尔的胸腔里传来低沉的咆哮声。“我真的不喜欢天使。当然，除了在场的你。”他抬起手再次抚摸克劳利的脸颊。“你觉得他们会怎么做呢？”

“At bare minimum? I wouldn’t be surprised if Gabriel called Pax enough to get hold of Hellfire.”  
“至少？如果加布里埃尔打了足够的电话给帕克，以便得到地狱之火，我不会感到惊讶。”

Aziraphale stared at him in horror. “No.”  
亚齐拉费尔惊恐地盯着他。“不。”

Crowley shrugged with a sad smile. “Can’t be an embarrassing problem anymore if you wipe it from existence.” He raised his eyebrows. “What about you? Do you think they’ll be generous and forgiving?”  
克劳利苦笑着耸了耸肩。“如果你抹去了它，那就不再是一个令人尴尬的问题了。”他挑了挑眉。“你呢？你觉得他们会慷慨宽容吗？”

Aziraphale shook his head. “I killed one of our kind. That doesn’t get excused.”  
亚齐拉费尔摇了摇头。“我杀了一个同类。这是不能被原谅的。”

“You… did?” "你...做了吗？"

“Ligur.” He could still recall the scent of it. “Holy water.” He managed a wan smile. “A certain precaution that you helped me with a few years back.”  
“利古尔。”他仍能回忆起那股香气。“圣水。”他勉强笑了笑。“你几年前帮助过我的一种预防措施。”

“Ohhhh.” Crowley’s eyes widened as if he had suddenly understood a long-standing puzzle. “That was what you needed it for!”  
“哦哦哦。”克劳利的眼睛瞪大了，仿佛他突然理解了一个长期以来的谜题。“那就是你需要它的原因！”

“What did you think I wanted it for?” Aziraphale gave him a squeeze. “Thought you’d be getting rid of me a bit sooner, did you?”  
“你以为我要它做什么？”亚齐拉费尔紧紧地拥抱着他。“你以为你会早点摆脱我，是吗？”

The angel nudged him in the ribs. “Shut up.”  
天使用肘部轻推了他一下。“闭嘴。”

Aziraphale chuckled fondly. “So…” He traced his fingers up and down Crowley’s upper arm, sinking back into thought. “They’ll come for us and will no doubt have modes of execution generously supplied by our mutual employers, because Lord knows we embarrassed everyone.”  
亚齐拉费尔深情地笑了笑。“那么……”他用手指轻轻地在克劳利的上臂上划过，陷入了思考。“他们会来找我们，毫无疑问，而且肯定会有各种刑罚方式，这些都是我们共同的雇主慷慨提供的，因为天知道我们让每个人都感到尴尬。”

“Mm.” Crowley plucked the piece of paper from his fingers. “Do you think that’s what she means about choosing faces?”  
“嗯。”克劳利从他的手指上拿走了那张纸。“你觉得她说的选择面孔是指这个吗？”

Aziraphale watched as the angel turned the piece of paper over and over between his fingers. “They know us to find us, so maybe we need to… use someone else as a mask? I mean, we know angels can possess people as much as demons can now.”  
亚齐拉费尔看着天使将那张纸反复翻动在手指间。“他们知道我们的行踪，也许我们需要……用别人作为伪装？我的意思是，我们现在知道天使和恶魔一样可以附身于人。”

“Ah, ah!” Crowley held up a finger. “Wasn’t possession.”  
“啊，啊！”克劳利举起一根手指。“不是附身。”

“Were you or were you not sharing the body of a very generous and affectionate sex worker?”  
你是不是和一个非常慷慨和亲切的性工作者共享身体？

Crowley gave him a long, stern look. “Still wasn’t possession, not in the technical sense. Possession is taking over. What I did…” He hummed, snuggling closer to Aziraphale’s side. “You’ve read my book, haven’t you?”  
克劳利给了他一个长而严厉的眼神。“从技术上讲，那还不算是附身。附身是完全接管。我所做的……”他哼了一声，更亲近地靠在亚齐拉费尔的身边。“你读过我的书，对吧？”

“As much as I could manage,” Aziraphale confirmed, taking a sip of his wine.  
“尽我所能，”亚齐拉费尔肯定地说着，一边品尝着他的葡萄酒。

“It was more… like the aspects of the spirit I mentioned there.” He drained the rest of his glass and studied it thoughtfully. “Bodies are just vessels, right? Like this? Everything living has a vessel for their soul, yeah?”  
“更像是我之前提到的精神的方面。”他喝光了杯中的酒，若有所思地凝视着它。“身体只是容器，对吧？就像这个？每个有生命的东西都有一个容纳灵魂的容器，对吧？”

“Technically, yes.” 从技术上讲，是的。

The angel gave him a smile. “We _don’t_. I mean, angels and demons. Generally, we don’t. Humans do, but they have plenty of space leftover. Possession is taking all of it. I just… borrowed some of that space until Adam restored my body for me.”  
天使对他微笑着说：“我们不会。我的意思是，天使和恶魔。通常我们不会。人类会，但他们有很多剩余的空间。附身占据了所有的空间。我只是...借用了一些那个空间，直到亚当为我恢复了身体。”

“And that’s why discorporation is such a bugger,” Aziraphale agreed with a nod. “Someone broke our vessel and we’re just sloshing around back in our usual form.”  
“这就是为什么解体如此讨厌，”亚齐拉费尔点头表示同意。“有人破坏了我们的容器，我们只能以我们通常的形态四处晃荡。”

Crowley stared at him, then looked back at his glass. “Huh.”  
克劳利盯着他看了一会儿，然后又看向自己的杯子。“嗯。”

Aziraphale tilted his head to peer at him. “What?”  
亚齐拉费尔歪着头凝视着他。“什么？”

“Hm?” “嗯？”

“You said ‘huh’. What are you thinking?”  
你说了“嗯”。你在想什么？

Crowley was frowning, but thoughtfully. “I think…” He got up from the couch, then reached down and snatched Aziraphale’s glass from his hand.  
克劳利皱着眉头，但是思考着。“我想……”他从沙发上站起来，然后伸手夺过了阿齐拉费尔手中的杯子。

“Hey!” 嘿！

“Hold on, hold on…” He waved a finger at the demon, then turned, walking across the floor, his back to Aziraphale. “Huh…” When he turned around, he was chewing his lip, but had both glasses held out in front of him, the contents concealed by his hands. “Which one is yours?”  
“等一下，等一下……”他向恶魔挥了挥手指，然后转身，背对着亚齐拉费尔。 “嗯……”当他转过身来时，他咬着嘴唇，但双手伸出，眼镜放在他面前，内容物被他的手遮住。“哪个是你的？”

Aziraphale made a face. “I didn’t agree to you playing games with my wine.”  
亚齐拉费尔皱了皱眉头。“我可没同意你拿我的酒来玩游戏。”

“I’m serious!” Crowley met his eyes. “Tell me which one is yours.”  
“我是认真的！”克劳利与他对视着。“告诉我哪一个是你的。”

“I can’t,” Aziraphale said impatiently. “I can’t see what’s insi…” His mouth fell open. “Oh.”  
“我不行，”阿齐拉费尔不耐烦地说道。“我看不见里面是什么……”他的嘴巴张大了。“哦。”

“Uh-huh.” "嗯嗯。"

“OHHH!!!” "哦！！！"

“YES!” "是的！"

Aziraphale scrambled up. “They don’t look at what’s inside. They only look at the vessel.”  
亚齐拉费尔艰难地爬起来。“他们不关心里面的东西，只看外表。”

“And if they base their assumption that the vessel and the person inside are one in the same…”  
“如果他们基于这样的假设，即船只和其中的人是同一个…”

“Any punishments they use will be targeting the face they see in front of them.” Aziraphale caught Crowley’s face between his hands. “You beautiful genius!”  
他们使用的任何惩罚都将针对他们眼前所见的人。亚齐拉费尔用双手捧住克劳利的脸。“你这个美丽的天才！”

Crowley’s face lit up in a shining smile. “Stop that,” he said, laughing, and nudging Aziraphale’s arms away. He looked between the glasses. “It would work, I think. I mean, I can stand the touch of holy water and you can deal with hellfire.”  
克劳利的脸上露出了灿烂的笑容。“别闹了，”他笑着说着，推开了阿齐拉费尔的手臂。他看着眼镜之间。“我觉得这会起作用。我的意思是，我可以忍受圣水的触碰，而你可以应对地狱之火。”

“Yes…” Aziraphale nodded, his thumbs brushing against Crowley’s cheeks. “Yes, but would they be convinced? I mean, if they – perish the thought – hold a trial? Could I really pretend to be you? I can’t put you in dang–”  
“是的……”亚齐拉菲尔点了点头，他的拇指轻轻划过克劳利的脸颊。“是的，但他们会相信吗？我的意思是，如果他们——不敢想象——要进行审判？我真的能假装成你吗？我不能让你陷入危险之中——”

Crowley switched the glasses to one hand and reached up, wrapping his free hand around the back of Aziraphale’s head, his face so unbearably and wonderfully close that Aziraphale entirely forgot what he was trying to say.  
克劳利将眼镜换到一只手上，伸手抬起，用自由的手臂环绕住阿齐拉费尔的后脑勺，他们的脸离得如此近，令阿齐拉费尔完全忘记了他想要说什么。

“I _know_ you, Aziraphale,” Crowley said, his eyes dark and gleaming. “I’ve known you as long as you’ve known me. No one knows us better than we know each other, _especially_ not anyone in Heaven or Hell.”  
“我认识你，阿齐拉费尔，”克劳利说道，他的眼睛黑暗而闪亮。“我认识你的时间和你认识我的时间一样长。没有人比我们更了解彼此，尤其不是天堂或地狱中的任何人。”

“So what’s the best way to do this, then?” Aziraphale said, feeling more than a little shaken by the intensity of Crowley’s gaze. “I can shapeshift with the best of them, though I always have a little trouble if I need to change my eyes.”  
“那么，最好的方法是什么？”亚齐拉费尔有些被克劳利那强烈的目光所震撼，说道：“我可以像他们一样变形，尽管如果需要改变我的眼睛，我总是有些困难。”

Crowley shook his head, his fingers thoughtfully curling in Aziraphale’s hair. “Shapeshifting won’t be enough, not to fool them. The scent, the energy of the vessel is very particular.”  
克劳利摇了摇头，他的手指在阿齐拉费尔的头发间思索地弯曲着。“变形不足以欺骗他们。容器的气味和能量非常特殊。”

That, Aziraphale, knew was certainly true. Crowley always carried the faintest scents of incense, wine and the polish and leather of the Bentley.  
那一点，阿齐拉费尔深知是真的。克劳利身上总是带着淡淡的香味，有着熏香、葡萄酒、宾利车的抛光和皮革的气息。

“But,” he said, frowning, “what other choice do we have?”  
“但是，”他皱着眉头说道，“我们还有什么其他选择呢？”

The angel stared at him, chewing his lips. “Do you trust me?” he finally asked.  
天使盯着他，咬着嘴唇。“你相信我吗？”他最终问道。

“Darling, you _know_–” “亲爱的，你知道——”

“No,” Crowley interrupted, his voice gentle but firm. “This isn’t something small. This is your life – our lives – and it’s… well, it’s never been done before, not that I know of. If we do this… I need to know you trust me not to damage us.”  
“不，”克劳利打断道，声音温和而坚定。“这不是小事。这关乎你的生活 - 我们的生活 - 而且...嗯，据我所知，这从未发生过。如果我们这样做...我需要知道你相信我不会伤害我们。”

Aziraphale searched his face. “The answer is the same, regardless.” He ran his thumb along Crowley’s cheek again. “What do you have in mind?”  
亚齐拉费尔注视着他的脸。“答案无论如何都是一样的。”他再次用拇指沿着克劳利的脸颊轻抚。“你有什么打算？”

The angel stepped back and brought up the glasses between them, pouring the wine from one into the other.  
天使退后一步，拿起两只酒杯，将其中一只的酒倒入另一只中。

Aziraphale stared at the glasses, then back at him. “Change the vess… we _switch_? Is that even possible?”  
亚齐拉费尔盯着眼镜，然后又看向他。“改变容器...我们换？这真的可能吗？”

The blazing smile that spread across Crowley’s features utterly stole his breath away. “I think so.” He held out the filled glass and Aziraphale took it gratefully. Lord, he had never needed a drink quite as much in his life. “I gave the humans a lot,” Crowley continued, “but I didn’t give them _everything_.”  
克劳利脸上绽放出灿烂的笑容，让他完全失去了呼吸。"我想是的。"他递出装满酒的杯子，亚齐拉费尔感激地接过。天啊，他这辈子从未如此需要一杯酒。"我给了人类很多，"克劳利继续说道，"但并没有把一切都给他们。"

Aziraphale looked over at the desk. “There’s _more_ than that?”  
亚齐拉费尔望向桌子。“还有其他的吗？”

“Oh yes.” Crowley’s eyes shone like embers. “And I bet the others don’t even remember half of it now. They never paid attention to the important stuff.” He put down his empty glass. “It’s– it won’t be simple, but I _know_ I can do it.” He searched Aziraphale’s face. “Would you trust me?”  
“哦，是的。”克劳利的眼睛闪烁着余烬般的光芒。“我敢打赌其他人现在连一半都记不起来了。他们从来没有关注过重要的事情。”他放下空杯。“这不会简单，但我知道我能做到。”他搜索着亚齐拉费尔的脸。“你会相信我吗？”

Aziraphale’s world was shaking underfoot and he had to drain the rest of his glass, trying to gather himself. “You’d have to trust me too, wouldn’t you?” he said. “With your life and everything in between?”  
阿齐拉费尔的世界在他脚下摇晃不已，他不得不把剩下的酒一饮而尽，试图让自己恢复过来。“你也得相信我，不是吗？”他说。“把你的生命和一切都交托给我？”

The angel nodded. “And I do.”  
天使点了点头。“我知道。”

Lord, he wished he hadn’t finished the drink so quickly.  
他真希望自己没有那么快喝完这杯酒。

He swallowed hard around the lump that had no only settled in his throat but that seemed to be spreading to fill his entire chest. “How? This. How do we do it?”  
他艰难地咽了口唾沫，感觉不仅是喉咙里有一个硬块，而且似乎正在扩散，充满了整个胸腔。“怎么办？这个。我们该怎么做？”

Crowley reached out and took the glass from his fingers. “It’s better if I show you.” He stepped closer and the twitch of his lips couldn’t remotely be called innocent or virtuous. “How about it, Aziraphale? Will you let me inside you?”  
克劳利伸手拿过他手中的玻璃杯。“我最好给你演示一下。”他走近一步，嘴角的抽搐一点也不能被称为无辜或者正直。“怎么样，阿齐拉费尔？你会让我进入你的内心吗？”

Aziraphale, demon of the lower pits, tempter, corrupter, and Fallen Angel, blushed like a sunrise. “Oh _really_, my darling! You are _dreadful_.”  
阿齐拉费尔，地狱深渊的恶魔，诱惑者，腐化者和堕落天使，像日出一样脸红了起来。“哦，亲爱的！你真是可怕。”

As Crowley took Aziraphale’s face between his hands, he laughed. “Like calls to like,” he said fondly. “You in?”  
当克劳利用双手握住阿齐拉费尔的脸时，他笑了起来。“物以类聚，”他亲切地说道。“你参与吗？”

Aziraphale searched his face, then reached out and caught him by the hips, pulling him closer. “Until,” he promised, “the end of the world.”  
亚齐拉费尔搜索了他的脸，然后伸手抓住他的臀部，将他拉得更近。“直到”，他承诺道，“世界的尽头。”

“Good.” Crowley shone with the light of his smile, every inch of him as dazzling as the highest order of angels. He touched his brow to Aziraphale’s. “Hold on tight and don’t let go.”  
“好。” 克劳利笑容满面，他的每一寸都闪耀着最高级别天使的光芒。他把额头轻轻贴在亚齐拉费尔的额头上。“紧紧抓住，别松手。”

_Never_, Aziraphale promised without words, wrapping his arms around the angel’s middle. _Never_.  
亚齐拉费尔默默地承诺，双臂环绕住天使的腰间。永不。

### Chapter Text 章节正文

An angel and a demon left a bookshop in Soho.  
一个天使和一个恶魔离开了苏豪区的一家书店。

One of them took a taxi in the direction St. Dunstan’s Hill, while the other made his way down to Chinatown to visit a small bakery he was known to frequent. Both of them had routines to follow, after all, though a few of the demon’s regular servers noticed he only picked at his food.  
其中一个乘坐出租车前往圣邓斯坦山，而另一个则下到唐人街去拜访一个他经常光顾的小面包店。毕竟，他们两个都有自己的日常习惯，尽管一些恶魔常客的服务员注意到他只是玩弄食物。

Meanwhile, in St Dunstan’s hill, the angel stood in front of the building that should have – by all the laws of physics and time – been a smouldering ruin. Instead, the windows shone as if freshly-washed, the overlap of the old stone building and the much later renovations so crisp and sharp they might have been brand new.  
与此同时，在圣邓斯坦山，天使站在一座本应该根据物理和时间的规律成为一片燃烧废墟的建筑物前。然而，窗户闪耀着如新洗过的光芒，古老石建筑与后来的翻新交错之处如此清晰锐利，仿佛崭新一样。

And technically, they were.  
从技术上讲，他们是的。

If that was whole, then…  
如果那是全部的话，那么…

The angel unlocked the gates and pushed them open, a wide smile spreading across his face at the sight of the Bentley, intact and gleaming and as perfect as it had been 24 hours earlier.  
天使打开了大门，推开它们，一看到那辆宾利，他脸上露出了灿烂的微笑，它完好无损，闪闪发光，就像24小时前一样完美。

“There you are, you old bastard,” he murmured, running a hand along bonnet.  
“你在那儿，你这个老混蛋。”他低声说着，用手沿着引擎盖轻轻摩擦着。

A further investigation revealed that every inch of the former church had been restored to the condition it had been in the day before, though certainly before some absolute idiot tried to direct-dial God, since the floors was clear of all sigils and marks.  
进一步的调查揭示出，这座教堂的每一寸都已经恢复到之前的状态，当然是在某个绝对白痴试图直拨上帝电话之前的状态，因为地板上已经清除了所有的符号和标记。

Whatever the young Antichrist had done or – perhaps more accurately – undone, it had been thorough.  
无论年轻的反基督者做了什么或者更准确地说，是未做什么，他都做得彻底。

The angel made a full circuit of the grounds, making a show of bending and examining some of the plants. Not that it was unusual, but today, there seemed to be more deliberation in the way he checked everything, as if he had to make sure everyone saw him and knew he was there, in his private property.  
天使绕着庭院走了一圈，故意弯下身子检查一些植物。虽然这并不是什么不寻常的事情，但今天他似乎更加仔细地检查每一样东西，好像他必须确保每个人都看到他，并知道他在自己的私人领地上。

Likewise, in Soho, the demon carried a stack of cake and sweet boxes back into the bookshop, though the sign on the door remained resolutely turned to “Closed”. Through the dimpled glass, he was visible, moving around, checking books and taking stock.  
同样，在Soho区，恶魔提着一堆蛋糕和甜品盒子走进书店，尽管门上的标志坚定地显示着“关门”，但他依然进入了店内。透过凹凸玻璃，他可以被看见，四处走动，检查书籍和盘点库存。

At exactly noon, both angel and demon left their facilities and headed in the direction of St. James’s Park, though it is worth noticing that the angel didn’t even try to get into the Bentley, choosing to take a taxi instead, while the demon ignored all taxis to make his way on foot.  
正午准时，天使和恶魔都离开了他们的设施，朝着圣詹姆斯公园的方向前进，值得注意的是，天使甚至没有试图进入宾利车，而选择坐出租车，而恶魔则无视所有的出租车，选择步行前行。

They met, as if by complete coincidence, at the ice cream stand near the duckpond. The demon sauntered, though his hands were thrust into his capacious pockets. The angel, on the other hand, was watchful and guarded.  
他们在鸭池附近的冰淇淋摊位上，仿佛完全巧合地相遇了。恶魔悠闲地走着，虽然双手插在宽大的口袋里。而天使则警觉而谨慎。

“A ninety-nine,” the demon said, “and a strawberry split, please.” He accepted them with a quick smile at the vendor, offering the bright red lolly to the angel. “Good day for it, don’t you think?”  
“九十九块钱，”恶魔说道，“再来一个草莓分体，请。”他快速地对摊贩微笑着接过了它们，将鲜红的棒棒糖递给了天使。“今天天气不错，吃这个再合适不过了，你觉得呢？”

“Mm.” The angel paced in a slow circle around him, darting licks against the lolly. “Everything seems to be back to normal.” He slanted a dark-eyed look at the demon. “_Everything_.”  
“嗯。”天使在他周围缓慢地踱步，舔着棒棒糖。"一切似乎恢复正常了。”他斜眼看着恶魔。“一切。”

The demon’s lips twitched as if he was fighting a smile. “That so?”  
恶魔的嘴唇抽动了一下，好像他在忍住笑容。“是吗？”

“Mm.” The angel nibbled the lolly, his eyes flicking around. “Any word from your people?”  
“嗯。”天使咬了一口棒棒糖，眼睛四处扫视着。“你们那边有消息吗？”

The demon shook his head. His ice cream was melting, drops slowly rolling down the side of the cone. “Not so far. You?” The angel coughed pointedly, shaking his head, and the demon grimaced, licking up some of the creamy mess, then contemplated the flake. “If everything is back– I mean, if he’s– do you know what that means? I mean, after everything that happened yesterday?”  
恶魔摇了摇头。他的冰淇淋正在融化，滴落在蛋筒的边缘。"没那么远。你呢？"天使有意咳嗽了一下，摇了摇头，恶魔皱了皱眉，舔了一些奶油状的混乱，然后思考着那片薄片。“如果一切都恢复了——我的意思是，如果他——你知道那意味着什么吗？我是说，昨天发生的一切之后？”

The angel shrugged. “Lord knows,” he murmured. “I mean, I thought I did, but then, some of it’s a little too…” He waved the lolly.  
天使耸了耸肩。“只有上帝知道，”他低声说道。“我的意思是，我以为我知道，但是，有些事情有点太……”他挥了挥手中的棒棒糖。

A thrumming voice made them both turn sharply. “Ineffable.”  
一个低沉的声音让他们俩都猛地转过头来。“难以言喻。”

Only a stone’s throw away, a cloaked and skulled figured nodded in greeting.  
只有一箭之遥，一个蒙面而骷髅头的人点头示意打招呼。

“Oh no,” the demon breathed. “Oh, that’s not– okay, yeah, maybe not an omen or thingie… what’s it called again? Porte–” He turned back only to find the angel was not beside him. The demon’s eyes widened in panic and he spun around, searching the park.  
“哦不，”恶魔喘息着说。“哦，那不是——好吧，是的，也许不是一个预兆或者什么东西……它叫什么来着？门口——”他转身回头，却发现天使不在他身旁。恶魔惊慌地睁大眼睛，四处转身，在公园里搜索。

There! The angel was being dragged backwards, kicking and flailing uselessly in the grip of a pair of angels.  
那里！那个天使被一对天使紧紧抓住，往后拖着，无助地踢打着。

“Stop them!” he shouted, before he could stop himself, throwing the ice cream inside and running after them, but a blow caught him hard across the back of his head, knocking him spinning, and his legs folded under him. His knees hit the pavement and as he folded forward, he saw the red-headed body of the angel vanish in the hands of the angels.  
“阻止他们！”他大喊一声，还来不及控制自己，就把手中的冰淇淋扔了进去，然后追了上去。但是一记重击猛烈地击中了他的后脑勺，让他头晕目眩，双腿无力。他的膝盖撞在了地面上，当他前倾身体时，他看到了那个红发天使的身影在其他天使的手中消失了。

“What’s the matter, love?”  
“发生了什么事，亲爱的？”

He rolled onto his side to peer up at the demon formerly known as a tiny Korean tourist. Hastur grinned back at him.  
他侧身向一旁滚动，仰望着曾经是一个小韩国游客的恶魔。哈斯图尔朝他咧嘴一笑。

“S’fine,” the fallen demon slurred, his world swimming. “All good.”  
“没事，”倒地的恶魔含糊地说道，他的世界在旋转。“一切都好。”

His vision went black as he sagged back down on the pavement.  
他的视线变黑，他无力地倒在人行道上。

Aziraphale tested the cords twined around his wrists.  
亚齐拉费尔试探着缠绕在他手腕上的绳索。

They weren’t especially thick, but Divine power throbbed through them, enough to keep a rogue angel well and truly restrained. They were, however, pulled unnecessarily tight against Crowley’s narrow wrists, biting hard into his skin.  
它们并不特别厚，但神圣的力量在其中脉动，足以将一个流氓天使牢牢束缚住。然而，它们却不必要地紧紧勒在克劳利狭窄的手腕上，狠狠地咬进他的皮肤。

He was pinioned to a heavy chair in the middle of a glacially-cold white room, all the wonders of the world visible beyond the glassy walls. It had been a long time since he had seen Heaven, but oh, it was so much worse than he remembered. As were the angels.  
他被钉在一个冰冷的白色房间的中央的一把沉重的椅子上，透过玻璃墙壁可以看到世界的奇迹。他已经很久没有见到天堂了，但是哦，它比他记忆中的要糟糕得多。天使们也是如此。

Uriel had tied him down and smiled darkly while doing so. He watched them, eyes appropriately wide, counting the golden scales on their face, imagining the utter pleasure it would be to pluck them out one by one. When they ripped the gag away, he took a long, slow breath, never taking his eyes from their face.  
乌里尔把他绑住，一边做着这件事一边阴森地笑着。他注视着他们，眼睛适当地睁大，数着他们脸上的金色鳞片，想象着一颗一颗地拔出它们会带来的极度快感。当他们扯掉口球时，他深深地吸了一口气，从未将目光离开他们的脸。

So this one liked hurting Crowley, did they? Good to know.  
所以这个人喜欢伤害克劳利，是吗？好知道。

He heard the footsteps approaching a moment before a hand caught him by the shoulder, squeezing. “Raziel.” The Archangel Gabriel stepped into his line of vision, smiling as pleasantly as Uriel. “So glad you could join us.”  
他在一只手抓住他的肩膀之前，听到了脚步声逐渐逼近的声音。“拉齐尔。”大天使加百列走进他的视线范围，脸上带着和乌列尔一样愉快的微笑。“很高兴你能加入我们。”

Aziraphale considered him, curling his fingers over the arm of the chair. “You’ve got my phone number,” he said. “Isn’t kidnapping someone in broad daylight overkill?”  
亚齐拉费尔注视着他，手指轻轻握住椅子扶手。“你有我的电话号码，”他说。“在大白天绑架一个人是不是有点过分了？”

Gabriel laughed as if he’d made a joke. “Call it was! An extraordinary rendition.”  
加布里埃尔笑了起来，好像他开了个玩笑。“叫它吧！一次非同寻常的演绎。”

And there, in two little words, Heaven had damned itself all over again.  
就在那里，用两个小小的字，天堂再次自我毁灭了。

“Now!” Gabriel continued, raising a finger. “Have we heard from our new associate?”  
“现在！”加布里埃尔继续说道，抬起一根手指。“我们收到了新合作伙伴的消息吗？”

“He’s on his way,” Uriel replied coolly.  
"他正在赶来，"乌里尔冷静地回答道。

Gabriel’s smile widened into an unpleasant grin. “He’s on his way.” The glee and triumph in his voice really demanded that he be punched hard in the teeth. “I think you’re gonna like this, I really do.” The Archangel leaned in, smug and utterly condescending, “And I bet you didn’t see this one coming.”  
加百列的微笑变得更加讨人厌的咧嘴笑容。“他正在赶来的路上。”他的声音中充满了喜悦和胜利，真的让人有冲动狠狠地揍他一顿。“我想你会喜欢这个的，真的。”大天使倚近过来，得意而完全傲慢，“而且我敢打赌，你没有预料到这一点。”

_Oh darling_, Aziraphale thought, fighting down the malicious grin that was threatening to come, _you have no idea_.  
哦，亲爱的，阿齐拉费尔心想，他努力压制住即将涌上心头的邪恶笑容，你一点都不知道。

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So. 所以。

This was Hell, was it?  
这就是地狱吗？

It was dark and grim and pretty much every Crowley had expected. Flickering lights along the ceiling made him squint and he could hear the faint electrical torture device that was a modem redialling over and over again somewhere in the gloom.  
黑暗而阴郁，几乎与克劳利所预料的一样。天花板上闪烁的灯光让他眯起眼睛，他能听到模糊的电刑装置声音，一个调制解调器在黑暗中不停地重新拨号。

His burly guards hauled him along – no, hauled Aziraphale along. It was definitely a lot more work than they would have had, if he’d been in his own body. Especially since he kept getting distracted by the posters up on the wall. They were like the complete opposite of the kitten dangling from a branch with the word “Hang In There” in a comic font. One or two, he almost wanted to grab for a couple of the more emo kids from the community centre. They seemed like the kind of things they’d appreciate.  
他那些魁梧的保镖拖着他走——不，是拖着阿齐拉费尔走。这绝对比他在自己的身体里要费力得多。尤其是因为他总是被墙上的海报分散了注意力。它们完全与那只用漫画字体写着“坚持住”的树枝上晃动的小猫相反。有一两张，他几乎想从社区中心的一些更情绪化的孩子那里抢过来。它们似乎是他们会欣赏的东西。

Ahead of them, he vaguely registered Aziraphale’s name being mentioned and hastily forced himself to concentrate. If everything went well, he could always take one of the posters on the way back out.  
在他们前面，他模糊地听到了阿齐拉费尔的名字被提及，匆忙强迫自己集中注意力。如果一切顺利的话，他总可以在回去的路上拿一张海报。

“Bring in the traitor!” Beelzebub’s voice echoed off the walls.  
“把叛徒带进来！”贝尔撒巴的声音在墙壁间回荡。

His guards dragged him onwards and the hallway opened into a room which was, mercifully, as dark as the hallways. Twisted faces pressed against dark glassy walls, staring in at him. He really didn’t want to get a close look at the gnarled, horned shapes on the chairs that stood on a tiered dais. Plus his head was thumping. Hastur had given him one hell of a smack with something that felt like a crowbar and it definitely wasn’t helping.  
他的护卫将他拖向前方，走廊通向一个房间，幸运的是，这个房间和走廊一样黑暗。扭曲的面孔贴在黑暗而光滑的墙上，凝视着他。他真的不想近距离看那些坐在阶梯式讲台上的扭曲、有角的形状。而且他的头痛得厉害。哈斯特用像撬棍一样的东西狠狠地击中了他，这绝对没有帮助。

Still, he had one job to do and he was damned well going to do it.  
然而，他还有一项任务要完成，他一定会把它做好。

“Darlings!” He flashed Aziraphale’s widest, wickedest smile at them and held up his tightly-bound wrists. “I wondered when I could win you over to the joys of bondage.”  
“亲爱的！”他向阿齐拉费尔展示了他最灿烂、最邪恶的笑容，并举起了被紧紧捆绑的手腕。“我想知道什么时候我能让你们体验到束缚的乐趣。”

One of the three demons in front of him made a choked sound of revulsion. Ah, Crowley thought, peering at him. That would be Hastur then. Aziraphale had been adamant that Hastur was the easiest target of the lot. For a demon, Aziraphale said, Hastur was surprisingly straight-laced.  
他面前的三个恶魔中的一个发出了一声厌恶的咽喉声。啊，克劳利想着，凝视着他。那个应该就是哈斯特了。亚齐拉费尔坚称哈斯特是他们中最容易对付的目标。亚齐拉费尔说，对于一个恶魔来说，哈斯特出奇地拘谨。

“And a dungeon as well?” He widened his eyes, recalling all the ways Aziraphale played the flirtatious fiend card. “Is it my birthday?”  
"还有一个地牢吗？"他瞪大了眼睛，回想起亚齐拉费尔玩弄妖媚恶魔的种种方式。“难道今天是我的生日？”

“Silence!” Beelzebub snarled. They were slouched in the middle of the… chairs? Thrones? Big pile of spikes? Honestly, it was really very hard to tell with a throbbing head ache and such bad lighting. “The prisoner will approach!”  
“安静！”贝尔撒巴尔咆哮道。他们懒散地坐在中间……椅子？王座？一大堆尖刺？老实说，头痛难忍，光线又太差，真的很难说清楚。“囚犯请上前！”

Crowley walked forwards. Technically, logically, he should probably be afraid. I mean he _was_ in Hell, wasn’t he? Shouldn’t any good angel be afraid in Hell? Or, perhaps that itself is the answer: any angel might be afraid, but a _good_ angel would know better.  
克劳利向前走去。从技术上讲，从逻辑上讲，他应该害怕才对。我是说，他毕竟在地狱里，不是吗？在地狱里，任何善良的天使都应该害怕吧？或许，这本身就是答案：任何天使都可能害怕，但一个善良的天使会更明白其中的道理。

Crowley glanced at the three other faces as soon as he was close enough to see them. Beelzebub, of course, and Hastur and… he wanted to say Dagon? “So what’s all this full really about, my dears?” He gave his bound hands a demonstrative wiggle, flexing his fingers. “Don’t you think this is a little unnecessary?”  
克劳利走近三张脸时，他立刻瞥了一眼。当然有贝利亚尔，还有哈斯图尔和……他想说达贡？“那么，亲爱的，这到底是怎么回事？”他用被绑住的双手做了个示范性的摇晃，伸展了一下手指。“你们不觉得这有点不必要吗？”

Beelzebub didn’t sound impressed. “Not for the trial of a traitor.”  
贝尔芬巴不太满意地说道：“这可不适合审判一个叛徒。”

Crowley recalled the airfield and the petulant look on his demon’s face. “Oh, that again?” He shook his head. “That _really_ isn’t very nice.” He looked the Lord of Hell up and down. “Lord Beelzebub, you are…?”  
克劳利回想起飞机场和他的恶魔脸上的坏脾气表情。“哦，又来了？”他摇了摇头。“这真的不太好。”他上下打量着地狱之主。“比利泽布，你是……？”

They gave him a condescending look. “I’m the judge.”  
他们用一种居高临下的眼神看着他。“我是法官。”

“And I,” Hastur said, looking too satisfied with the arrangement, “am the prosecutor.”  
“而我，”哈斯特说道，看起来对这个安排非常满意，“就是检察官。”

Crowley glanced sidelong at the third demon. “So you’ll be defending me, then, my dear?”  
克劳利斜眼看了看第三只恶魔。“那么，亲爱的，你会为我辩护吗？”

Dagon grinned, showing sharp teeth. “Oh, I’m afraid not. I’m just here in case there’s anything you’ve done that they’ve forgotten.”  
达贡露出了尖牙，咧嘴一笑。“哦，恐怕不是这样。我只是在这里，以防你做了什么他们忘记的事情。”

“But we built this place for you specially,” Beelzebub said, leaning forward, setting flies swarming around their head. “It shall be your place of trial and it will be your place of destruction.”  
“但我们特意为你建造了这个地方，”贝利塞布说着，向前倾身，让苍蝇围绕着他们的头飞舞。“这将是你的审判之地，也将是你毁灭之地。”

Crowley looked around the bleak dungeon, water dripping from the ceiling, the surfaces grimy and filthy and remembered the bookshop. It was so warm and snug and _comfortable_, everything that this place wasn’t. “And not even _one_ cushion?” He sighed as if it was the end of the world – again – and clasped his hands in front of him. “Do you mind telling me what I’ve done?”  
克劳利环顾四周，阴冷的地牢里水滴从天花板滴落，表面沾满污垢和污秽，他想起了书店。那里是如此温暖、舒适，与这个地方截然不同。“连一个垫子都没有吗？”他叹了口气，仿佛世界末日一般，双手合十放在胸前。“你介意告诉我我做了什么吗？”

And so they told him.  
于是他们告诉了他。

To be entirely fair, they did have a number of very valid points. Aiding and abetting an angel in overthrowing Lucifer’s infernal plan was a biggie. And apparently – Crowley had to bite his lips to keep from sniggering – imprisoning Hastur in a ring of rosemary. Then there were the usual betrayals, treasons, general annoyances and incessant shameless flirting.  
说实话，他们确实有一些非常有道理的观点。帮助天使推翻鲁西弗的地狱计划是其中一个重要的观点。而且，克劳利不得不咬住嘴唇，以免笑出声来——用迷迭香困住哈斯特也是一个观点。然后还有一些常见的背叛、叛国、一般的烦恼和不断的无耻调情。

“And,” Hastur declared with the flourish of a magician revealing the right card, “the murderer of a fellow demon. A crime I saw with–”  
“而且，”哈斯特高声宣布，像是一位魔术师展示正确的牌一样，“还是一位同类恶魔的凶手。这是我亲眼目睹的罪行——”

“To be fair,” Crowley couldn’t help interrupting, “As I recall, you were there to actually…” He made a face and drew his fingers across his throat. “Self-defence has to count for something.”  
“公平地说，”克劳利情不自禁地插话道，“据我记得，你当时是去实际上……”他做了个鬼脸，用手指划过喉咙。“自卫总得有所考虑。”

The look on Beelzebub’s face said otherwise. “Creatures of Hell,” they called out. “You have heard the evidence against the demon known as Aziraphale. What is your verdict?”  
贝尔撒巴的表情告诉了另外一种故事。“地狱的生物们，”他们喊道。“你们听到了对于被称为阿齐拉费尔的恶魔的指控。你们的裁决是什么？”

The chants of “Guilty” from the peanut gallery were hardly surprising but for the first time, Crowley’s fuzzy, aching brain reminded him that if he hadn’t got himself here, then Aziraphale would have been standing right on this spot, facing this trial, condemnation and – no doubt – execution.   
“有罪！”花生看台上的喊声并不令人意外，但克劳利第一次意识到，如果不是他自己把自己弄到这里来，那么阿兹拉菲尔就会站在这个地方，面对这场审判、定罪，毫无疑问还有处决。

“Do you have anything to say,” Beelzebub said, gazing placidly at him, “before we take our vengeance on you?”  
“你有什么要说的吗？”贝尔撒巴问道，平静地凝视着他，“在我们对你进行报复之前？”

Lord, if they were wrong… if they’d misinterpreted… if they were maybe playing the wrong game with completely different pieces… if they’d taken a wild stab in the dark and ended up making things so much worse and– and– and–  
主啊，如果他们错了……如果他们误解了……如果他们可能在玩错误的游戏，用完全不同的棋子……如果他们胡乱猜测，结果让事情变得更糟糕，然后……然后……然后……

“What’s it to be?” He forced the question out before the thoughts could drown him. “An eternity in the deepest pit?”  
“怎么决定呢？”他在思绪淹没他之前强迫自己问出这个问题。“永远沉入最深的深渊？”

“Oh no,” Hastur breathed. “We’re going to do something even worse. Letting the punishment fit the crime.”  
“哦不，”哈斯特喘着气说道。“我们将要做一件更糟糕的事情。让惩罚与罪行相称。”

From the lobby beyond the dungeon, Crowley heard the ping of the lift and – along with every demon in the place – turned to watch the approaching glowing presence of something divine. His heart stuttered at the sight of not just any angel, but _Michael_.  
从地牢外的大厅里，克劳利听到电梯的叮咚声，然后和场内的每一个恶魔一起转身注视着那个逐渐靠近的神圣光芒。他的心在看到的不仅仅是一个天使，而是迈克尔时，一下子停了下来。

“Shit…” "糟糕…"

Dagon laughed maliciously. “Cooperation with our old enemies.”  
达贡恶狠狠地笑了起来。“与我们的老敌人合作。”

Of course, Crowley thought, fighting the desire to roll his eyes. Millennia at one another’s throats, but they could cooperate well enough when they wanted to smite people. But the one small relief was that he and Aziraphale _were right_. They had interpreted Agnes’s warning and they were _right_.  
当然，克劳利心想，他努力抑制住翻白眼的冲动。千年来彼此争斗，但当他们想要惩罚人类时，他们可以很好地合作。但唯一的安慰是，他和阿齐拉费尔是正确的。他们正确地解读了阿格尼丝的警告。

“Well, wank-wings,” Hastur said with surprising boldness for a demon to an Archangel, “You brought the stuff?”  
“嘿，混蛋翅膀，”哈斯图尔大胆地对一位大天使说道，“你带来东西了吗？”

Michael was too well-behaved to look angry, but Crowley could recognise the twitch of fury around their lips and the way their eyes narrowed just a little. “I did,” they said and – with considerable pettiness – offered a tall, fluted, open pitcher of water to Hastur. “I’ll be back to collect it.”  
迈克尔表现得太过老实，看不出他生气的样子，但克劳利能察觉到他嘴唇周围的愤怒抽搐和眼睛微微眯起的样子。“是的，我做到了，”他说着，带着相当的小气，将一只高大、有花纹的开口水罐递给哈斯特。“我会回来收回它的。”

Crowley had seen many impressive things in his time, but Hastur backpedalling as fast as his legs could carry him was impressive. “I think perhaps you ought to do the honours,” the demon babbled waving towards a bathtub which Crowley had not noticed until that moment. “I’ve seen what that stuff can do.”  
克劳利在他的生命中见过许多令人印象深刻的事情，但哈斯特尔以他的腿所能承受的速度后退，这真是令人印象深刻。“我想也许你应该来主持典礼，”恶魔喃喃自语着，指向一个克劳利在那一刻才注意到的浴缸。“我见过那东西能做什么。”

And Michael, in an attitude of gracious benevolence, loathing written in every line of their face, smiled and poured the crystal clear water into the tub.  When they were done, they looked at Crowley with a far darker smile.  
迈克尔以一种亲切慈祥的态度，脸上透露出厌恶的神情，微笑着将清澈透明的水倒入浴缸。完成后，他们用一种更加阴暗的微笑看着克劳利。

“That’s Holy Water,” he murmured. He didn’t have to check. He could feel it from a dozen paces.  
“那是圣水，”他低声说道。他不需要检查，他能从十步之外感受到它的存在。

Michael’s eyes glittered. “The Holiest.”  
迈克尔的眼睛闪烁着光芒。“至圣。”

“It’s not that we don’t trust you, Michael,” Beelzebub drawled, but obviously we don’t trust you. Hastur…” Crowley turned, startled, looking at the two demons as Michael walked away. “Test it.”  
“并不是我们不相信你，迈克尔，”贝利泽布慢悠悠地说道，但显然我们不相信你。哈斯特……”克劳利转过身，吃惊地看着这两个恶魔，而迈克尔则离开了。“测试一下吧。”

Test it? When it was– Yeah, technically you could test it, but if you did, you’d be risking your own life. A single drop was enough to– but surely they wouldn’t do that to make a point and–  
测试它？当它发生时，是的，从技术上讲你可以测试它，但如果你这样做，你将冒着生命危险。只需一滴就足够了，但他们肯定不会这样做来表达一个观点和-

And under his horrified gaze, Hastur casually yanked the small demon usher off the floor. It begged and pleaded, but Hastur just threw him into the tub. The demons beyond the glass recoiled as hard as Crowley did, as the usher screamed and wailed and bubbled and dissolved and was gone as if he had never existed.  
在他恐惧的目光下，哈斯特毫不在意地将小恶魔拽起来。它乞求着，但哈斯特只是将它扔进了浴缸。玻璃后面的恶魔们像克劳利一样退缩，而招待员尖叫着、哀嚎着、冒泡着、溶解着，就像它从未存在过一样，消失不见了。

Oh Lord… 哦，主啊…

That… 那个..

That was what they had intended for Aziraphale. They would have done _that_ to him. Yeah, logically, they’d reasoned this was what would happen, but to _see_ it, to _know_…  
那就是他们对亚齐拉费尔的本意。他们本来会这样对待他的。是的，从逻辑上讲，他们推理出这将会发生，但亲眼目睹，心知肚明...

“Jesus…” he breathed, squeezing his hands tightly together.  
“耶稣……”他喃喃自语，紧紧地握紧双手。

“Demon Aziraphale,” Beelzebub said impatiently, as though they hadn’t just murdered one of their own. Crowley turned, shaken, to stare at them. “I sentence you to extinction by Holy Water.” They gave him a disdainful look. “Have you anything to say?”  
“阿齐拉费尔恶魔，”贝利尔不耐烦地说道，仿佛他们刚刚没有杀死自己人一样。克劳利转过身来，心神不宁地盯着他们。“我判你以圣水灭绝。”他们不屑地看了他一眼。“你有什么要说的吗？”

Crowley stared at them. 克劳利盯着他们。

They would have killed Aziraphale. They would have brought him, bound and friendless, to this place. They would have condemned him and when they were done, they would have forced him into that water and watched with indifference as he _died_.  
他们本来会杀死阿齐拉费尔。他们本来会把他带到这个地方，束缚他、使他孤立无援。他们本来会判他有罪，等他们完成后，他们本来会强迫他进入那水中，并冷漠地看着他死去。

“Actually, my dear,” he said, smiling with a devil’s smile that was all his own, “do you mind if I… take a few things off.” He dragged his fingers sensually down the front of his coat and shirt, admiring the way Hastur’s face twisted in distaste. “I’d hate to ruin my favourite jacket when you… get me wet.”  
“其实，亲爱的，”他笑着说，露出了他独有的邪恶笑容，“你介意我……脱掉一些东西吗。”他性感地将手指沿着大衣和衬衫的前襟滑下，欣赏着哈斯图尔脸上扭曲的厌恶表情。“当你……弄湿我时，我可不想弄脏我最喜欢的夹克。”

“You don’t get this view down in the basement.”  
在地下室可看不到这个景色。

Aziraphale didn’t even bother to turn, certainly not wanting to give Gabriel or the other angels in attendance the satisfaction. He had watched them arrange well-warded stones in a circle and when he had asked, Uriel had answered with one cryptic word: barbecue.  
亚齐拉费尔甚至懒得转身，当然不想给加百列或其他在场的天使们满足感。他看着他们把防护良好的石头排成一个圆圈，当他问起时，乌列尔只回答了一个神秘的词：烧烤。

It was always so… lovely to be right in one’s assumptions.  
总是这样...在自己的假设中是多么美好。

Anyway, he recognised that voice well enough. A charming little demon. Some called him Eric. Others called him Legion. Either way, he reproduced like bunnies and even occasionally looked like one, with wispy black fluffy ears.  
无论如何，他对那个声音非常熟悉。一个迷人的小恶魔。有人称他为埃里克，有人称他为军团。无论哪种方式，他繁殖得像兔子一样，甚至偶尔还会长得像兔子，带着蓬松的黑色耳朵。

He was also one of the sweetest and most harmless demons Hell had ever produced. On one particularly memorable occasion, he had hugged Aziraphale and cried into his waistcoat because “selfies, mate. Genius! Just _genius_!”  
他也是地狱曾经产生过的最甜美、最无害的恶魔之一。在一次特别难忘的场合，他拥抱着阿齐拉费尔，哭泣着埋在他的背心里，因为“自拍，伙计。天才！真是太天才了！”

He wandered past the chair and Aziraphale to a circle of stones laid out for the purpose, and oh, it was so satisfying to know that Heaven and Hell’s hypocrisy knew no limits as little Eric, charged them with a blast of fire. The flames spiralled up in a column that licked at the ceiling, the scent of it like sulphur.  
他漫步经过椅子和阿齐拉费尔，来到一个为此目的而布置的石头圈子，哦，知道天堂和地狱的伪善是无止境的，真是让人心满意足。小埃里克向他们发射了一道火焰，火焰螺旋般地升腾而起，舔舐着天花板，散发着硫磺的气味。

The angels all stayed well back from it, looking unsurprisingly uncomfortable and tense. It _was_ Hellfire, after all. Aziraphale could tell from the deep colours dancing at the heart of the flames and the pleasant prickle of its heat against his skin.  
天使们都远远地站在一边，看起来毫不意外地感到不舒服和紧张。毕竟，那是地狱之火。亚齐拉费尔从火焰中心跳动的深色和炙热的温度感觉，就能判断出来。

“So,” Gabriel said, over the hiss and snap of the fire, “with one act of treason, you averted the war.”  
“所以，”加布里埃尔在火焰的嘶嘶声和啪啪声中说道，“通过一次叛逆的行为，你避免了战争。”

Aziraphale met his gaze with a smile. “Well, I like to think it was for the greater good of humani–”  
亚齐拉费尔微笑着与他对视。“嗯，我想这是为了人类的大好。”

Gabriel’s face twisted into something that looked far, far too demonic for the ethereal planes of Heaven. “Don’t talk to me about the greater good, sunshine,” he snapped. “I’m the Archangel fucking Gabriel.”  
加百列的脸扭曲成了一种在天堂那超凡的位面上看起来极度恶魔化的样子。“别跟我谈什么更大的利益，太阳光。”他厉声说道。“我可是大天使加百列。”

And there you are, my dear, Aziraphale thought darkly. Not any better than the rest of us.  
亲爱的，阿齐拉费尔心中阴暗地想道，你就在那里，和我们其他人一样糟糕。

“The greater good was we were finally going to settle things with the opposition once and for all!” Gabriel continued, his violet eyes flashing.  
“为了更大的利益，我们终于要彻底解决与反对派的问题了！”加布里埃尔继续说道，他的紫色眼睛闪烁着。

Aziraphale schooled his expression. Opposition, indeed. Who had kidnapped one of their own? Who had condemned one of their own? Who had terrorised and threatened and bullied and exiled one of their own for millennia when all that poor angel had done was his job?  
亚齐拉费尔控制住了自己的表情。反对？真的吗？谁绑架了他们中的一员？谁谴责了他们中的一员？谁恐吓、威胁、欺凌并放逐了他们中的一员，而那个可怜的天使所做的只是他的工作？

No such thing as opposition.  
没有所谓的反对。

Two sides of the same damned coin and both as brutal and cruel as one another.  
同一枚该死硬币的两面，同样残酷无情。

Uriel stalked across the floor and whipped the cords from Aziraphale’s wrists. “Up,” they snarled.  
乌里尔怒气冲冲地走过地板，将阿齐拉费尔手腕上的绳子解开。“起来，”他们咆哮道。

Aziraphale rose at once, massaging his wrists, then smoothed down Crowley’s t-shirt. It was the one he’d bought for him, oh, three, four years ago. The humans had started gifting them to the angel and Aziraphale couldn’t resist getting in on the act. The fact it declared “Don’t be a prick” in bright yellow letters only made him like it more.  
亚齐拉费尔立刻站起身来，揉了揉手腕，然后整理了一下克劳利的T恤。这是他三四年前给他买的那件。人类开始送天使礼物，亚齐拉费尔也忍不住加入其中。上面用鲜黄色的字母写着“别做刺头”，这让他更喜欢它。

“Any chance I can change your mind?” he inquired, knowing full well that Crowley wouldn’t have been able to help himself, not when it came to questioning their actions. The little darling did it all the time, even when he ought not to have. “We’re _meant_ to be the good guys, for Heaven’s sake!”  
“有没有可能我能改变你的想法？”他询问道，心知肚明克劳利在质疑他们的行动时是无法自拔的。这个可爱的家伙总是这样做，即使他不应该这样做。“我们本来就是为了善良而存在的，天啊！”

“Well, for _Heaven’s_ sake, we’re meant to make examples of traitors.” Gabriel’s voice was cold and hard. “You’ve gotten away with your misbehaviour for far too long already, Raziel. So…” He gestured to the column of fire with a chilly smile. “Into the flame.”  
“唉，天哪，我们应该以叛徒为例。”加百列的声音冷酷而坚定。“拉齐尔，你的不端行为已经得逞太久了。所以……”他带着冷冽的微笑指向火柱。“进入火焰吧。”

Aziraphale approached the ring of stones, slowly curling and uncurling his hands. The pretence had to be maintained. Taking that beautiful ribbon of fire, gathering it up and turning it against them to scour them from the planes of Heaven was so very _very_ tempting. No one would miss them, of that he was certain, but he had _promised_ Crowley that no one would be harmed and for Crowley, that was one vow he would keep.  
亚齐拉费尔缓缓走近石环，手指轻轻地握紧又松开。他必须维持住伪装。将那美丽的火焰之带捧起，转而用它来清除他们，从天堂的位面上抹去他们，这个诱惑实在是太太太大了。他确信没有人会想念他们，但他曾向克劳利承诺不会伤害任何人，对于克劳利来说，这是他必须遵守的誓言。

He looked at them, giving them the last privilege of Crowley’s merciful smile. “It’s been nice knowing you.” He smiled a little wider, hooking his thumbs into the pockets of Crowley’s jeans, as the angel so often did when he was being self-effacing. “We should have drinks some time. Y’know. For old time’s sake.”  
他看着他们，给予他们克劳利最后一次仁慈的微笑。"认识你们真是太好了。"他微笑得更宽了一点，把双手的拇指钩进克劳利牛仔裤的口袋里，就像天使经常在自谦时那样。"我们应该有机会喝一杯。你懂的，为了过去的时光。"

Gabriel’s eyes flashed purple fire. “Shut your stupid mouth and die already.”  
加布里埃尔的眼睛闪烁着紫色的火焰。“闭上你那愚蠢的嘴巴，早点去死吧。”

_Oh why did you make me promise, darling? Why? It would be so_ easy_._  
哦，亲爱的，你为什么让我答应呢？为什么？这本来是件很容易的事情。

Aziraphale could feel Crowley’s smile wavering on his lips. He looked back at the flames and stepped forward.  
亚齐拉费尔能感觉到克劳利的微笑在他的嘴唇上动摇。他回头看着火焰，向前迈出一步。

People were screaming. 人们尖叫着。

It was hilarious. 太搞笑了。

Crowley always liked to think of himself a decent person, if a somewhat morally-shaky angel, but he had to admit he was having a whale of a time.  
克劳利总是喜欢认为自己是个体面的人，虽然是个道德有些摇摆的天使，但他不得不承认他玩得非常开心。

Hastur looked like he’d swallowed his own tongue, while Beelzebub had recoiled so far back on their throne that they’d pulled their feet up onto the seat and Dagon was practically hiding behind it, terror all over their face.  
哈斯特尔看起来像是吞下了自己的舌头，而贝利泽布尔则在他们的王座上退缩得如此之远，以至于他们把脚收到了座位上，达贡几乎躲在后面，脸上充满了恐惧。

Crowley took a breath and slid right under the water again, kicking up great splashes of the stuff that hissed and popped as he broke back through the surface. “Ah, lovely!” He shook his head, sending water drops flying and demons flailing backwards away from him. “You ought to try this, my dears! It’s delightful!”  
克劳利深吸一口气，再次滑入水中，激起一片巨大的水花，当他再次冒出水面时，水花嘶嘶作响。"啊，太美妙了！"他摇了摇头，水滴四溅，恶魔们被他击退。"亲爱的们，你们应该试试这个！太令人愉快了！"

“H-he’s gone native,” Beelzebub’s voice reached him. “He’s not one of us anymore.”  
“他...他变土著了，”贝利泽布的声音传到他耳边。“他不再是我们中的一员了。”

The Hellfire was like stepping into a refreshing bath after the astringent sting of Heaven’s sterility and Aziraphale sighed with satisfaction, stretching his arms and rolling his head on his shoulders.  
地狱火就像是在天堂的荒凉和刺鼻的气息之后，踏入一池清凉的浴水，亚齐拉费尔满意地叹了口气，伸展双臂，转动着脖子。

Beyond the wavering heat of the flames, he could see the blind terror on the face of the angels and wrinkled his nose when he grinned at them.  
在摇曳的火焰中，他能看到天使脸上的盲目恐惧，当他朝他们咧嘴一笑时，他皱了皱鼻子。

Well, he thought, he had only promised not to _harm_ them. No one said anything about not scaring the living daylights out of them.  
嗯，他想，他只是答应不伤害他们。没人说过不能把他们吓得魂飞魄散。

He brought one hand to his lips and blew a flourishing kiss in their direction, gouting a torrent of flame out towards them, and burst out laughing when they skipped frantically backwards. Gabriel and Sandalphon practically leapt into one another’s arms in their panic.  
他将一只手放在嘴唇上，朝他们的方向吹了一个夸张的飞吻，喷出一股火焰冲向他们，当他们惊慌地向后跳时，他大笑起来。加百列和桑达尔芬几乎在恐慌中互相扑入了对方的怀抱。

“It may be worse than we thought,” the Archangel said unsteadily.  
“可能比我们想象的更糟糕，”大天使颤抖地说道。

“Wh-what is he?” Uriel demanded, backing away.  
“他是什么东西？”乌里尔要求，退后了一步。

And oh, even if they weren’t maimed or wounded or as dead as he would have liked, the sheer confusion and fear in their faces – something they would never ever forget too – was almost worth it, and he smiled.  
哦，即使他们没有受伤或受到他期望的那样严重的伤害，他们脸上的混乱和恐惧——这是他们永远不会忘记的东西——几乎是值得的，他微笑了。

Raziel of the Book, he thought happily, now and forever your worst nightmare.  
书中的拉齐尔，他心里快乐地想着，现在和永远都是你最可怕的噩梦。

“It’s a funny thing, you know,” Crowley said, sprawling back in the tub and kicking at the water with one foot, “but this?” He turned Aziraphale’s widest and most malicious grin on them. “This is only a glimpse of what I can do. You have _no_ _idea_ what else I’ve been learning. So many… useful, special little tricks.” He draped himself along the side of the tub. “And who knows? Maybe I’ll share them with you. I’m a very…” – his lips twitched – “giving person.”  
“你知道吗，这真是个有趣的事情。”克劳利一边懒散地躺在浴缸里，一只脚在水中踢着，“但这个？”他把阿齐拉费尔最宽厉、最恶毒的笑容投射给他们。“这只是我能做到的一小部分。你们根本不知道我还学到了什么。有那么多…有用的、特别的小技巧。”他沿着浴缸的边缘舒展开来。“而且谁知道呢？也许我会与你们分享。我是个非常…”- 他的嘴唇抽动了一下 - “慷慨的人。”

“He’s bluffing!” Hastur exclaimed, a very bold claim coming from a demon who was quite literally watching his worst enemy enjoying a very splashy bath. “We can take him. One demon against the rest of Hell? What’s he gonna–”  
“他在虚张声势！”哈斯图尔大声喊道，这是一个非常大胆的说法，来自一个实际上正在看着他最大的敌人洗着非常豪华的澡的恶魔。“我们可以对付他。一个恶魔对抗地狱的其他所有人？他能做什么——”

“Shut it!” Beelzebub snarled. “Get him out of here! He’ll cause a riot!”  
“闭嘴！”贝尔撒巴尔咆哮道。“把他赶出去！他会引发骚乱的！”

Crowley gave them a cheerful little wave, waggling his fingers. “Good call, Lord B.”  
克劳利开心地向他们挥了挥手，摇晃着手指。“干得漂亮，B大人。”

They ignored him, glaring beyond him at the demons in the peanut gallery. “What are you all looking at? Nothing to see! Nothing to see here!” A gesture from their hand blackened the glass, blotting out the view.  
他们无视了他，怒视着他身后的恶魔们。“你们都在看什么？没什么好看的！这里没什么好看的！”他们挥手一下，玻璃变黑，遮住了视线。

From the lobby, there was a ping of the lift and Crowley grinned, sloshing his way around in the tub.  
从大厅传来了电梯的叮咚声，克劳利笑了笑，一边在浴缸里溅水。

Scaring demons was one thing, but he threw his arms wide and beamed as Michael walked into the room and stopped dead, colour draining from their face. “Michael! You beautiful darling! I don’t suppose you could miracle me up a towel?”  
吓唬恶魔是一回事，但他张开双臂，笑容满面地迎接迈克尔走进房间，而迈克尔却突然停住了，脸色变得苍白无血。“迈克尔！你这个美丽的亲爱的！我不知道你是否能给我神奇地找一条毛巾？”

Michael’s throat bobbed frantically, eyes wide, lips flapping as if they wanted to say something. Instead, a shaking hand produced and held out a towel at arm’s length.  
迈克尔的喉咙疯狂地上下移动，眼睛睁得大大的，嘴唇不停地翕动，仿佛想要说些什么。然而，一只颤抖的手拿出一条毛巾，伸直了手臂将其递了出来。

Yeah, you condescending bastard, Crowley thought happily, look at you with your preconceptions challenged. No more black and white world views for you.  
克劳利心里愉快地想道：“是啊，你这个自以为是的混蛋，看看你的成见被挑战了吧。再也没有黑白分明的世界观适合你了。”

He stood up in the tub, sweeping the towel around his bare shoulders like a cape. “One more thing, my dears,” he said, stepping delicately out of the tub, making sure to send a cascade of water sloshing across the floor. “I think it would be better for everyone if I was left alone for the foreseeable future, don’t you?”  
他站在浴缸里，用毛巾围在赤裸的肩膀上，就像披着披风一样。"还有一件事，亲爱的们，"他说着，小心翼翼地从浴缸里踏出来，确保水花溅到地板上。"我想，如果将来的日子里我能独自一人，对大家来说会更好，不是吗？"

He looked from face to terrified face as he casually towelled his hair dry, smiling as each of them nodded. Even Michael looked like they wanted to turn and run for the door as they nodded. Crowley beamed at them. “Jolly good.”  
他随意地用毛巾擦干头发，从一个个惊恐的脸上扫视过去，每个人点头时他都微笑着。即使是迈克尔也看起来想转身逃离门口，但还是点了点头。克劳利对他们笑容满面地说道：“太好了。”

A demon and an angel met, not for the first time, in Berkeley Square.  
一只恶魔和一位天使在伯克利广场相遇，这并不是他们第一次见面。

Crowley sprawled down onto the bench with a relieved sigh, loose-limbed as a lazy cat. Aziraphale watched him with amusement.  
克劳利松了口气，舒服地一屁股坐在长椅上，像只懒洋洋的猫一样。阿齐拉费尔笑着看着他。

“Do I always look like that?”  
我总是看起来这样吗？

One blue eye cracked open. “Lazy and just a little bit slutty? Yep.”  
一只蓝眼睛微微睁开。“懒散而有点放荡？没错。”

Aziraphale tilted his head, brown eyes running the full length of his own body. “I look rather good, I must say.”  
亚齐拉费尔歪着头，棕色的眼睛从头到脚扫视了一遍自己的身体。“我得说，我看起来相当不错。”

“Oh, shut up,” Crowley laughed. “You’re not getting to enjoy… yourself.” His lips curled and _Lord_, Aziraphale thought, _do I look quite as temptingly obscene when I make that face_? The angel’s irrepressible grin returned. “I know you were thinking it, you dirty bugger.”  
“哦，闭嘴吧，”克劳利笑着说道。“你可没机会好好……享受自己。”他的嘴角勾起，天哪，亚齐拉费尔想，我做出这个表情时，会不会看起来像是那么诱人下流呢？天使无法抑制的笑容又回来了。“我知道你在想什么，你这个下流家伙。”

Of all the people capable of rendering a blush on his face, Aziraphale had to admit he’d never expected it of Crowley. “Well, it _is_ something that I never imagined was possible,” he said as primly as he could. “Can you blame me for wondering?”  
在所有能让他脸红的人中，亚齐拉费尔必须承认他从未预料到克劳利会这样做。“嗯，这是我从未想过可能发生的事情，”他尽可能地端庄地说道。“你能怪我好奇吗？”

The angel in his body laughed, letting his head roll back against the bench.  
他体内的天使笑了起来，让他的头往后靠在长凳上。

“Not to detract from such a… lovely spectacle,” Aziraphale said, forcing himself to look away, “but do you think they’ll leave us alone now?”  
“不是为了贬低这样一个……美丽的景象，”亚齐拉费尔说着，强迫自己移开目光，“但你觉得他们现在会离开我们吗？”

Crowley gazed skywards. “I think so. For a bit anyway. We’re unstable elements. You don’t want to poke at unstable elements too hard, because you don’t know when they’re going to blow up in your face.”  
克劳利仰望着天空。“我想是的。至少暂时是这样。我们是不稳定的因素。你不想过分刺激不稳定的因素，因为你不知道它们什么时候会爆炸在你的脸上。”

Aziraphale nodded pensively. “They did look a little worried.” He slanted another glance, altogether too fascinated by Crowley’s quietly contented smile on his own lips. Perhaps it was a little narcissistic, but it was awfully tempting. “We ought to change back, I think.”  
亚齐拉费尔若有所思地点了点头。“他们看起来有点担心。”他斜了一眼，对克劳利嘴角上那安静满足的微笑感到过于着迷。也许有点自恋，但实在太诱人了。“我想我们应该换回去。”

One blue eye slid open, a glint of white showing at Crowley’s lip. “Getting hot and bothered, are you?”  
一只蓝眼睁开，克劳利的嘴唇露出一丝白色的闪光。“你是不是有点热衷起来了？”

Aziraphale pouted at him. “You’re a terribly cruel person, darling.”  
亚齐拉费尔皱着眉头看着他。“亲爱的，你真是个可怕的人。”

The smile that spread on his face was purely angelic and Crowley shone through. It was utterly dazzling. “I’ll restrain myself,” he said, offering his hand.  
他脸上绽放出的微笑纯粹如天使般，克劳利的光芒闪耀而出。简直令人眩目。“我会克制自己的”，他说着，伸出了手。

Aziraphale threaded his fingers between Crowley’s at once and felt the whisper of the angel’s power through him. Lord, Crowley could have laid the other angels to waste if he had ever been so inclined. The warm soft hand around his became thinner and more callused and Crowley squeezed his fingers before letting go.  
亚齐拉费尔立刻将手指与克劳利的手紧紧相握，感受到天使力量的低语。天哪，如果克劳利曾有意如此，他本可以将其他天使一网打尽。他的手变得温暖而柔软，但也变得更加粗糙，克劳利紧握着他的手指，然后松开。

The demon glanced down at himself, then looked at Crowley. The angel was combing his fingers through his hair, arranging it into the style most people would regard as pulled-backwards-through-a-hedge, coppery tufts gleaming in the sunlight.  “Taking issue with my styling?  
恶魔低头看了看自己，然后看向克劳利。天使正在用手指梳理着自己的头发，将它整理成大多数人会认为是从树篱中往后拉过去的样式，铜色的卷发在阳光下闪闪发光。“对我的发型有意见吗？

Crowley wrinkled his nose. “You made it look sad.”  
克劳利皱了皱鼻子。“你让它看起来很伤心。”

“Sad.” Aziraphale echoed, lips twitching. “Of course. I beg your pardon.”  
“伤心。”亚齐拉费尔回应道，嘴角微微抽动。“当然。请原谅我。”

One satisfied, Crowley settled back on the bench. “Y’know, it was as easy as you said.” He nudged Aziraphale. “I told them I was so pleased they were trying out bondage with me. I swear Hastur croaked like a frog.”  
满意地，克劳利在长凳上舒服地坐下。“你知道吗，就像你说的那样，这真的很容易。”他轻轻推了推阿齐拉费尔。“我告诉他们我很高兴他们和我一起尝试束缚。我发誓哈斯特尔像青蛙一样咕咕叫了起来。”

“You didn’t!” "你没做吧！"

“Mm.” Crowley’s dark eyes danced. “And told them off for their lack of cushions in the sex dungeon. And that’s before they… got me wet.”  
“嗯。”克劳利的深邃眼眸闪烁着光芒。“还训斥他们在性奴隶地牢里没有足够的垫子。而且这还只是在他们……弄湿了我之前。”

Aziraphale burst out laughing. “Oh you…” He shook his head admiringly. “I have no idea _what_ you are, my darling, but I like it very much.”  
亚齐拉费尔哈哈大笑起来。“哦，你……”他赞赏地摇了摇头。“我不知道你是什么，亲爱的，但我非常喜欢。”

To his utter satisfaction, the angel actually blushed. “Yeah?”  
令他非常满意的是，天使竟然脸红了。“是吗？”

“Mm.” Aziraphale leaned closer, lowering his voice to a purr. “Considerably.”  
“嗯。”亚齐拉费尔靠近一些，声音低沉得像一只猫咕噜着说道。“相当多。”

Crowley gazed at him, wonder and happiness all over his face. He ducked his head, then knocked Aziraphale’s elbow with his own. “Want to go for lunch? I could grab us a table at the Ritz.”  
克劳利凝视着他，脸上洋溢着惊奇和幸福。他低下头，然后用自己的胳膊碰了碰阿齐拉费尔的胳膊。“想去吃午餐吗？我可以在丽兹酒店给我们订个桌子。”

Aziraphale threaded his fingers between Crowley’s again. “Darling,” he said, squeezing the angel’s hand. “I would _love_ to.”  
亚齐拉费尔再次将手指与克劳利紧紧相扣。“亲爱的，”他说着，握紧了天使的手。“我很愿意。”
