---

Armageddon has passed, Adam lived happily with his oblivious parents, the Them adopted Warlock into their clique, the rest of the world has conveniently forgotten all the weird phenomenons that occurred within the past month, and Aziraphale and Crowley have bought a small cottage out in South Downs. If Aziraphale compared their lives to a novel, he would say it has reached its conclusion.   
世界末日已经过去，亚当与他毫不知情的父母过上了幸福的生活，他们把沃洛克收入了自己的圈子，而其他人则方便地忘记了过去一个月发生的所有奇怪现象。阿齐拉费尔和克劳利在南唐斯买了一间小屋。如果阿齐拉费尔把他们的生活比作一本小说，他会说这已经是结局了。

The only loose end he would draw up is that Heaven and Hell would inevitably be back. Their little parlor trick would only placate the two sides for so long until they tried again. At least it gave them time to figure out what to do next time.  
他唯一要解决的问题是，天堂和地狱注定会回来。他们的小把戏只能暂时安抚双方，直到他们再次尝试。至少这给了他们时间来想出下一步该怎么做。

But right now, Aziraphale was more focused on packing up his books.   
但此刻，阿齐拉费尔更专注于整理他的书籍。

The bookstore looked more barren than it had since Aziraphale first bought it over a hundred years ago. Half of the bookshelves were already miracled back at the cottage and their contents stood in a tall wall of boxes by the door. Crowley would be there any second with the Bentley after spending yesterday carefully transporting each plant in the narrow backseat. Much like Aziraphale, it felt more respectful to his plants to personally transport them instead of miracle them in place.   
自从亚齐拉费尔一百多年前买下这家书店以来，它看起来比以往任何时候都要荒凉。一半的书架已经被奇迹般地送回了小屋，它们的内容摆放在门口的一堵高高的箱子墙前。克劳利将在几秒钟后开着宾利来到这里，昨天他小心翼翼地将每一株植物都运送到了狭窄的后座上。与亚齐拉费尔一样，亲自运送植物给他们更多的尊重，而不是通过奇迹将它们放置在原地。

Aziraphale had packed up most of his belongings, opting to leave behind just a few pieces of furniture that wouldn’t fit in their little cottage. One of these items was the circular rug he kept in the center of the room, hiding the call circle to Heaven. He would have to erase the markings before selling the shop, but he decided to leave that for last. Like cutting his final ties to Above.   
亚齐拉费尔已经收拾好了大部分的物品，只留下了一些无法放进小屋的家具。其中一个物品是他放在房间中央的圆形地毯，它隐藏了通往天堂的召唤圈。在出售店铺之前，他得抹去上面的标记，但他决定把这件事留到最后。就像切断与上界的最后联系。

There was only one shelf left with a full inventory of books, and Aziraphale carefully stacked them in one of the boxes. He would hold each book for a lingering moment, recalling how many times he’s flipped open their pages, before setting it down and moving on to the next one. He was in the middle of the second shelf when there was a sudden crackle in the air, like static making his hair stand on end, followed by a _crack!_ . The lights flickered and darkened, not only in the bookshop, but on down the street. Aziraphale heard the resounding sound of a heavy object hitting the floor, until he snapped his fingers and the lights came on again.   
只剩下一排书架上还有满满一箱书，亚齐拉费尔小心地把它们堆放进其中一只箱子里。他会把每本书都拿在手里停留片刻，回忆起自己翻开它们页页的次数，然后放下并继续下一本。当他正在处理第二排书架时，突然空气中传来一阵噼啪声，就像静电让他的头发竖起来一样，接着是一声砰！灯光闪烁并变暗，不仅是书店里，整条街上的灯光都暗了下来。亚齐拉费尔听到沉重物体撞击地板的声音，直到他弹了弹手指，灯光又亮了起来。

He found he had collapsed to one knee out of shock, so Aziraphale stood and surveyed the damage. The bookshop was relatively the same; except that, in the middle of the summoning circle, laid an unfamiliar - yet eerily familiar - body. A tall, lanky figure dressed in fine pink-and-white clothes was draped across the angelic runes. For the moment, they appeared stunned or knocked unconscious, but then the figure twitched and began to move.   
他发现自己因为震惊而跪倒在地，于是亚齐拉费尔站起来，审视着周围的破坏。书店基本上还是一样的，只是在召唤阵中央，躺着一个陌生却又怪异熟悉的身影。一个身穿精致的粉白色衣服的高个子瘦削人物横卧在天使符文上。暂时看起来他们似乎被震慑或昏迷了，但随后那个人物抽搐了一下，开始动了起来。

Fearing a trick from Heaven, Aziraphale donned the only weapon he had available: _Jane Eyre_ by Charlotte Brönte _,_ an original 1847 copy signed by the sisters. If he was less frazzled, he might have chosen the much thicker textbook on the history of Europe on the shelf just below Brönte’s classic (with many written notes in the margins correcting the text).  
为了防备上天的诡计，阿齐拉费尔戴上了他唯一能够使用的武器：夏洛蒂·勃朗特的《简·爱》。这是一本1847年的原版，由勃朗特姐妹亲笔签名。如果他不那么疲惫不堪，他可能会选择书架下面那本更厚的欧洲历史教科书（书页上有很多写在边缘的笔记，纠正了文本的错误）。

“Reveal yourself!” He threatened, holding _Jane Eyre_ above his head. “You are in the presence of a Principality, Guardian of the Eastern Gate—!”  
“现身吧！”他威胁道，将《简·爱》高举过头顶。“你正置身于一个王国的面前，东方之门的守护者——！”

“And you are in the presence of an Archangel, so I’d much rather if you put that down.” The figure stood, fixing his sleeves and placing a pair of pink tinted glasses on his nose, and Aziraphale gaped.   
"而且你现在正面对一位大天使，所以我更希望你放下那个东西。”那个身影站起来，整理了一下袖子，戴上了一副粉色调的眼镜，阿齐拉费尔目瞪口呆。

It was Crowley, but most definitely not _his_ Crowley. This was an angel, the divine energy surrounding him unmistakable. A powerful angel. An—  
这是克劳利，但绝对不是他的克劳利。这是一个天使，他身上散发着明显的神圣能量。一个强大的天使。一个——

“Archangel?” Aziraphale repeated.   
“大天使？”亚齐拉费尔重复道。

This Not-Crowley froze upon finally looking up, scanning Aziraphale up and down with naked disbelief. “Azirafell?”  
这个不是克劳利终于抬头看着阿齐拉费尔，用赤裸的不信任感上下打量着他。"阿齐拉费尔？"

There was something off about the way Not-Crowley said his name. “Azira _phale_ , actually. Um...how…?”  
Not-Crowley说他的名字的方式有点奇怪。“实际上是Azira phale。嗯...怎么...？”

Not-Crowley shook his head and crossed his arms, guarded even when blessed from Above. “The Antichrist. He must be coming into his power if there’s portals opening up to other dimensions.”  
Not-Crowley摇了摇头，双臂交叉，即使受到上天的祝福，他仍然保持警惕。“那个反基督者。如果有通往其他维度的门户打开，那他一定正在发挥他的力量。”

“Adam can do that?” Aziraphale wondered aloud. Anathema must not have told him about theories of the Multiverse - for that he was relieved.  
“亚当能做到那个？”阿齐拉费尔大声疑惑地问道。安娜塔玛一定没有告诉他关于多元宇宙理论的事情 - 对此他感到宽慰。

Not-Crowley perked up. “Adam is his name?”   
Not-Crowley 突然有了兴趣。“他叫亚当？”

“ _Our_ Antichrist is named Adam. Very creative boy, when he’s not trying to end the world.” They had tea at Anathema’s cottage last week. Adam was the ringleader for a new game the Them created, where Adam and Crowley teamed up as demons to destroy the world - which was contained in Anathema’s garden. The Them had to defeat the foul demons with swords made of sticks and crossing their fingers together shouting some quote from a movie, as Newt explained to him. Crowley enjoyed being part of their game even if he wouldn’t admit it.   
“我们的反基督名叫亚当。他是个非常有创造力的男孩，只要他不试图毁灭世界。”上周他们在阿纳西玛的小屋里喝茶。亚当是“他们”创造的一个新游戏的领导者，在这个游戏中，亚当和克劳利联手成为恶魔，试图摧毁被包含在阿纳西玛花园中的世界。为了打败邪恶的恶魔，他们用棍子做成的剑，交叉着手指，一起大声喊出电影中的一句台词，纽特向他解释道。克劳利享受参与他们的游戏，即使他不愿承认。

Not-Crowley seemed confused. “He still lives? And the world isn’t destroyed?”  
不是克劳利似乎感到困惑。“他还活着？世界没有毁灭？”

“Oh, we figured it out in the end,” Aziraphale said, omitting the fact that he and Crowley did very little to stop the end of the world aside from have a short chat with the Antichrist.   
“哦，最后我们弄明白了。”亚齐拉费尔说道，故意忽略了他和克劳利除了与反基督有个简短的对话外，几乎没有采取任何行动来阻止世界末日的事实。

“Right.” Not-Crowley looked around, his lips pulling into a sneer that Aziraphale recognized that he was displeased by something. “‘We’?”  
“对。” 非克劳利环顾四周，嘴角勾起一丝嘲讽，亚齐拉费尔意识到他对某事感到不满。“‘我们’？”

“Ah, right. I suppose, if you came from a second universe like you said, this must be dreadfully confusing. Come, have a seat, I’ll make some tea.” Aziraphale stepped over the mess of boxes and hurried to the back room, where the stove and his tea set still remained. He left it out just in case he felt like a tea break in between packing books.   
“啊，对了。我想，如果你真的来自另一个宇宙，这一定让你感到非常困惑。来吧，坐下，我给你泡点茶。”亚齐拉费尔踩过一堆盒子，匆忙走向后面的房间，那里还放着炉子和他的茶具。他特意留着它，以防在整理书籍的间隙想喝杯茶。

Not-Crowley followed slowly, his arms wrapped around himself as he took in the bookshop, pausing at the divine circle in the center with that displeased sneer again. He stepped around it before following where Aziraphale disappeared to.   
Not-Crowley慢慢地跟在后面，双臂紧紧地抱在胸前，他打量着书店，停在中央的神圈前，再次露出不悦的冷笑。他绕过神圈，然后跟随着亚齐拉费尔消失的方向走去。

Aziraphale handed him a freshly brewed cup - he made it the way Crowley preferred, just to see if this Not-Crowley would accept it - before showing him towards the one loveseat that remained in the back room. That one was to go in the cottage, but neither he nor Crowley had gotten around to it.   
阿齐拉费尔递给他一杯新泡的茶——他按照克劳利的喜好泡制，只是想看看这个不是克劳利的人是否会接受——然后引导他走向后房间里唯一剩下的一张双人沙发。那张沙发原本是要放在小屋里的，但他和克劳利都还没来得及搬过去。

Not-Crowley took a cautious sip, hummed in satisfaction, and took a deeper drink. Aziraphale grinned into his cup.   
不克劳利小心地喝了一口，满意地哼了一声，然后又喝了一口。阿齐拉费尔笑着看着自己的杯子。

“This is quite fascinating,” Aziraphale said to break the silence. “I do wonder what Crowley will think when he gets here.”  
“这真是相当迷人啊。”亚齐拉费尔说着打破了沉默。“克劳利到了之后，我很好奇他会有什么想法。”

Not-Crowley perked. “I assume I am the one who Fell here?” He paused. “And I go by Crowley. Hm.”   
Not-Crowley 突然振奋起来。“我猜我就是那个堕落到这里的人？”他停顿了一下。“而且我叫克劳利。嗯。”

“You do not?” 你不？

“Most call me Anthony.”  
大多数人叫我安东尼。

“Ah. That is better than Not-Crowley.”  
啊，这比不是克劳利好。

Anthony chuckled and took another sip of tea. “I agree with you. This is fascinating. Odd, but fascinating.” There was something subdued about this version of Crowley, and Aziraphale couldn’t decide if it was Heaven’s influence or something else.   
安东尼笑了笑，又喝了一口茶。“我同意你的观点。这真是令人着迷。奇怪，但又令人着迷。”这个版本的克劳利似乎有些压抑，阿齐拉费尔无法确定是天堂的影响还是其他原因。

He began to wonder what he, himself, would’ve been like, without the inhibition of displeasing Heaven. How different is Anthony’s ‘Azirafell’?   
他开始想知道如果没有顾忌得罪天堂，他自己会是什么样子。安东尼的“阿兹拉费尔”会有多不同呢？

“Crowley might be a demon, but he has a soft spot for humanity. He really is kind.” Aziraphale leaned closer, and said in a hushed tone, “But don’t tell him I said that.”   
克劳利可能是个恶魔，但他对人类有一颗软心脏。他真的很善良。”亚齐拉费尔靠近一些，低声说道：“但别告诉他我说过这话。”

Anthony seemed to understand. “Right. Azirafell never let me say anything about him like that.” His tone was soft, melancholic, and Aziraphale frowned.   
安东尼似乎明白了。“对，阿兹拉费尔从来不让我这样说他。”他的语气柔和而忧郁，阿兹拉菲尔皱了皱眉。

“Did something happen?” Angels can sense love, and Anthony was filled with it, but especially at this moment. It was love, but instead of the bright, sharp love of newlyweds or young couples, or even the dimmer yet still strong love of old spouses, the love inside Anthony was burning hot molasses, strong and unparalleled yet softened enough to melt. Not broken, but mournful.  
"发生了什么事吗？" 天使能感受到爱，而安东尼充满了爱，尤其是此刻。这是一种爱，但不是新婚夫妇或年轻情侣那种明亮、犀利的爱，也不是老夫妻那种暗淡却依然坚固的爱，安东尼内心的爱如同燃烧的热糖浆，强烈而无与伦比，却又足够柔软以融化。它没有破碎，但却充满了悲伤。

Anthony put his head in his hands and Aziraphale was quick to take their teacups and set them on some spare box nearby. His hands fluttered, because despite this ethereal being having a striking resemblance to his demon, this was not Crowley, and much rather a stranger.   
安东尼把头埋在双手中，阿齐拉费尔迅速拿起他们的茶杯，放在附近的一个空盒子上。他的手忙碌着，因为尽管这个超凡存在与他的恶魔有着惊人的相似之处，但这并不是克劳利，而是一个陌生人。

“Just before I fell into one of the Antichrist’s portals,” Anthony explained, running a hand under his tinted glasses. “I was on my way to get piss drunk. Partly because Heaven was after me after I offed Sandalphon, but mostly because I discovered Azirafell’s pawn shop flooded in holy water.”  
“就在我掉进一个反基督的传送门之前，”安东尼解释道，一只手悄悄地摸着他的有色眼镜。“我本来正要去喝个烂醉。一部分是因为天堂在我杀了桑达尔冯之后追杀我，但更多是因为我发现了阿齐拉费尔的当铺被圣水淹没了。”

_Oh_ . Aziraphale thought the circumstances sounded vaguely familiar, but couldn’t place it at the moment. He was too preoccupied with trying to comfort the grieving angel in front of him. “I’m very sorry for your loss.”   
哦。阿齐拉费尔觉得这种情况听起来有些熟悉，但此刻无法确定。他正忙着试图安慰眼前悲伤的天使。“对于你的损失，我非常抱歉。”

Anthony let out a bitter laugh. “‘Course you are.”   
安东尼苦笑了一声。“当然你是。”

Now he sounded most like Aziraphale’s Crowley, which didn’t settle well with him at all.   
现在他听起来最像阿齐拉费尔的克劳利，这让他感到非常不舒服。

He allowed Anthony to have a moment, to reel himself back in and appear presentable. Eventually, Anthony straightened, fixed his glasses and his sleeves - Aziraphale caught the curious flash of something gold before it was hidden by pink cuffs - and Anthony had finally closed himself off entirely, back to the prim and proper Archangel he needed to be.   
他允许安东尼有一会儿时间，让他恢复过来，显得整洁可观。最终，安东尼挺直了身子，整理了一下眼镜和袖子——阿齐拉费尔在粉色袖口遮住之前，瞥见了一闪而过的金色东西——安东尼终于完全封闭了自己，回到了他必须成为的规规矩矩的大天使形象。

_Archangel._ That thought was still frightening.   
大天使。那个想法仍然令人恐惧。

“I know what you’re thinking,” Anthony said, his tone back to his solid, unwavering authority. “I don’t bite.”   
“我知道你在想什么，”安东尼说道，他的语气恢复了坚定而不动摇的权威感。“我不会咬人的。”

“Which Archangel are you, if you don’t mind my asking…?” Aziraphale asked. “I don’t recall one named ‘Anthony’.”  
“如果你不介意的话，你是哪位大天使？”亚齐拉费尔问道。“我不记得有一个叫‘安东尼’的。”

Anthony’s lip quirked up in one corner. “That’s because it’s actually Raphael.”   
安东尼的嘴角微微上扬。“那是因为他实际上是拉斐尔。”

“That…makes a lot of sense.” Aziraphale had always been told that Raphael wasn’t a real Archangel. The figure had been depicted by the humans for many years, known most for his caduceus he kept by his side. Even as a fictional angel, this figure was the prime reason that snakes became a symbol of good health. That particular fad had gone out of use a few hundred years ago, much to Aziraphale’s disappointment (and to Crowley’s, though he never said so). Aziraphale always suspected that it originated from one of Crowley’s good deeds that he refused to own up to.   
“这…很有道理。”阿齐拉费尔一直被告知拉斐尔不是真正的大天使。这个形象多年来一直被人类描绘，以他身边的权杖而闻名。即使作为一个虚构的天使，这个形象也是蛇成为健康象征的主要原因。这种流行已经在几百年前不再使用，这让阿齐拉费尔感到失望（克劳利也是如此，尽管他从未说过）。阿齐拉费尔一直怀疑这是源自克劳利的一次好事，他拒绝承认。

“I never actually told him,” Anthony continued. Aziraphale could guess who he meant. “He always thought I was a Principality, actually. Thought I would scare him off if I just approached a demon with all six wings flapping about.” He ran a stressed hand across his forehead. “Then I just never told him. And he died before I could.”  
“我从来没有真正告诉过他。”安东尼继续说道。阿齐拉费尔能猜到他指的是谁。“他一直以为我是一个大天使，事实上。他认为如果我只是接近一个展翅飞舞的恶魔，我会吓跑他。”他用一只紧张的手搓了搓额头。“然后我就从来没有告诉过他。在我能够告诉他之前，他就去世了。”

“Is it possible he could just be discorporated?” It was a weak question, one that was met with a hard glare of golden eyes over tinted glasses.   
“他有可能只是失去了肉体吗？”这是一个弱智的问题，一个被金色眼睛透过有色眼镜狠狠地盯着的问题。

“You know precisely what holy water does to a demon.”   
你清楚地知道圣水对恶魔有何作用。

Aziraphale nodded. He still felt a twist of guilt knowing that he had gifted Crowley with that sort of weapon. It was only a bit of relief now that he knew for certain Crowley had no intentions of using it on himself.   
亚齐拉费尔点了点头。他仍然感到一丝内疚，因为他给克劳利赠送了那种武器。现在他确信克劳利没有打算用它对付自己，这让他稍微松了口气。

He does not know what he would do if he found Crowley as a puddle on the floor.  
他不知道如果他发现克劳利变成了地板上的一滩水，他会怎么办。

“The way you’ve spoken of this,” Aziraphale said, choosing his words carefully. “Is Armeggeddon still happening in your world?”  
“你刚才说的方式，”亚齐拉费尔小心地选择着措辞说道。“在你的世界里，末日审判还在继续吗？”

Anthony nodded. He sagged against the loveseat as if all the energy had been drained out of him. Aziraphale was certain that he had been running on nervous fumes since falling through a portal.  
安东尼点了点头。他瘫倒在情侣沙发上，仿佛所有的能量都被抽干了。阿齐拉费尔确信自从穿越传送门后，他一直在紧张的情绪中度过。

“Well,” Aziraphale said, cautious. Archangels are his higher ups, and even after dismissing Heaven entirely, there was still that deep-seated anxiety when faced with one. “As a version of Azirafell…” Anthony’s golden eyes narrowed. “I would say that he would want you to do your best in stopping the Apocalypse. For him.”   
“嗯，”亚齐拉费尔小心地说道。大天使是他的上级，即使他完全放弃了天堂，面对一个大天使时仍然有一种根深蒂固的焦虑。“作为亚齐菲尔的一个版本……”安东尼的金色眼睛眯了起来。“我会说他希望你尽力阻止末日。为了他。”

Anthony’s mouth twisted in a pained grimace, his eyes flaring with ethereal rage. Aziraphale couldn’t help flinching back. He had been trained to respect the higher ranks of angels since his creation, but Archangels were to be feared. Even if the face looking at him was his dearest friend.   
安东尼的嘴扭曲成痛苦的苦笑，他的眼睛闪烁着超凡的愤怒。阿齐拉费尔不禁退缩了一下。自从他被创造出来，他就接受过尊敬天使高阶的训练，但大天使是应该被害怕的。即使那张脸是他最亲爱的朋友。

Anthony seemed to realize this belatedly. He sunk back, blowing out a sharp exhale of air. “Don’t say things like that with his face.”   
安东尼似乎有点迟钝地意识到了这一点。他退缩了一下，吹出一口急促的气息。“别当着他的面说那样的话。”

Aziraphale didn’t reply, instead anxiously tapping his fingers on his knees. The tea cups sitting aside had gone cold, but he couldn’t bring himself to stand and prepare a new batch.   
亚齐拉费尔没有回答，而是焦虑地在膝盖上敲打着手指。放在一旁的茶杯已经变冷了，但他无法让自己站起来准备新一轮。

Thankfully, the tense silence was interrupted by the phone. The vintage rotary blared a loud charm, startling Anthony out of his brooding. Aziraphale hastily stood from the loveseat and rushed over, knowing who must be on the other end.   
幸运的是，紧张的沉默被电话打破了。那台复古的旋转电话发出了一声响亮的铃声，把安东尼从沉思中吓了一跳。阿齐拉费尔匆忙从情侣沙发上站起来，急忙走过去，知道一定是另一端的人打来的。

“Crowley?” He answered, vaguely noticing Anthony cock his head in interest.   
“克劳利？”他回答道，隐约注意到安东尼对此感到好奇地歪了歪头。

“ _Yeah, angel,_ ” Crowley came from the other end, a relief to hear. “ _Listen, we got a uh, situation over here_ .”   
“是的，天使，”克劳利从另一头传来，听到他的声音让人松了一口气。“听着，我们这边出了个，嗯，情况。”

“Oh, I do too,” Aziraphale said. “Are you on your way here?”  
“哦，我也是。”亚齐拉费尔说道。“你在路上吗？”

“ _Actually, I’m on my way to Tadfield_ ,” Crowley said, and Aziraphale could now make out the distant hum of the Bently on the other end of the line. “ _Hard to explain, but can you meet me at Anathema’s?_ ”  
“其实，我正要去塔德菲尔德，”克劳利说道，而阿齐拉费尔此时能听到电话那头远处宾利车的嗡嗡声。“很难解释，但你能在安娜西玛那里见我吗？”

“Of course. I was going to suggest we go there, too.” Aziraphale said. “Will you--”  
“当然。我本来也打算建议我们去那里。”亚齐拉费尔说道。“你会--”

“ _Already called her, Adam should be there when we get there._ ”   
已经给她打过电话了，我们到那儿的时候亚当应该已经在那里了。

“It sounds like you already know what’s happened, dear,” Aziraphale suggested. He didn’t notice as his fingers tangled in the coiled cord of the phone.   
“亲爱的，听起来你已经知道发生了什么事情了。”亚齐拉费尔提议道。他没有注意到自己的手指已经纠缠在电话的线缆中。

“ _Good to know I’m right. You should hurry, though. Heaven is sure to have felt that power burst._ ”  
好知道我是对的。不过你应该赶快。天堂肯定感受到了那股力量的爆发。

Aziraphale hadn’t thought of that. It wouldn’t do them any good if Heaven caught wind of another Archangel.   
亚齐拉费尔没有考虑到这一点。如果天堂得知另一个大天使的存在，对他们没有任何好处。

“We’ll see you soon, dear.”   
“亲爱的，我们很快就会见面。”

“ _Yup_ .”  "是的。"

The line went dead, and Aziraphale replaced the phone with a fond smile. It was grounding to hear Crowley’s voice, especially after this strange afternoon with someone who is identical to his demon but vastly different.   
电话那头突然没声音了，亚齐拉费尔带着亲切的微笑放下了电话。能听到克劳利的声音真是让他感到踏实，尤其是在与一个和他的恶魔一模一样却又截然不同的人度过了这个奇怪的下午之后。

When he turned back to Anthony, he found the Archangel already watching him, his head tilted to the side, something soft in his features as his golden eyes dragged up and down Aziraphale’s form. Something dreamily, like he wasn’t entirely there.   
当他转身回到安东尼身边时，他发现大天使已经在注视着他，他的头微微倾斜，脸上带着柔和的表情，他的金色眼睛在阿齐拉费尔的身上上下扫视。有一种梦幻般的感觉，好像他并不完全在场。

Aziraphale cleared his throat, and Anthony snapped his eyes away, coming back to himself. “Crowley is headed to Tadfield. I’ll call a taxicab and we’ll be on our way.”   
亚齐拉费尔清了清嗓子，安东尼把目光移开，回到了自己的思绪中。“克劳利正朝塔德菲尔德赶去。我会叫辆出租车，我们马上出发。”

Anthony hesitantly stood, tucking his hands in his pockets. “Tadfield?”  
安东尼犹豫地站起来，把双手插进口袋里。“塔德菲尔德？”

“I’ll explain on the way. But we should be wary. Crowley thinks Heaven must have felt your arrival here.”   
“我会一边走一边解释。但我们应该小心。克劳利认为天堂一定能感觉到你来到这里。”

Anthony blanched. “Right.”   
安东尼脸色苍白。“好的。”

Aziraphale phoned a taxicab, and the two ethereal beings slid into the vehicle on their way to Tadfield.   
阿齐拉费尔打电话叫了一辆出租车，两个超凡存在滑进车里，前往塔德菲尔德。

\-

As this was happening, exiting South Downs and on its way to Tadfield, a dark Bently was inhabited by two creatures of the occult.   
当这一切发生时，离开南唐斯，前往塔德菲尔德的路上，一辆黑色的宾利车里坐着两个神秘生物。

“Anathema’s a witch?” "Anathema是个女巫吗？"

“Yes.” 是的。

“And she’s friends with the Antichrist?”  
"她和反基督是朋友吗？"

“Yep.” "是的。"

“And his name is Adam?”  
“他的名字是亚当吗？”

“Uh-huh.” "嗯嗯。"

“But we shouldn’t kill him?”  
“但是我们不应该杀了他？”

“Nope.” 不。

The demon version of his angel, Azirafell, was certainly a vacuum of never ending questions. Crowley, though he would never admit it, quite liked the company. Azirafell’s style was not unlike the angel’s, but at least he had a refreshingly different pattern to hyperfixate on. Although he wasn’t sure if he liked such dark colors on his angel.   
他的天使版本的恶魔，阿齐拉费尔，无疑是一个永无止境的问题漩涡。克劳利虽然不会承认，但他相当喜欢这种陪伴。阿齐拉费尔的风格与天使的相似，但至少他有一个令人耳目一新的不同迷恋模式。尽管他不确定自己是否喜欢他的天使穿上如此深色的衣服。

Personality, however. Azirafell was a riot.   
然而，阿齐拉费尔的个性却非常另类。

Ever since the demon popped into existence in the center of his garden, yelling about sergeants and faulty exorcisms, it has been like finding his worst other half. Once they got over the initial introductions, things have been going smoothly. Well, ‘smoothly’ as defined by two demons with a love of mischief.   
自从恶魔突然出现在他的花园中央，大喊着关于中士和失败的驱魔术的事情，就像找到了他最糟糕的另一半一样。一旦他们度过了最初的相互介绍，事情就一直顺利进行着。当然，这里所说的“顺利”是指两个喜欢恶作剧的恶魔之间的情况。

Azirafell was fascinated with his eyes, mentioning something about how, “Anthony always had a penchant for serpents,” which lead to Crowley boasting about his time as the Serpent of Eden, which lead to Azirafell goading about _his_ time as the Bird of Eden, which has lead to a strained air of competitiveness ever since.   
Azirafell对此着迷地眨着眼睛，提到了“安东尼一直对蛇情有独钟”，这引起了克劳利吹嘘自己曾是伊甸园的蛇，接着Azirafell又引诱说自己曾是伊甸园的鸟，从那时起，竞争的气氛就变得紧张了。

All the while, Crowley had tried to get Azirafell caught up on current events. According to the new demon, they were in the middle of stopping the Apocalypse before Adam began opening portals to their universe. Azirafell had accidentally fallen in one that appeared in his pawn shop as Shadwell tried to perform an exorcism straight out of _The Exorcist_ . Crowley had never tested that theory, but he was glad to know that it remained a fictional TV trope.   
一直以来，克劳利一直试图让阿齐拉费尔了解当前的事件。根据这位新恶魔的说法，他们正在阻止亚当在他们的宇宙中打开传送门之前的启示录。阿齐拉费尔在他的典当店里意外掉进了一个传送门，当沙德韦尔试图进行一场《驱魔人》式的驱魔仪式时。克劳利从未验证过这个理论，但他很高兴知道这只是一个虚构的电视剧情。

Not long after Azirafell arrived, there was another shocking splinter in the air, much stronger than before. The lights flickered, the ground shook. Azirafell looked just as concerned as Crowley.   
不久之后，阿齐拉费尔到达后，空气中再次出现了一道令人震惊的裂缝，比之前的要强烈得多。灯光闪烁，大地震动。阿齐拉费尔看起来和克劳利一样担忧。

“I hope that was Anthony,” He said with a strained chuckle.   
他带着勉强的笑声说：“我希望那是安东尼。”

They formed a half-baked plan, got Aziraphale on board, and then they were on their way to Tadfield.  
他们制定了一个半吊子计划，拉上了阿齐拉费尔，然后就动身前往塔德菲尔德。

Now, he was just answering whatever questions the demon had about their post-apocalypse world.   
现在，他只是回答恶魔对于他们的末日世界所提出的任何问题。

Azirafell had gone momentarily quiet, however. He had his chin perched on his hand, watching Crowley with his strange double pupils. Under the steady beat of Queen’s _Bohemian Rhapsody_ , the magpie demon mumbled something incoherent.  
阿齐拉费尔暂时安静了下来。他用手托着下巴，用奇特的双瞳注视着克劳利。在女王乐队的《波西米亚狂想曲》的稳定节奏下，这只喜鹊恶魔嘟囔着一些不清楚的话。

“Yes?” Crowley prompted.   
"什么事？" 克劳利催促道。

Azirafell hummed. “Oh, I’m just thinking aloud.” He almost seemed sheepish now, but it was gone as quick as Crowley noticed it, replaced with a cheeky grin. He was still not used to Aziraphale’s face appearing so lax, without the threat of Heaven’s expectations hanging over his head.   
阿齐拉费尔哼了一声。“哦，我只是在自言自语。”他现在看起来有些害羞，但克劳利注意到后，这种感觉就消失了，取而代之的是一个调皮的笑容。他还不习惯阿齐拉菲尔的脸看起来如此轻松，没有天堂期望的威胁悬在他头上。

“Humor me,” Crowley said, returning his eyes to the road. “We still got a ways.”  
“开个玩笑吧，”克劳利说着，把目光重新投向道路。“我们还有一段路要走。”

There was a pause, and Crowley wondered if Azirafell decided to drop it. Then, a huff. “What would you be…willing to give up for your Aziraphale?”  
有一段停顿，克劳利想知道阿兹拉费尔是否决定放弃这个问题。然后，一个嗤笑声。“为了你的阿兹拉菲尔，你愿意放弃什么？”

Crowley sent him a narrowed look, one eyebrow raised. Azirafell backtracked.   
克劳利狠狠地瞪了他一眼，一只眉毛扬起。阿齐拉费尔立刻收回了话。

“Okay, how about this: if you were an angel, and your angel a demon, would you…Fall for him?”  
好的，这样怎么样：如果你是一个天使，而你的天使是一个恶魔，你会…为他堕落吗？

Crowley scoffed. _Subtle._ He let his sunglasses drop to the tip of his nose, his eyes turned to fix on Azirafell, who appeared to already know what the answer will be. “Without a doubt.”  
克劳利嗤之以鼻。真是微妙。他让太阳镜滑落到鼻尖，目光落在阿齐拉费尔身上，后者似乎已经知道答案会是什么。“毫无疑问。”

Still, the magpie demon pouted.   
然而，喜鹊妖却噘起了嘴。

“What did you think I was going to say?” Crowley continued. “You have your own Crowley, after all.”  
“你以为我会说什么？”克劳利继续说道，“毕竟你有你自己的克劳利。”

“Yes, but I’d hoped there was an Anthony out there with some sense,” Azirafell argued.   
“是的，但我希望有一个有点理智的安东尼存在。”亚齐拉费尔辩论道。

“What’s that supposed to mean?”  
这是什么意思？

“ _I mean_ , that you _Anthonys_ apparently lack any self preservation,” Azirafell said, waving an irritated hand. “Throwing yourselves into danger, all for the sake of some irrelevant demon - or angel in your case--”  
“我的意思是，你们这些安东尼似乎缺乏自我保护意识，”阿齐拉费尔不耐烦地挥了挥手。“为了一些无关紧要的恶魔，或者在你们的情况下是天使，而将自己置于危险之中。”

“You’re not _irrelevant_ ,” Crowley argued, something fierce that he’s held back for six thousand years flaring in his chest. “And did it ever occur to you that you _Aziraphales_ might have _too much_ self preservation?”  
“你并不无关紧要，”克劳利争辩道，他在胸中憋了六千年的强烈情感燃烧起来。“难道你们阿齐拉费尔也从未想过自我保护可能过度了吗？”

“I beg to differ. I’m not just looking out for myself, I’m trying to keep Anthony from doing something he’d regret…!”  
我不同意。我不仅仅是为了自己着想，我试图阻止安东尼做出他会后悔的事情...！

“He won’t regret it, I can promise you that.”  
他不会后悔的，我可以向你保证。

“But what about your Aziraphale? What if he Fell because of you? Wouldn’t he regret it?”  
“但是你的阿齐拉费尔呢？如果他因为你而堕落了呢？他会后悔吗？”

“Would you?” 你愿意吗？

Crowley fixed him with another snake-eyed stare, knowing that the Bently was more than capable of avoiding any traffic disasters by itself. Azirafell squirmed in his seat, his pout twisting into a displeased frown.   
克劳利再次用蛇一般的眼神盯着他，知道那辆宾利完全有能力自己避免任何交通灾难。阿齐拉费尔在座位上扭动着，嘴角扭曲成不满的皱纹。

“...Yes.” "是的。"

“Liar.”  骗子。

Azirafell huffed, settling back against the carseat. “We’re demons. It’s what we do.”  
阿齐拉费尔嘟囔着，靠在汽车座椅上。“我们是恶魔，这就是我们的本性。”

There was an awkward silence between them, broken only by _You’re My Best Friend_ flooding through the speakers. Crowley had a feeling that the Bently wouldn’t let him change it.   
他们之间出现了尴尬的沉默，只被《You're My Best Friend》从扬声器中传出的音乐打破。克劳利有一种感觉，那辆宾利不会让他换掉这首歌。

“You know why I wouldn’t regret it?”  
你知道为什么我不会后悔吗？

Azirafell kept his gaze steady on the road ahead of them, but his attention was undoubtedly on Crowley.   
阿齐拉费尔将目光稳定地投向前方的道路，但他的注意力无疑集中在克劳利身上。

“Because I already lost Aziraphale once.” A beat, then Azirafell fully turned towards him. Crowley continued, “Before Armeggeddon passed, I found his bookshop up in flames. I thought it was hellfire. That the angels had gone after him like the demons went after me. Only he wasn’t so lucky to escape.” His thumbs tapped a pattern on the wheel, an anxious tick. “I decided to wait for the end of the world by getting piss drunk. And wouldn’t you know, at my worst moment, a discorporated Aziraphale appears in front of me.” He chuckled bitterly. “He couldn’t see how much of a mess I was, thank Somebody.” He met Azirafell’s pained blue eyes. “I’ve wanted to live for that angel since he told me he gave his flaming sword away, but it wasn’t until then that I realized I couldn’t live without him there beside me.”  
"因为我已经失去过阿齐拉费尔一次了。” 顿了一下，然后阿齐拉费尔完全转向他。克劳利继续说：“在世界末日之前，我发现他的书店被大火吞噬。我以为那是地狱之火。天使们像恶魔追杀我一样追杀他。只是他没有那么幸运逃脱。” 他的拇指在方向盘上敲击着一种紧张的节奏。“我决定通过喝醉酒来等待世界的末日。你知道吗，在我最糟糕的时刻，一个无形的阿齐拉费尔出现在我面前。” 他苦笑着说。“他看不到我有多糟糕，谢谢某个人。” 他与阿齐拉费尔痛苦的蓝眼相对。“自从他告诉我他放弃了他的火焰剑，我就想为那个天使而活，但直到那时我才意识到，没有他在我身边，我无法生活。”

Azirafell had an odd color to his face. His jaw dropped, Crowley could make out a pair of faintly defined fangs. His double pupils almost made it easier to read his expressions. Or maybe this version of Aziraphale lacked a filter.  
阿齐拉费尔的脸色有些奇怪。他的下巴掉了下来，克劳利能看出一对模糊可见的尖牙。他的双瞳几乎让人更容易读懂他的表情。或许这个版本的阿齐拉费尔缺乏过滤器。

Then Azirafell turned away, shaking his head. He muttered, more to himself, “Ridiculous. Ridiculous…”  
然后阿齐拉费尔转身离开，摇着头。他喃喃自语道：“荒谬。荒谬……”

There wasn’t going to be any further conversation, Crowley could tell. Instead, he turned up the radio, now playing the upbeat melody of _Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy_ .  
克劳利能感觉到，接下来不会有任何进一步的对话。于是，他把收音机音量调高，现在播放的是欢快的旋律《好老式情人》。

\-

Anthony was unnerved, to say the least.   
安东尼感到非常不安，至少可以这么说。

He had tucked himself on the far end of the taxicab seat to stare out the window as the angel Aziraphale took the opposite side. Knees tucked together, hands in his lap, back as straight as if there was a ruler shoved down his spine. Bowtie knotted at his throat, his clothes in pristine condition yet a little worn around the buttons. His Azirafell would never allow such ware on his clothes. His Azirafell wouldn’t be sitting so proper, be fiddling with his fingers so anxiously, or stand sitting in such silence.   
他把自己藏在出租车座位的远端，凝视着窗外，而天使阿齐拉费尔则坐在对面。膝盖并拢，双手放在膝盖上，背挺得笔直，仿佛脊椎上塞了一把尺子。领带打了个结，衣服保持着完好的状态，但纽扣周围有些磨损。他的阿齐拉费尔绝不会容忍衣物磨损。他的阿齐拉费尔不会坐得这么端正，也不会如此焦虑地玩弄手指，更不会保持这样的沉默。

Anthony sighed. With a wave of his hand, the driver of the cab will conveniently have no memory of this drive once the trip was completed. He turned in place to face the Principality, golden eyes over tinted glasses.   
安东尼叹了口气。他挥了挥手，出租车司机在行程结束后将方便地忘记这次的驾驶。他转身面对公国，透过有色眼镜的金色眼睛。

Aziraphale seemed to squirm under his gaze. He let out a strangled, “What?”  
亚齐拉费尔似乎在他的注视下有些不安。他发出了一声压抑的“什么？”

“Don’t look at me like I’m about to smite you,” Anthony requested. “That was the whole point of going by Anthony instead of Raphael.”   
“别用那种眼神看着我，好像我要惩罚你一样。”安东尼请求道。“这就是为什么我选择用安东尼而不是拉斐尔的原因。”

“Right.” Aziraphale still didn’t seem to heed his advice. “It is just difficult to break the habit. Gabriel has been breathing down my neck for years.”   
“对。”亚齐拉费尔似乎仍然没有听从他的建议。“只是很难改掉这个习惯。加百列已经在我身后催促了好多年了。”

“Ugh, Gabe. What a bastard.” That got the Principality to smirk. “Can’t imagine having him as a boss.”   
“唉，盖伯。真是个混蛋。”这让公主微笑了起来。“想象不出他当老板的样子。”

“It is just as you describe,” Aziraphale said, some of the tension between them released.   
“正如你所描述的那样，”亚齐拉费尔说道，他们之间的一些紧张感得到了释放。

A pause. Anthony cleared his throat. “I didn’t mean to invoke any… ‘heavenly wrath’ on you earlier. Sorry.” Aziraphale’s gaze flickered to his, and even those blue eyes were different. “It’s been a difficult day.”   
停顿。安东尼清了清嗓子。“我之前并不是有意招惹你遭受任何‘天谴’。抱歉。”亚齐拉费尔的目光转向他，即使那双蓝眼睛也变了。“今天过得很艰难。”

Aziraphale’s expression softened. “I understand.”  
亚齐拉费尔的表情变得温和起来。“我明白。”

The angel had such round features that his demon counterpart shared, but the way Aziraphale expresses is vastly different. His smiles are soft, almost shy, as if he has to be wary of what shows on his face. Heaven’s influence, no doubt. Anthony almost wants to reach out, tear those boundaries down, to see the manic grin that always graces Azirafell’s features when Anthony was around.   
天使和他的恶魔对应物有着相似的圆润面容，但阿齐拉费尔表达方式却截然不同。他的微笑温柔而几乎害羞，仿佛他必须小心脸上的表情。毫无疑问，这是天堂的影响。安东尼几乎想伸手，打破那些界限，看到阿齐拉费尔在他身边时总是挂在脸上的狂乱笑容。

_Azirafell_ . Seeing the angel across from him reminded Anthony of what he’s lost. And yet, he couldn’t bring himself to resent Aziraphale. Even in other universes, Anthony adored him. The apple of his eye - he snorted at the thought.  
阿齐拉费尔。看到对面的天使让安东尼想起了他失去的东西。然而，他无法怨恨阿齐拉费尔。即使在其他宇宙中，安东尼也崇拜他。他眼中的掌上明珠——他对这个想法嗤之以鼻。

Aziraphale gave him a questioning look. Anthony shrugged.   
亚齐拉费尔疑惑地看着他。安东尼耸了耸肩。

“I did think about what you said,” Anthony admitted. “But, I pose an argument.”  
"我确实考虑了你说的话，"安东尼承认道。"但是，我提出一个论点。"

“Is that right?” "对吗？"

“Yes.” Aziraphale had explained their roles to stopping the End of Times before the silence had stifled the interior of the cab. “Adam will choose his human side whether or not both Azirafell and I are there, or he will give in to his power and end the world anyway. So,” He turned in his seat to properly face the other angel. “What is the point of going back?”  
“是的。”阿齐拉费尔在沉默笼罩出租车内部之前已经解释了他们阻止世界末日的角色。“亚当无论阿齐拉费尔和我是否在场，都会选择他的人类一面，或者屈服于他的力量，无论如何都会毁灭世界。所以，”他转过身来，正视着另一个天使。“回去的意义是什么呢？”

Aziraphale opened his mouth but didn’t speak right away, his brows knitted together in confusion.   
亚齐拉费尔张开嘴巴，但并没有立即说话，他的眉头紧锁，表情困惑。

“I mean, that’s what we’re doing right? Finding your Antichrist to bring me back?”  
“我的意思是，这就是我们正在做的事情，对吧？找到你的反基督来把我带回去？”

“I--yes,” Aziraphale said. “But, you don’t belong here.”  
“我——是的，”亚齐拉费尔说道。“但是，你不属于这里。”

“Let me explain it to you this way,” Anthony continued, ignoring Aziraphale’s frown. “Either I get destroyed along with my planet, or even worse, I go back to a world without Azirafell in it.” Aziraphale flinches at this. “I don’t prefer either option, honestly.”  
“让我这样给你解释一下，”安东尼继续说道，无视了阿齐拉费尔的皱眉。“要么我和我的星球一起被摧毁，要么更糟糕的是，我回到一个没有阿齐拉费尔的世界。” 阿齐拉费尔听到这句话不禁畏缩了一下。“老实说，我都不喜欢这两个选择。”

“...I don’t believe that’s the correct solution,” Azirapale said, hushed.   
“……我不相信那是正确的解决方案。”亚齐拉菩尔低声说道。

“Would it be so bad to have two of us around?” Anthony felt a desperation rise in him. The angel in front of him was not his Azirafell, but Anthony wasn’t about to give up a second chance when it was handed to him. “A demon on one arm, an Archangel on another. You’d be the most protected Principality this world has ever seen.”   
“如果有两个我们在身边，会有什么不好？”安东尼感到一股绝望在他心中升起。站在他面前的天使并不是他的阿齐拉费尔，但安东尼不会放弃这个第二次机会。"一只恶魔在一只手臂上，一位大天使在另一只手臂上。你将成为这个世界上最受保护的主天使。”

Anthony wasn’t one for tempting, that was Aizrafell’s job, but he had learned a thing or two over the years. He lifted a delicate hand to brush at the angel’s curls, so _achingly_ like his demon’s, as Aziraphale’s face froze and took on a new shade of color. He trailed his fingers down the angel’s cheek to follow it, his touch so gentle, so soft.   
安东尼并不擅长引诱，那是艾兹拉费尔的工作，但多年来他学到了一些东西。他抬起纤细的手，轻轻地抚摸着天使的卷发，如此令人心痛地像他的恶魔一样，而阿齐拉费尔的脸上冻结了，变成了一种新的颜色。他的手指沿着天使的脸颊滑过，跟随着它，触摸如此温柔，如此柔软。

He could get used to it. This angel was not Azirafell, but looked and seemed so much like him.   
他可以习惯这种感觉。这个天使不是阿齐拉费尔，但看起来和他非常相似。

Then, a haunting phrase came to mind: _You go too fast for me, Anthony._   
然后，一句令人心生恐惧的话浮现在脑海中：“安东尼，你走得太快了。”

He pulled away.  他挣脱开。

“Up to you, I guess.” Anthony resumed watching the streets of London pass by the window. He tucked his hands in the pockets of his jacket just to keep them from doing anything else. “Think about it.”   
"随你便，我猜。”安东尼继续注视着伦敦的街道从窗外掠过。他把双手插进夹克口袋里，只是为了让它们不再做其他事情。“好好考虑一下。”

Aziraphale didn’t say anything else. When Anthony chanced a glance, he had his hands tucked in his lap and eyes pointed straight ahead, his posture rigid and cold, his expression carefully guarded. Anthony huffed and looked away. Azirafell would speak his mind, whether or not it got him the response he wanted. He wasn’t used to this swallowing silence.  
亚齐拉费尔没有再说什么。安东尼瞥了一眼，他双手放在膝盖上，眼睛直视前方，姿势僵硬冷漠，表情小心翼翼。安东尼嘟囔了一声，转过头去。亚齐菲尔会直言不讳，不管他是否得到想要的回应。他不习惯这种沉默。

The rest of the ride was tense, until the confused taxicab driver dropped them off at Jasmine Cottage. Anthony briefly cocked his head at the dark Bentley parked just outside - “wrong color,” he muttered to himself - before finally following Aziraphale up to the door.   
剩下的车程一直很紧张，直到困惑的出租车司机把他们送到茉莉小屋。安东尼短暂地瞥了一眼停在外面的黑色宾利车，自言自语地说：“颜色不对。”最后他终于跟着阿齐拉费尔走向门口。

The door was opening before the Principality could knock. The woman on the other side had round glasses, a pair which Anthony thought was a pleasant choice of style, along with long, dark hair and a patterned dress. She appeared relieved to see them.   
在公主敲门之前，门就打开了。门的另一边站着一个戴着圆形眼镜的女人，安东尼觉得这是一种令人愉悦的时尚选择，她还有一头长长的黑发和一件有图案的连衣裙。她看到他们时似乎松了一口气。

“Oh, good,” The woman, Anathema the Witch as Anthony remembered, “You’re here. They’re with the children out back.”   
“哦，太好了。”女人安娜塞玛，正如安东尼记得的那样，“你来了。他们和孩子们在后院。”

“Thank you, dear,” Aziraphale said, smiling pleasantly. He gestured to his companion. “This is Anthony. I assume Crowley told you about our situation over the phone?”  
“谢谢你，亲爱的。”亚齐拉费尔愉快地微笑着说道。他向他的伴侣示意。“这位是安东尼。我猜克劳利在电话里跟你说了我们的情况吧？”

“Yup,” Anathema said, leaning against the door frame as they entered. “I guess I should be grateful I forgot my periodicals about multiverse theories back home.”   
“是的，”安娜塞玛说着，靠在门框上进来。“我想我应该庆幸我把有关多元宇宙理论的期刊都忘在家里了。”

“I’m grateful about that, too.”  
我对此也感激不尽。

Anathema lead them through the house, where they passed a young man Anthony wasn’t warned about, watching through glass doors into the garden. He turned at their approach.   
Anathema带领他们穿过房子，经过了一个安东尼没有被警告过的年轻人，透过玻璃门望向花园。他在他们走近时转过身来。

“Oh,” The man said. “Crowley, but an angel, right?”  
“哦，”那个男人说道。“克劳利，但是是个天使，对吗？”

“Anthony,” He corrected.   
"安东尼，"他纠正道。

“Newt, he doesn’t have snake eyes!” Anathema pointed at Anthony excitedly.   
“纽特，他没有蛇眼！”安娜塔玛兴奋地指着安东尼说道。

The man, Newt, groaned. “Ugh. Fine. I’ll cough up the money tomorrow. But I still stand by my point that snakes aren’t inherently evil.”   
那个名叫纽特的男人呻吟道：“唉，好吧。明天我会掏钱。但我仍然坚持我的观点，蛇并非天生邪恶。”

“Who says that?” Anthony asked, mildly offended, simultaneously with Aziraphale’s, “Of course not!”   
“谁说的？”安东尼有点生气地问道，同时阿齐拉费尔也说道：“当然不是！”

They glanced at each other then immediately looked away. Anathema stifled a laugh.   
他们相互瞥了一眼，然后立刻别开了视线。安娜塞玛忍住了笑声。

“Just go get your boyfriends,” She said, sliding open the glass door.   
“去找你的男朋友们吧，”她说着，推开玻璃门。

Anthony moved forward not on his own accord, his mind only catching up with the plural ‘boyfriends’ when he was already standing in the garden. There, he froze.   
安东尼并非出于自愿前进，当他已经站在花园里时，他的思绪才追上了“男朋友们”这个复数概念。在那里，他停住了。

One young boy with tousled hair stood on the back of a bench, one arm outstretched with a pair of sunglasses perched on his forehead. Along his shoulders was a long, red-bellied snake, baring fangs at three other children, but quite clearly not going to attack. On the ground, holding various toy weaponry, were two young boys and a girl with a dog scampering around their feet and barking madly. One other young boy, who Anthony recognized as Warlock but not _their_ Warlock, was standing off to the side, a stick hanging limply in one hand while he scrolled through his phone in the other.  
一个头发凌乱的年轻男孩站在长凳的后面，一只手伸出来，夹在额头上的是一副太阳镜。沿着他的肩膀上，蜿蜒着一条长长的红腹蛇，对着另外三个孩子露出毒牙，但显然不会攻击。在地上，两个年轻男孩和一个女孩手持各种玩具武器，他们的脚边有一只狗四处奔跑，疯狂地叫着。另外一个年轻男孩，安东尼认出他是沃洛克，但不是他们的沃洛克，站在一边，一只手里拿着一根松弛下垂的棍子，另一只手在手机上滑动。

They had entered the back yard just in time to hear the boy shout, “ _Attack from above!_ ”  
他们刚好走进后院，就听到男孩大喊：“从上方袭击！”

Then there, in the sky, was a giant magpie just as unnaturally large as the serpent, two pairs of eyes on either side of its head, as it swooped from the sky and circled the children with ear-piercing caws. It nipped at them, startling one of the boys into falling and tripping backwards, but without inflicting any actual damage. The kids shrieked in laughter, hitting the air with their foam swords and ducking to the ground. Warlock was hit with a wing and was startled into dropping his phone with a sharp curse. The only one still standing as the magpie landed on the bench next to Adam was the girl.   
然后，在天空中，有一只巨大的喜鹊，就像那条蛇一样不自然地巨大，它的头两侧各有一对眼睛，从天空中俯冲而下，发出刺耳的啼声，围绕着孩子们盘旋。它啄了他们一下，吓得其中一个男孩摔倒并向后绊倒，但并没有造成任何实际伤害。孩子们笑得尖叫起来，用泡沫剑击打空气，躲到地上。巫师被喜鹊的翅膀击中，吓得咒骂一声手机掉在地上。当喜鹊降落在亚当旁边的长椅上时，唯一还站着的是那个女孩。

“I destroyed War, I’ll destroy you too!” She shouted, pointing a stick at the ‘demons’ occupying the bench.   
“我摧毁了战争，我也会摧毁你！”她大声喊道，用一根棍子指着占据长椅的‘恶魔’。

Anthony didn’t really take in the rest of the scene, however. He was stuck on the magpie, such a familiar form that it made him freeze on the spot.   
然而，安东尼并没有真正注意到场景的其他部分。他被那只喜鹊所吸引，它是如此熟悉的形象，以至于他呆在原地。

Then the bird noticed him. It noticeably perked up, its feathers ruffling and a squeal of delight coming out of its beak. The next second, it was upon him.   
然后鸟儿注意到了他。它明显地振奋起来，羽毛蓬松，从嘴巴里发出一声欢叫。下一秒，它就扑向了他。

\-

Azirafell didn’t know how happy it would make him to see Anthony again.   
阿齐拉费尔不知道再次见到安东尼会让他多么开心。

His irritation at Crowley was short-lived, as those things tended to go. They went to discussing their various temptations over the years, starting at the very first in the Garden. They each had a love of causing chaos in the streets of Soho, and Azirafell was finally glad to have _someone_ agree with him on quantity over quality (and especially someone to bitch with about Hastur).   
他对克劳利的恼怒很快就过去了，就像那些事情通常会发生的那样。他们开始讨论他们多年来的各种诱惑，从花园里的第一个开始。他们都喜欢在苏豪街上制造混乱，而亚齐拉费尔终于很高兴有人同意他的数量优于质量的观点（尤其是有人可以抱怨哈斯特尔）。

Crowley was just as grumpy as Anthony, but a lot more willing to show it. He was such a whine-ass too, but Azirafell wasn’t demonic enough to say that to his face.   
克劳利和安东尼一样脾气暴躁，但他更愿意表现出来。他也是个抱怨鬼，但亚兹拉费尔不够恶魔，不敢当面说出来。

Anathema was nice enough, a bit underwhelming for a witch, and her boyfriend had the most forgettable face, but the Antichrist and his friends were a team no one could ever forget. Warlock vaguely recognized him as ‘Other Brother Francis’ and told him his coat looked stupid before going back to his gameboy. They all seemed to understand the situation fairly well - “My mother once told me about quantum theory. I think that’s the same thing,” Pepper said - and took it in stride. Adam asked Azirafell a couple questions - “What’s with your eyes?” “Can you also turn into a snake?” - which the demon couldn’t refuse to answer. It was the reason he Fell after all, and he quickly grew proud of this other Antichrist.   
Anathema还不错，对于一个女巫来说有点平庸，她的男朋友长得非常普通，但是那个反基督和他的朋友们是一个永远不会被人忘记的团队。Warlock模糊地认出他是“其他的弗朗西斯兄弟”，告诉他他的外套看起来很傻，然后继续玩他的游戏机。他们似乎都对这个情况有很好的理解 - “我妈妈曾经告诉过我量子理论。我觉得那是一回事，”Pepper说道 - 并且从容应对。亚当问了阿齐拉费尔几个问题 - “你的眼睛怎么了？” “你也能变成蛇吗？” - 那个恶魔无法拒绝回答。毕竟，这就是他堕落的原因，他很快对这个其他的反基督感到自豪。

Then the children had roped both demons into their little game, which Azirafell absolutely adored. It was a hell of a lot more fun to pretend to dominate the world than it was to actually do it.   
然后孩子们把这两个恶魔都牵扯进了他们的小游戏中，而阿齐拉费尔绝对喜欢这个。假装统治世界比真的去做要有趣得多。

And then - some cherubic copy of him that could fit on the Sistine Chapel walked out the door, followed by his Anthony. Not the demonic version, not any other versions out there, but his positively glowing angel.   
然后 - 一个可以适应西斯廷教堂的天使般的他的复制品走出门外，后面跟着他的安东尼。不是邪恶的版本，也不是其他版本，而是他那个发光的天使。

Azirafell couldn’t wait for their game to finish. He leapt from the edge of the bench, shifting out of his magpie form in the air and landing on his two feet. Never having qualms about showing affection, Azirafell threw his arms around his angel.   
阿齐拉费尔迫不及待地等待着他们的游戏结束。他从长凳的边缘跃起，在空中变回人形，双脚着地。阿齐拉费尔从不犹豫地表达感情，他抱住了他的天使。

“Oh, Anthony!” Azirafell exclaimed. “You’re finally here! You must meet Adam, he asks so many questions, you’ll just adore him! And the other you? Oh, you’ll have your hands full with the both of us--!”   
“哦，安东尼！”阿齐拉费尔惊呼道。“你终于来了！你一定要见见亚当，他问了那么多问题，你会喜欢他的！还有另一个你呢？哦，你将会忙得不可开交，因为我们两个都会让你忙个不停——！”

He stopped as he realized Anthony was shaking. Azirafell pulled back just in time to see a tear roll down the angel’s cheek  
当他意识到安东尼在颤抖时，他停了下来。阿齐拉费尔及时退了回去，看到一滴泪从天使的脸颊上滑落。

“Oh, my dear.” Azirafell gently cupped Anthony’s chin, catching the stray tear on his thumb. “What happened?”  
“哦，亲爱的。”阿齐拉费尔轻轻托起安东尼的下巴，用拇指接住他脸上的一滴泪水。“发生了什么事？”

Anthony’s breath stuttered. He snatched Azirafell’s wrist and turned his face against his palm, closing his eyes. Azirafell froze. Helplessly glanced up, down. Let himself savor it another moment - surely another world’s God couldn’t cast Anthony down, but this wasn’t something he took risks on - before Azirafell pulled his hand away. Anthony didn’t fight it, but he had a resigned acceptance on his face that was somehow scarier than an argument.   
安东尼的呼吸突然停顿了。他抓住了阿齐拉费尔的手腕，将脸埋在手掌中，闭上了眼睛。阿齐拉费尔僵住了。无助地上下打量了一下。他让自己再享受一会儿——肯定是另一个世界的神不会抛弃安东尼，但这不是他愿意冒险的事情——然后阿齐拉费尔抽回了手。安东尼没有反抗，但他脸上流露出一种接受的无奈，这比争论更可怕。

“Angel!”  “天使！”

Azirafell turned to see Crowley, shifted out of snake form, approach and wrap an arm around the other angel - Aziraphale. Ugh, names.   
阿齐拉费尔转过身来看到克劳利，从蛇形态变回人形，走近并搂住另一个天使——阿齐拉菲尔。唉，名字。

“Shush, my dear,” Aziraphale said, already tugging his demon towards the house, where Anathema and Newt had disappeared with the children. “Give them a moment.”   
“嘘，亲爱的，”亚齐拉费尔说着，已经拉着他的恶魔朝着房子走去，安娜塞玛和纽特已经带着孩子们消失了。“给他们一点时间。”

With that, they both disappeared, the cherub giving a short wave before the glass door was shut behind them. Not all that effective; he could see the children spying through it, hands cupped around their faces with no qualms about being seen.   
说完这句话，他们俩就消失了，小天使在玻璃门关上之前还挥了挥手。效果并不太好，他能看到孩子们透过玻璃偷窥，毫不在意被发现。

He returned his attention back to Anthony just in time to see him fix the tinted glasses on his face. Azirafell scoffed.   
他及时将注意力转回安东尼身上，只见他戴上了有色眼镜。亚齐拉费尔嗤之以鼻。

“Oh, get those ridiculous things off.” He plucked the pair easily off the end of Anthony’s nose and tossed them somewhere behind him, ignoring Anthony’s indignant cry. The angel had cleared his expression of anything revealing what he was so distraught about earlier, now sporting his familiar disdainful sneer.   
"噢，把那些荒谬的东西摘下来。"他轻松地从安东尼的鼻子上拔下那副眼镜，随手扔到身后的某个地方，无视安东尼愤怒的呼喊。天使的表情已经恢复了平静，不再流露出之前的痛苦，现在他又露出了那熟悉的傲慢冷笑。

“That was unnecessary.” He pouted.   
"那真是没必要的。" 他撅着嘴说道。

“And you’re dodging,” Azirafell pointed out. Anthony looked away. “What’s the matter, dear?” He paused, glancing over Anthony’s shoulder to the house. “Did the Other-Me hurt you?”   
“而且你在躲避。”亚齐拉费尔指出。安东尼别过头去。“怎么了，亲爱的？”他停顿了一下，瞥了一眼安东尼的肩膀，看向房子。“是不是那个另一个我伤害了你？”

Anthony scoffed. “Of course not. Unlike you, I don’t think he’d hurt a fly.”   
安东尼嗤之以鼻。“当然不会。不像你，我觉得他连只苍蝇都不会伤害。”

“Can’t be too careful, my dear.”   
亲爱的，小心谨慎永远不为过。

Another pause. Azirafell crossed his arms and tilted his head, smiling pleasantly while Anthony twitched under his waiting stare. It wasn’t long after that when Anthony finally broke.   
又一次停顿。阿齐拉费尔双臂交叉，歪着头，愉快地微笑着，而安东尼在他等待的目光下不安地颤动着。不久之后，安东尼终于崩溃了。

He let out a long suffering sigh. “I thought you were dead, you fiend.”   
他发出了一声长叹。“我以为你已经死了，你这个恶魔。”

Azirafell cocked his head. “Dead? Why would you think that?”  
阿齐拉费尔歪了一下头。“死了？你为什么会这么想？”

“Your pawn shop. Before I fell here--” He gestured around vaguely. “--I found your shop flooded. Thought it was holy water, that the demons went after you like the angels went after me.”  
你的当铺。在我跌落到这里之前——”他含糊地四处指指点点。“——我发现你的店被水淹了。以为是圣水，恶魔像天使追逐我一样追逐你。”

“Oh, you don’t think I can handle a few minor demons?” Azirafell teased. Then he registered the rest of Anthony’s response. “My pawn shop flooded?”  
“哦，你不觉得我能应付几个小恶魔吗？”阿齐拉费尔调侃道。然后他注意到安东尼的回答。“我的当铺被淹了？”

“Completely soaked. Not sure how much of your trinkets are waterproof.”   
彻底湿透了。不确定你的小玩意有多少是防水的。

“Eh, most enough. Except for the old journals, misprinted Bibles, books…” He paused, his eyes widening. “Oh, the book! The one by Agnes Nutter-!”   
“嗯，差不多了。除了那些旧杂志、印刷错误的圣经、书籍……”他停顿了一下，眼睛睁大了。“哦，那本书！阿格尼丝·纳特的那本书！”

“ _Nice and Accurate Prophecies?_ ” Anthony fished in the inner pockets of his jacket before pulling out the exact copy that Azirafell left in the shop. “Took it as a, uh, souvenir.”  
“准确而美好的预言？”安东尼在夹克的内袋里摸索着，然后拿出了阿兹拉费尔在店里留下的完全一样的副本。“当作，呃，纪念品了。”

Azirafell snatched it and flipped through it, relieved to find no water damage. “Oh, thank you, my dear. I meant to tell you that I found where the Antichrist is with this, but I suppose…” He nodded towards the house. “That’s not needed anymore.”   
Azirafell抓过来翻了翻，松了一口气，发现没有水损。"哦，谢谢你，亲爱的。我本来想告诉你，我找到了这个反基督的所在地，但我想..."他朝着房子点了点头。“那已经不再需要了。”

“Right.” Anthony stepped back, summoned another pair of tinted glasses to perch on his nose, before turning to walk towards the house. “Well, if we want to stop our Antichrist from destroying the world, we should go talk to the kid.”   
"好的。" 安东尼退后一步，又取出一副有色眼镜戴在鼻梁上，然后转身朝房子走去。"嗯，如果我们想阻止我们的反基督毁灭世界，我们应该去和那个孩子谈谈。"

Anthony’s full extent of his thoughts and feelings were always held back, restrained by the threat of Heaven’s expectations, but for the last few years he was never shy to speak his mind - Azirafell’s influence, he supposed, as much as he denied it - it was as if he _wanted_ to Fall. Azirafell wasn’t a blind demon, however. He knew that Anthony must be held with higher respect than other low-level angels, or else he’d have joined Azirafell down Below by now. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. That idea frightened the demon, though he never spoke of it out loud.   
安东尼一直都抑制着自己的思想和感情，因为他害怕天堂的期望。但在过去几年里，他变得毫不羞怯地表达自己的想法——他猜想这是阿兹拉费尔的影响，尽管他一直否认。仿佛他渴望堕落一样。然而，阿兹拉费尔并不是一个盲目的恶魔。他知道安东尼必须得到比其他低级天使更高的尊重，否则他早就会加入阿兹拉费尔下界了。但这并不意味着不可能。这个想法让恶魔感到恐惧，尽管他从未公开说过。

Now, though. Anthony appeared more closed off than before.   
现在，安东尼看起来比以前更封闭。

Crowley’s admission earlier came to mind - _You know why I wouldn’t regret it?_ \- and he suddenly felt sick watching his dear friend walk away, feeling privy to feelings he probably wasn’t supposed to know about.   
克劳利早先的承认浮现在脑海中——你知道我为什么不会后悔吗？——他突然感到恶心，看着自己亲爱的朋友离开，意识到自己或许知道了不该知道的感受。

_Anthoneys_ . Always dramatic, always protective.   
安东尼斯。总是戏剧化，总是保护性的。

He managed to catch the angel’s sleeve before Anthony got too far away.   
他设法在安东尼离得太远之前抓住了天使的袖子。

“My dear,” Azirafell said. Even with his tinted glasses on, he could see Anthony’s steady golden gaze, very unlike Crowley’s. Much easier to lose his train of thought. “Ah. I just, well…”   
“亲爱的，”阿齐拉费尔说道。即使戴着有色眼镜，他仍然能看到安东尼稳定的金色目光，与克劳利截然不同。这让他更容易分心。“啊，我只是，嗯……”

Steeling himself, he twisted his grip to easily link his fingers with Anthony’s. Before either of them could chicken out, Azirafell placed a hand firmly on top.   
他鼓起勇气，扭动手腕，轻松地与安东尼握手。在他们中任何一人退缩之前，阿兹拉费尔坚定地将手放在上面。

“When this Apocalypse nonsense is over, I do believe we should talk,” He said, placing careful emphasis on ‘talk’.   
“当这个末日胡言乱语结束之后，我确实认为我们应该谈谈。”他说着，特别强调了“谈谈”。

Anthony appeared stunned for a few seconds, blinking slowly as if he couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Then, jerkily, he nodded.   
安东尼出现了几秒钟的惊讶，眨着眼睛，好像他不敢相信自己听到的话。然后，他颤抖地点了点头。

“Right,” He said, voice strangled. “We should. Yes. Of course.”  
“好的。”他说道，声音带着窒息感。“我们应该。是的。当然。”

Azirafell looked down, knowing he was unable to hide the uncharacteristically fond grin on his face, and instead trailed an absent finger down the back of Anthony’s hand. Anthony shivered as Azirafell paused at his wrist. His pink sleeves had fallen back an inch or so, and Azirafell caught a flash of gold--  
阿齐拉费尔低头看着，知道自己无法掩饰脸上那不寻常的喜悦笑容，于是他随意地用手指沿着安东尼的手背轻轻划过。安东尼感到一阵寒意，当阿齐拉费尔在他的手腕停顿时。他的粉色袖子稍微滑落了一英寸左右，阿齐拉费尔瞥见了一闪而过的金色--

Then the sliding glass door opened and Adam poked his head out.   
然后滑动玻璃门打开了，亚当探出头来。

“We’re ready in here whenever you lovebirds are--!”   
“只要你们这对恋人准备好了，我们这边随时都可以！”

Two hands came out of the depths of the house to pull him back in. There was muffled laughter as the door shut again, and Anthony pulled away.   
两只手从房子的深处伸出来，把他拉了回去。门再次关上时，传来了闷闷的笑声，安东尼挣脱了开来。

“Yes, we’ll--we’ll talk,” He said, then awkwardly turned on his heel and marched towards the cottage.   
“好的，我们会……我们会谈的。”他说着，然后尴尬地转身朝小屋走去。

Azirafell didn’t think much about the gold after that, but it floated in the back of his mind for later.   
之后，阿齐拉费尔对那些金子并没有太多的想法，但它在他的脑海中悬浮着，留待以后。

\-

Aziraphale grabbed one of the boy’s arms while Crowley snatched the other, tugging Adam back into the house while his little friends giggled. Adam didn’t seem bothered by the interruption.   
亚齐拉费尔抓住男孩的一只胳膊，而克劳利则抓住另一只，把亚当拉回屋子里，而他的小朋友们咯咯地笑着。亚当似乎对这个打断并不在意。

“They were taking too long,” He said simply, with an innocent smile.   
他简单地说：“他们花了太长时间。”他带着天真的微笑。

“They always take too long,” Warlock muttered from his place at the cottage dining table, gameboy in his hand with his feet propped on the surface. “They were too busy making out--”   
“他们总是花太长时间，”巫师从他在小屋餐桌上的位置嘟囔道，手里拿着游戏机，脚搁在桌面上。“他们太忙于亲热了——”

“I think that’s enough, dearie,” Crowley warned, slipping easily into his Nanny voice like second nature.   
“我觉得够了，亲爱的。”克劳利警告道，毫不费力地转换成他的保姆声音，就像第二天性一样。

Newt leaned down to murmur to Warlock. “You will tell us what it was like growing up with those two, won’t you?”  
纽特弯下腰对着沃洛克低声说道：“你会告诉我们和那两个一起长大是什么感觉吗？”

Anathema appeared on the other side of him with a notebook. “I’d like to take notes.”   
安娜塞玛拿着一本笔记本出现在他的另一边。“我想记笔记。”

Warlock only shrugged. “Leave me alone and I’ll think about it.”   
术士只是耸了耸肩。“别打扰我，我会考虑一下。”

“I can most assuredly promise we weren’t busy because of that,” Aziraphale chimed in. Like he could ever forget the lectures on plant care he’d receive every night from Nanny Ashtoreth, pointing out every plant he miracled alive from the brink of death.   
“我可以非常肯定地承诺，我们并不是因为那个原因而忙碌，”亚齐拉费尔插话道。就像他永远不可能忘记每晚从阿什托雷斯保姆那里接受的植物护理讲座一样，她总是指出他从死亡边缘奇迹般地救活的每一株植物。

No one seemed to believe him. Crowley grinned cheekily at him.   
似乎没有人相信他。克劳利咧嘴一笑看着他。

The conversation was interrupted when the glass door slid open again as Anthony and Azirafell entered the cottage. Compared to earlier, Aziraphale noticed that Anthony seemed a little lighter. He should’ve assumed that Heaven’s authority mattered very little to any version of Crowley, and that the weight bearing on Anthony’s shoulders was in fact only the supposed death of Azirafell. Now that he’s back, Anthony had motivation to return his own universe again - and they can hopefully move past whatever happened during the ride here.   
当安东尼和阿兹拉费尔走进小屋时，对话被玻璃门再次打开而中断。与之前相比，阿兹拉费尔注意到安东尼似乎轻松了一些。他本应该意识到天堂的权威对克劳利的任何版本来说都无关紧要，而安东尼肩上的负担实际上只是阿兹拉费尔的所谓死亡。现在他回来了，安东尼有了回到自己宇宙的动力，他们希望能够超越在这里的旅程中发生的一切。

Aziraphale hadn’t properly met his ‘other self’ yet, but he could see right away that this demon version had a higher standard of style than he did. The magpie aesthetic was certainly fitting, especially after witnessing their little game in the garden. Aziraphale was very fond of his clothes - 180 years he’s kept this particular outfit in tact, that’s true dedication - but he was almost jealous.  
阿齐拉费尔还没有正式见过他的“另一个自己”，但他立刻就能看出这个恶魔版本的风格要比他高一筹。喜鹊般的审美确实非常合适，尤其是在目睹了他们在花园里的小游戏之后。阿齐拉费尔非常喜欢他的衣服——他已经保持了180年的这套特定服装，这是真正的奉献——但他几乎有点嫉妒。

Then Azirafell brazenly hooked his arm with Anthony’s, grinning wide with sharp canines. He had never seen his own face as easy to read as an open books. Those eyes made it hard to tell exactly where the demon was looking, but that did not change that this Azirafell did not live his life as carefully guarded as his angel counterpart.  
然后，阿齐拉费尔大胆地挽起安东尼的胳膊，露出尖利的犬齿，笑容满面。他从未见过自己的脸像一本敞开的书那样容易被读懂。那双眼睛让人难以确定恶魔究竟在看什么，但这并不改变阿齐拉费尔过着与他的天使对应者相比更加不加防范的生活。

That made Aziraphale actually jealous.   
这让亚齐拉费尔真的有点嫉妒。

“I think it’s about time we stop the impending Apocalypse back in our world,” Azirafell said. “Don’t you agree, dear?”  
“我觉得是时候阻止即将来临的世界末日了，”阿齐拉费尔说道。“亲爱的，你不同意吗？”

“I think so as well, fiend,” Anthony said, his expression softening for the first time since Aziraphale had met him. He gave a little cheer to himself, happy to have reunited them.   
“我也这么认为，朋友，”安东尼说道，他的表情自与阿齐拉费尔相识以来首次柔和了下来。他为自己的成功团聚感到高兴，心里暗自庆幸。

“Are you ready, Adam?” Anathema asked, placing a motherly hand on the kid’s shoulder.   
“亚当，你准备好了吗？”安娜塞玛问道，把母性的手放在孩子的肩膀上。

“I think so,” Adam said, shrugging. “I don’t actually know what I’m doing.”   
“我想是的，”亚当耸耸肩说道。“实际上我并不知道自己在做什么。”

“I’m sure it’s as simple as that.” Crowley snapped his fingers to emphasize. “Just imagine that you’re bringing them home. Keep it simple.”   
“我确定就是这么简单。” 克劳利强调地打了个响指。“就想象你把它们带回家一样。保持简单。”

Adam nodded. He got the same concentrated look on his face that he had back at the airbase, facing down Satan himself. He lifted his hands and began rubbing them together. There was a crackle in the air, almost like static electricity. Aziraphale noticed Crowley crowd close to him as the lights above them flickered.   
亚当点了点头。他脸上浮现出了与之前在空军基地时一样的专注表情，仿佛面对撒旦本人一样。他抬起双手开始搓揉，空气中传来一阵噼啪声，几乎像是静电。阿齐拉费尔注意到克劳利靠近他，头顶的灯光闪烁不定。

A rolling wave of thunder rocked the sky. Adam paused.   
一阵滚滚雷声震动着天空。亚当停下了脚步。

“Someone’s coming,” He said.   
"有人来了，"他说道。

Another crackle of thunder. Aziraphale felt a chill run up his spine, realization dawning on him. Glancing to the other pair, he noticed Anthony felt it, too.  
又一声雷鸣。阿齐拉费尔感到一阵寒意从脊椎上升起，他意识到了什么。他瞥了一眼另外一对人，注意到安东尼也有同样的感觉。

“Gabriel,” Anthony said, slowly, as if unsure.  
“加布里埃尔，”安东尼慢慢地说道，仿佛不确定的样子。

There was another crackle as the sky suddenly stormed, another warning call of thunder. Aziraphale sighed.   
天空突然暴风雨，又传来一声雷鸣的警告。亚齐拉费尔叹了口气。

“I’ll go answer him,” He said, heading to the back door. Aziraphale waved to the out-of-place pair. “Get home safely, you two.”   
“我去回答他，”他说着，朝后门走去。亚齐拉费尔向这个不合时宜的一对挥手道：“你们两个回家路上小心。”

“Angel, no.” Crowley stepped up beside him. “What if it’s a trap?”  
“天使，不行。” 克劳利走到他身旁。“要是这是个陷阱呢？”

“I think we scared them off well enough last time,” Aziraphale said. “And besides, I don’t believe he’s here for me.”   
“我觉得上次我们吓得他们够呛，”亚齐拉费尔说道。“而且，我不相信他是来找我的。”

“He’s right,” Adam said, though didn’t appear to know why he knew. “I think it’s because of him.” He pointed to Anthony, who kept his gaze down.   
“他说得对。”亚当说道，尽管他似乎不知道自己为什么知道。“我觉得是因为他。”他指着安东尼，安东尼一直低着头。

Azirafell cocked his head. “Because of Anthony?”  
阿齐拉费尔歪了一下头。“因为安东尼的事情吗？”

“Well, you two will be gone soon enough anyway,” Aziraphale said. “I’ll keep Gabriel distracted. Act fast.”   
“嗯，你们两个很快就会离开了，”亚齐拉费尔说道。“我会让加百列分心，你们要快行动。”

With that, he slipped out of the house and into the garden, looking up at the rumbling sky. The wind had picked up and his jacket flapped around him as he waited.   
说完这句话，他悄悄地走出屋子，来到花园里，抬头望着隆隆作响的天空。风渐渐变大，他的夹克在他身边猎猎作响，他静静等待着。

A bolt of lightning shot down in front of him, singing the ground as Gabriel manifested before him, dressed as primly as usual, with a tight expression on his face. It was an odd look, one that Aziraphale had never seen on the Archangel.   
一道闪电在他面前劈下，烧焦了地面，加百列在他面前显现出来，穿着一如往常整洁的服装，脸上带着紧绷的表情。这是一种奇怪的表情，亚齐拉费尔从未在大天使脸上见过。

“Principality Aziraphale,” Gabriel greeted, voice tight. It suddenly struck Aziraphale then; he was _afraid_ .   
"亚齐拉费尔亲王，" 加百列紧张地打招呼。这时，亚齐拉费尔突然意识到他害怕了。

A little bit of his anxiety melted away. “Archangel Gabriel.” Then, while attempting to summon the same grin he had seen on Azirafell, “What a pleasant surprise. What brings you to Earth?”  
他的焦虑稍稍消散了一些。“大天使加百列。”然后，试图挤出与亚撒菲尔相似的笑容，“真是个惊喜。你来地球有什么事？”

To his delight, Gabriel seemed to shrink back. “Ah. Well. We felt a disturbance from up Above, and thought you and your _demon_ might know something about it.”   
令他高兴的是，加百列似乎退缩了一下。“啊，嗯。我们感觉到了来自上方的干扰，以为你和你的恶魔可能知道一些情况。”

Aziraphale hummed. “I don’t believe I know what you mean. Care to elaborate?”  
亚齐拉费尔哼了一声。“我不明白你的意思。能详细解释一下吗？”

Gabriel pressed his lips together in a tight line. “Whatever it was made quite an impact. Every angel in Above felt it. Even humans noticed it.”  
加布里埃尔紧紧地咬住嘴唇。“无论是什么，它产生了相当大的影响。上方的每个天使都感受到了。甚至人类也注意到了。”

“Well, now that you mention it, I believe I did notice something earlier.” Aziraphale tapped his chin as if thinking about it. “But neither Crowley or I have anything to do with it.”  
“嗯，既然你提到了，我想我确实之前注意到了一些事情。”亚齐拉费尔轻轻拍了拍下巴，仿佛在思考。“但是克劳利和我都与此无关。”

Gabriel visibly bristled. “You must have something to do with it. We checked all the systems and it’s not coming from either end.”  
加布里埃尔明显愤怒了起来。“你一定和这有关系。我们检查了所有的系统，都没有发现问题。”

“Either end? Are you consorting with the enemy again Gabriel? Do be careful, I believe that’s grounds for death by a cyclone of hellfire.”  
“要么结束？你又和敌人勾结了吗，加百列？小心点，我相信这是会被地狱火龙卷风处决的理由。”

There was something very satisfying watching Gabriel scowl like that. Like he released a little bit of six thousand years of pent up anger. Aziraphale might have continued his taunts, when he heard the door slide open behind him and Crowley sauntered out from the house.  
看到加百列那样皱眉的样子真是让人心满意足。就像他释放了六千年积压的愤怒一样。阿齐拉费尔本来可能还要继续嘲弄他，但他听到身后门滑开的声音，看到克劳利从房子里悠然走出来。

“Crowley?” Aziraphale asked, watching the demon fix his sunglasses into place. “What are you…?”  
“克劳利？”亚齐拉费尔问道，看着恶魔把太阳镜戴好。“你在做什么……？”

“The demon Crawly,” Gabriel said, summoning back his bravado. He wouldn’t dare look like a frightened Archangel in front of a _demon_ . “I can assure you that your superiors will have a word with you shortly.”   
“恶魔克劳利，”加百列召回他的勇气说道。他不敢在恶魔面前显得像一个受惊的大天使。“我可以向你保证，你的上级很快会找你谈话。”

“Uh, actually, minor correction,” Crowley said. There was something slightly off about him, but Aziraphale couldn’t pinpoint it right away. “I don’t actually answer to those guys anymore.”   
“嗯，实际上，小修正一下，”克劳利说道。他身上有些微妙的不对劲，但阿齐拉费尔一时间无法准确指出。"我实际上已经不再向那些家伙们报告了。”

“That hardly matters since you’re still a demon.” Gabriel glared. “It’s a miracle that Aziraphale hasn’t joined you yet.” He didn’t even laugh at his own lame joke, which began to set off warning bells in Aziraphale’s head.   
“这并不重要，因为你仍然是个恶魔。”加百列怒视着。“真是个奇迹，亚齐拉费尔还没有加入你的行列。”他甚至没有对自己的无聊笑话发笑，这开始在亚齐拉费尔的脑海中引起警钟。

“Ah, I’ll have to correct you again on that.”   
啊，我得再次纠正你的说法。

Gabriel paused. “Which part?”  
加布里埃尔停顿了一下。“哪个部分？”

Crowley removed his sunglasses, revealing not the serpentine slits, but glossy gold. Aziraphale realized then that the tattoo on the side of his face was missing. _Oh_ .   
克劳利摘下了他的太阳镜，露出了一双不再是蛇状缝隙的闪亮金眼。亚齐拉费尔意识到他脸上的纹身不见了。哦。

“I’m not a demon.”   
我不是恶魔。

Anthony rolled up his sleeves, where his forearms bore bright serpent trails down to the backs of his hands. He clapped his hands twice, and the serpents curled down from the tips of his fingers to twine together in an embrace glowing like molten gold. The glow dimmed to reveal a caduceus that Anthony gripped with both hands. He slammed the end of the staff into the ground, sending vibrations across the garden as three sets of massive white wings burst into existence behind him.   
安东尼卷起袖子，他的前臂上有明亮的蛇纹一直延伸到手背。他拍了两下手，蛇从指尖蜿蜒而下，缠绕在一起，散发着像熔化的黄金一样的光芒。光芒渐渐暗淡，露出安东尼双手握住的权杖。他猛地将权杖的末端砸向地面，震动传遍整个花园，紧接着他背后浮现出三对巨大的白色翅膀。

Aziraphale never had the privilege to watch Gabriel’s face when Crowley blew hellfire at the Archangels. The terror he saw now more than made up for that. Gabriel stood with his mouth open like a gaping fish, unable to form words.   
亚齐拉费尔从未有幸目睹加百列在克劳利向大天使们喷射地狱之火时的表情。而现在，他所见到的恐惧远远弥补了那一切。加百列张着嘴，像一条张大嘴的鱼一样，无法说出一句话。

“But--That’s….impossible….”  
"但是...那是...不可能的..."

Anthony tucked the sunglasses carefully at the collar of his shirt. He smiled lazily at Gabriel.   
安东尼小心地把太阳镜塞在衬衫领口处。他慵懒地对加布里埃尔微笑着。

“Now, where were we, Brother?”  
“现在，我们上次说到哪了，兄弟？”

\-

“Did you just lick me?!”  
你刚刚舔我了吗？

Crowley wiped his hand off on the tan trousers he was tricked into wearing. Azirafell pushed away from him, crossing his arms and pouting.   
克劳利用他被骗穿上的浅棕色裤子擦了擦手。阿齐拉费尔从他身边退开，双臂交叉，嘟着嘴。

“ _You_ wouldn’t let go,” Azirafell pointed out. He spun back towards the glass doors and looked ready to bolt again when Crowley latched a hand on his elbow.   
“你不会放手的，”亚齐拉费尔指出。他转身朝玻璃门走去，看起来准备再次逃跑，但克劳利抓住了他的胳膊。

“He’ll be _fine_ ,” Crowley said. He glanced out through the glass. “Looks like Gabe’s already pissing himself anyway.”   
“他会没事的，”克劳利说道。他透过玻璃瞥了一眼。“看起来加布已经吓得尿裤子了。”

Crowley was considerably miffed when the Other-Him decided to step in, like he knew what was good for _his_ angel. It was enjoyable to watch Gabriel squirm from the window. He made a mental note to buy crepes for Aziraphale later just for standing up to his old boss like this. But the sight must have put Anthony on edge, because the next thing Crowley knew was that he was wearing a pink button-up with a horrid white sweater and a rose on his lapel.   
克劳利对另一个他的干涉感到相当恼火，就好像他知道对天使有好处一样。从窗户上看加百列挣扎是很有趣的。他心里记下了要给阿齐拉费尔买可丽饼，因为他敢这样站出来对抗他的老板。但这一幕一定让安东尼感到不安，因为克劳利接下来发现自己穿着一件粉色的纽扣衬衫，配着一件可怕的白色毛衣和一朵胸花。

“Ay, what the--”  “哎呀，什么--”

“Gabriel is going to smite him if we don’t do something,” Anthony said, fixing Crowley’s sunglasses into place. He was the spitting image of his demonic counterpart, minus the tattoo by his ear and misbehaving hair. In fact, Crowley grumped at the idea that he looked like a more cleaned-up version of himself.   
“如果我们不采取行动，加百列会惩罚他的。”安东尼说着，把克劳利的太阳镜整理好。他和他那个恶魔对应的形象一模一样，只是耳朵旁边的纹身和不服管束的头发不一样。事实上，克劳利对自己看起来更整洁的形象感到不满。

Crowley looked out the window again - noticed the orange-pink tint and pulled those poor excuses for glasses off - and this time truly did see how out of sorts Gabriel was getting. He began getting a sick feeling in his stomach.   
克劳利再次望向窗外——注意到了橙粉色的色调，摘下那些糟糕的眼镜——这一次真正看到了加百列变得多么不对劲。他开始感到一阵恶心。

“Keep him safe,” He said to Anthony, who nodded and slid out the back door.   
“保护好他。”他对安东尼说道，安东尼点了点头，然后悄悄地从后门溜了出去。

That was when the fancy lightshow happened, because as it turned out, Other-Him was an Archangel. Who would’ve guessed?  
那时候发生了一场华丽的灯光秀，因为事实证明，另一个他是一位大天使。谁能猜到呢？

Azirafell didn’t, apparently. He had made to bolt out the door when Crowley got an arm around him, one on his waist and the other over his mouth to keep from interrupting the moment and giving away the fact that no, Crowley the Demon didn’t suddenly turn into an Archangel.   
显然，Azirafell并没有这样做。当克劳利用一只手臂搂住他，另一只手放在他的腰上，还有一只手捂住他的嘴，防止他打断这一刻并泄露出这个事实：克劳利这个恶魔并没有突然变成大天使。

“You should be more worked up about this,” Azirafell said, gesturing out the window. “That’s _you_ .”   
“你应该对这件事更加激动起来，”亚齐拉费尔说着，指着窗外。“那就是你。”

“No, it isn’t.” Crowley was only too sure of that fact. “Hardly matters now anyway. Hell doesn’t exactly care about status in Heaven.”   
“不，不是。”克劳利对这个事实非常确定。“无论如何，现在几乎无关紧要了。地狱对天堂的地位并不在乎。”

Azirafell made a move to argue, but he couldn’t deny that it was true.   
阿齐拉费尔想要辩驳，但他无法否认这是事实。

The Them were looking out the windows now, Warlock had even joined them, Anathema and Newt watching over their shoulders. The sight of an Archangel puts fear in low level demons - aside from the one exception - but for humans, it’s a sight to behold. Crowley didn’t remember much from before the Fall, but he had a sneaking suspicion that if he used to be an angel of such a high level, then he wouldn’t be where he is today. Maybe that’s why Aziraphale doesn’t Fall in this world. Maybe that’s the root of this strange butterfly effect.   
他们现在都在窗户边观望，连沃洛克也加入了他们，阿纳西玛和纽特则在他们的肩膀上看着。看到大天使会让低级恶魔感到恐惧，除了一个例外，但对于人类来说，这是一种令人惊叹的景象。克劳利对堕落之前的记忆不多，但他隐隐觉得，如果他曾经是一个如此高级的天使，那么他今天就不会处在这个地方。也许这就是为什么阿齐拉费尔在这个世界上没有堕落的原因。也许这就是这种奇怪的蝴蝶效应的根源。

Curious, always curious. But right now wasn’t the time to ask impossible questions.   
好奇心，总是好奇心。但现在不是问不可能的问题的时候。

It was with another crack of thunder that Gabriel disappeared from the garden. Crowley watched Anthony and Aziraphale exchange a few short words before Anthony’s wings and staff disappeared, and the pair came back to the cottage.   
随着又一声雷鸣，加百利从花园中消失了。克劳利看着安东尼和阿齐拉费尔交换了几句话，然后安东尼的翅膀和法杖消失了，他们一起回到了小屋。

Azirafell immediately met Anthony with a somber stare and crossed arms. Crowley knew that he had tons of questions just waiting, but he was demonic enough to make Anthony feel guilty for a little while.   
阿齐拉费尔立刻用一种忧郁的眼神和交叉的手臂迎接安东尼。克劳利知道他有很多问题等着问，但他足够恶魔，让安东尼感到一阵内疚。

“...Sorry,” Anthony eventually admitted.   
"...对不起，" 安东尼最终承认了。

“That was epic!” Warlock shouted, running up to Crowley. “Nanny! Can you do that too?”  
“太燃了！”术士大声喊道，跑到克劳利身边。“保姆！你也能做到吗？”

Crowley shot a scowl at Anthony. “Of course dearie, but _much_ more evil.”   
克劳利瞪了安东尼一眼。“当然亲爱的，但更加邪恶。”

Aziraphale sighed. “We don’t have to keep teaching him like that, you know.”   
亚齐拉费尔叹了口气。“我们不必继续像那样教他了，你知道的。”

“Well--” “嗯——”

“Okay! This time for real!” Adam clapped his hands together, gaining the attention of the rest of the room. Once again, he began rubbing his hands together, and the air filled with energy. Pepper, Wensleydale, and Brian tried to get Warlock’s long hair standing up.   
"好了！这次是真的！" 亚当拍了拍手，吸引了房间里其他人的注意。他再次开始搓手，空气中充满了能量。佩珀、温斯利戴尔和布莱恩试图让沃洛克的长发竖起来。

In the corner, Crowley noticed Anthony take Azirafell by the hands and murmur quiet words. Some private discussion that no one else was meant to be privy to. Crowley gently took Aziraphale’s arm and lead him a few feet away.  
在角落里，克劳利注意到安东尼牵起了阿齐拉费尔的手，低声细语。一些私人的讨论，其他人不应该知道的。克劳利轻轻拉着阿齐拉费尔的手臂，将他带离了几步远。

“I’ll be honest,” Aziraphale said, voice low. “I’ll be happy to be the only Aziraphale and Crowley on Earth again.”  
“说实话，”阿齐拉费尔低声说道。“我很高兴能再次成为地球上唯一的阿齐拉费尔和克劳利。”

“Yeah? Kinda wished I learned a bit more about Other Me,” Crowley said, curiosity still poking at the back of his mind.   
“是吗？有点希望我多了解一些关于另一个我。”克劳利说道，好奇心仍然在他脑海中挠痒着。

Something pained crossed Aziraphale’s face. “He is certainly unique.”   
阿齐拉费尔的脸上闪过一丝痛苦之色。“他确实与众不同。”

There was something more to that, but Crowley didn’t get a chance to ask when a bright light flashed inside the cottage. Blinking the spots out of his eyes, a white line had opened up in front of Adam.   
那件事情还有更多，但克劳利没来得及问，当一道明亮的光闪过小屋内。眨了眨眼睛，亚当面前出现了一道白线。

“Is that it?” Wensleydale asked.   
"就这样了吗？" 温斯利戴尔问道。

“I think so,” Adam said.   
"我这么认为，" 亚当说道。

“Well, dear,” Azirafell said, holding out a hand to Anthony. “Let’s stop the End of the World.”   
“亲爱的，”阿齐拉费尔说着，伸出手给安东尼。“让我们停止世界末日吧。”

“Are we sure this leads back to our world?” Anthony asked, skeptically examining the slit in reality.   
“我们确定这条通道会回到我们的世界吗？”安东尼怀疑地审视着现实中的裂缝。

“That’s what I thought of.” Adam shrugged.   
“这就是我想的。” 亚当耸耸肩。

“One way to find out.” Azirafell sent a wink to Anthony before stepping through the portal.   
“找出答案的一种方法。” Azirafell向安东尼眨了眨眼，然后走进了传送门。

Anthony tried and failed to reach out for him. “ _Ugh_ , you fiend!”   
安东尼试图接触他，但未能成功。"呃，你这个恶魔！"

There was a pause, and Crowley almost got concerned - then a hand with a magpie-themed sleeve reached out, fluttered his fingers, and disappeared again.   
有一段停顿，克劳利几乎感到担忧——然后一只带有喜鹊图案袖子的手伸出来，轻轻地挥动了一下手指，然后又消失了。

Anthony sighed. “I guess that’s my leave.” He turned to the rest of them. “Uh, thank you. For helping us. And I hope Gabriel leaves you alone now.” He smiled, tense, at Aziraphale. “So. Farewell.”   
安东尼叹了口气。“我想这就是我的离开了。”他转向其他人。“嗯，谢谢你们帮助我们。希望加百利现在会离开你们了。”他紧张地对着阿齐拉费尔微笑。“那么，再见。”

Before Anthony stepped up to the portal, Crowley called out, “Hey, Other-Me!” Anthony paused, one fine eyebrow raised. “Let’s get a drink sometime, yeah?”  
安东尼走向传送门之前，克劳利喊道：“嘿，另一个我！”安东尼停下来，一只修长的眉毛微微挑起。“我们什么时候一起喝一杯，好吗？”

The Other-Him huffed a laugh. “Sure.”  
另一个他嗤笑一声，“当然。”

Then he stepped through the portal. With a single clap of his hands, Adam closed it like he was turning off a lamp. Beside him, Aziraphale let out a slow breath.   
然后他穿过了传送门。亚当用一声掌声将其关闭，就像他关闭一盏灯一样。在他身旁，阿齐拉费尔缓缓地呼出一口气。

Crowley tucked an arm around him. “Hey, why don’t we go to the Ritz tonight?”  
克劳利搂住他的胳膊。“嘿，我们今晚为什么不去丽兹酒店呢？”

Aziraphale, as expected, lit up.   
阿齐拉费尔如预期般兴奋起来。

“That sounds lovely, dear.”  
“亲爱的，听起来很美好。”

\-

They had finally done it. They met their Adam, who truly was human incarnate even without their influences. They saved the Earth.  
他们终于做到了。他们遇到了他们的亚当，一个真正的人类化身，即使没有他们的影响也是如此。他们拯救了地球。

And now Anthony wanted to sleep for an eternity.   
现在安东尼想要永远地睡觉。

They came back to Anthony’s off-white minimalist apartment - “It looks so bland, dear,” - he watered his plants with a robotic routine, the heavy weight of their long day making him feel on the verge of collapsing.   
他们回到了安东尼的米白色极简公寓。“亲爱的，看起来太单调了。”他机械地给植物浇水，长时间的劳累让他感觉快要崩溃了。

With the excitement of everything, it was easy to forget falling into strange openings into other universes, ones where things are very different yet very similar. Anthony would pin that under ‘Facing Down Satan’ on a list of Insane Ways to Spend the Day.   
在一切的兴奋中，很容易忘记掉落到其他宇宙的奇怪洞口中，那些地方与现实非常不同，却又非常相似。安东尼会将这归类为“面对撒旦”清单上的疯狂度过一天的方式之一。

Anthony set aside his mister and leaned his elbows on a kitchen counter, letting out a slow, steady breath. He felt a presence behind him before a gentle hand pressed between his shoulders.   
安东尼把先生放在一边，将手肘靠在厨房柜台上，缓缓地吐出一口气。他感觉到身后有个人的存在，然后一只温柔的手轻轻按在他的肩膀上。

“Would you like to sleep, my dear?” Azirafell offered. He appeared as drawn-out as Anthony did. Still, there was a determined upturn of his lips. “We can talk in the morning.”   
“亲爱的，你想睡觉吗？”阿齐拉费尔提议道。他看起来和安东尼一样疲惫不堪。然而，他的嘴角却带着坚定的微笑。“我们可以明天早上再聊。”

Anthony weakly shook his head. “We have to figure out what the prophecy means.” He reached into his pocket to pull out the crumpled piece of paper, a piece he snagged from Agnes Nutter’s Book of Prophecies.   
安东尼无力地摇了摇头。“我们必须弄清楚预言的意思。”他伸手从口袋里掏出一张皱巴巴的纸，这是他从阿格尼丝·纳特的预言书中偷来的一张纸。

_Choose your faces wisely_ . What were they supposed to do with that?  
明智地选择你的面孔。他们应该怎么办呢？

“We can do it tomorrow,” Azirafell said, sliding a tempting hand over Anthony’s elbow. “Let’s get to bed.”   
“明天我们可以做这件事，”阿齐拉费尔说着，一只诱人的手悄悄滑过安东尼的肘部。“我们去睡觉吧。”

“You don’t sleep, fiend.”   
你不睡觉，恶魔。

“No. But I do believe a nap is overdue.”   
不过我确实觉得该打个盹了。

Anthony hesitated a moment longer before finally caving. That had been getting easier to do over the last few years. Azirafell lead him through the flat and to Anthony’s bedroom. White silk sheets, a pink overthrow at the base of the bed, feathered pillows, and black-out curtains - that unfortunately disrupted the flat’s aesthetic, but Anthony could do little about it - were key components Anthony discovered in the art of sleep.   
安东尼犹豫了片刻，最终屈服了。这在过去几年里变得越来越容易。阿齐拉费尔带着他穿过公寓，来到安东尼的卧室。白色丝绸床单，床尾的粉色覆盖物，羽绒枕头和遮光窗帘——虽然不幸地破坏了公寓的美感，但安东尼对此无能为力——这些都是安东尼在睡眠艺术中发现的关键要素。

He flopped down on top of the covers once he was close enough. Azirafell huffed a laugh somewhere behind him before settling on the opposite side. There was a snap, and Azirafell was dressed in old-fashioned dark blue nightgown. Anthony hid his eye roll behind the duvet.   
一靠近，他就瘫倒在被子上。阿齐拉费尔在他身后咯咯笑了一声，然后坐在对面。突然一声响，阿齐拉费尔穿上了一件古老的深蓝色睡袍。安东尼把他的翻白眼藏在被子后面。

Once they were each settled on opposite sides of the bed, Anthony didn’t allow himself to give in to the desperation clinging to the back of his mind. He had already done that once, with a different Azirafell, and he wasn’t about to make the same mistake twice.   
一旦他们各自安顿在床的两侧，安东尼不允许自己屈服于心底的绝望。他曾经这样做过一次，与另一个阿齐拉费尔，他不打算再犯同样的错误。

Still, it seemed Azirafell wasn’t ready to call it a night.   
然而，似乎阿齐拉费尔还没有准备好结束这个夜晚。

“Are you going to take up the Other-You on his offer?”  
你打算接受另一个你的提议吗？

Anthony stared up at the ceiling, his hands locked together on his stomach. “Dunno. Why?”  
安东尼仰望着天花板，双手交叉放在肚子上。“不知道。为什么？”

“Because I’ll probably tag along if you do,” Azirafell said. “I would love to hear more of Crowley’s stories. So much like us, but so different at the same time!”  
“因为如果你去的话，我可能会跟着去，”亚齐拉费尔说。“我很想听克劳利的故事。他们与我们如此相似，但又如此不同！”

The statement abruptly reminded Anthony of his own complicated feelings towards the Other-Azirafell. A bitterness rose with him.   
这个陈述突然让安东尼想起了他对于另一个阿齐拉费尔的复杂感情。一股苦涩涌上心头。

“Is he that interesting?” He couldn’t help muttering.   
“他那么有趣吗？”他忍不住嘀咕道。

There was a pause. Then, a shifting beside Anthony.   
有一段停顿。然后，安东尼旁边有一丝动静。

“My dear,” Azirafell said, voice closer than before. “No one can replace you.”   
“亲爱的，”亚齐拉费尔的声音比之前更近了。“没有人能取代你。”

Relief made Anthony’s tense shoulders sag, a warmth in his chest he always felt in moments like this. Then it was soured by a wave of guilt as he remembered just how willing he was to replace the one person who meant everything to him.   
松了一口气，安东尼感觉紧绷的肩膀松弛下来，胸腔里涌起一股温暖，这种感觉他在这样的时刻总是会有。然而，一股罪恶感随即涌上心头，他想起自己是多么愿意取代那个对他来说意义非凡的人。

Wordlessly, he rolled over and slung an arm around Azirafell. The demon stiffened beneath his touch. Anthony expected a soft shove, maybe a playful jab, and for them to go back to pretending that there was nothing between them. It was how things usually played out.   
他默默地翻身过来，将一只手搭在阿齐拉费尔身上。恶魔在他的触碰下僵硬了一下。安东尼预料着会有轻轻的推开，或者玩笑般的戳一下，然后他们会继续假装彼此之间没有什么。这通常是事情的发展方式。

But instead, he felt a hesitant hand at the base of his neck, gentle fingers sliding through short hair. Gradually, the tension lifted as they sagged into each other.   
但是，相反，他感到一只犹豫的手放在他脖子的底部，温柔的手指穿过短发。随着彼此的倾斜，紧张逐渐消散。

Anthony thought that was the end of their conversation when Azirafell spoke again.   
安东尼以为他们的对话就此结束，但阿齐拉费尔又开口了。

“That was a clever trick you did,” Azirafell said, soft. “Back in the other universe. I know I was mad at the time, but I’m sure you did them a huge favor.”   
“你刚才那个聪明的把戏真是厉害，”亚齐拉费尔轻声说道，“在另一个宇宙里。我知道当时我很生气，但我相信你给他们带来了巨大的帮助。”

Anthony shrugged. “We can only hope that it’ll keep them safe. Heaven isn’t easily deterred.”   
安东尼耸了耸肩。“我们只能希望它能保护他们安全。天堂不会轻易被阻挡。”

“Neither is Hell. But a young boy just told off Satan today, so I think anything’s possible.”   
“地狱也不是。但是今天一个小男孩刚刚敢于对撒旦说不，所以我觉得一切皆有可能。”

“If only I could use my status against Heaven like that again,” Anthony wondered aloud. He chuckled, then added, “Maybe I could convince Crowley to come take whatever punishment Heaven is preparing for me. Give them a run for their money.”   
“要是我能再次像那样对抗天堂就好了。”安东尼大声疑惑地说道。他笑了笑，接着补充道：“也许我能说服克劳利来承受天堂为我准备的任何惩罚。让他们付出代价。”

Azirafell didn’t respond, so Anthony looked up at him. He had that tight, thoughtful expression as if mulling over a difficult puzzle. As Anthony watched, Azirafell’s face lit up with an epiphany.   
亚齐拉费尔没有回应，于是安东尼抬头看着他。他脸上带着紧绷而深思的表情，仿佛在琢磨一个棘手的难题。安东尼看着，亚齐拉费尔的脸上突然闪现出一丝顿悟的光芒。

“ _Choose your faces wisely_ ,” He murmured. “What if that’s what the prophecy is talking about?”  
“明智地选择你的面孔，”他低声说道。“如果这就是预言所说的呢？”

“Have Crowley and Aziraphale take our places?” He wasn’t too keen on going to visit them again quite so soon.   
“让克劳利和阿齐拉费尔代替我们去？” 他对再次去拜访他们并不太感兴趣。

But Azirafell shook his head. “Not exactly that, no. You swapped with Crowley to trick Gabriel. What if _we_ swap instead?”  
但是阿齐拉费尔摇了摇头。“不完全是那样，不。你和克劳利交换身份是为了欺骗加百利。如果我们来交换呢？”

Anthony blinked. Then he sat up, snapping his fingers to turn on the table lamp. He faced Azirafell with an almost manic grin.   
安东尼眨了眨眼睛。然后他坐起来，用手指弹了一下，打开了台灯。他面带狂热的笑容，对着阿齐拉费尔说道。

“You, fiend, are a _genius_ .”   
你这个恶魔，真是个天才。
