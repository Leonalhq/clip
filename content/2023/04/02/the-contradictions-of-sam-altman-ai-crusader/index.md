Sam Altman, the 37-year-old startup-minting guru at the forefront of the [artificial intelligence boom](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-chatgpt-chatbot-workplace-call-centers-5cd2142a?mod=article_inline), has long dreamed of a future in which computers could converse and learn like humans.  

萨姆-奥特曼（Sam Altman），这位37岁的创业大师处于人工智能热潮的最前沿，长期以来一直梦想着一个计算机能够像人类一样交谈和学习的未来。

One of his clearest childhood memories is sitting up late in his bedroom in suburban St. Louis, playing with the Macintosh LC II he had gotten for his eighth birthday when he had the sudden realization: “Someday, the computer was going to learn to think,” he said.  

他最清晰的童年记忆之一是在圣路易斯郊区的卧室里熬夜，玩他8岁生日时得到的Macintosh LC II，当时他突然意识到："他说："有一天，计算机将学会思考。

In recent months, Mr. Altman has done more than anyone else to usher in this future—and commercialize it. OpenAI, the company he leads, in November released [ChatGPT](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chatgpt-ai-chatbot-app-explained-11675865177?mod=article_inline), the chatbot with an [uncanny ability](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chatgpt-wrote-my-ap-english-essayand-i-passed-11671628256?mod=article_inline) to produce humanlike writing that has become one of the most viral products in the history of technology. In the process, OpenAI went from a small nonprofit into a [multibillion-dollar company](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chatgpt-creator-openai-is-in-talks-for-tender-offer-that-would-value-it-at-29-billion-11672949279?mod=article_inline), at near record speed, thanks in part to the launch of a for-profit arm that enabled it to raise $13 billion from [Microsoft](https://quotes.wsj.com/MSFT) Corp. , according to investor documents.   

近几个月来，阿特曼先生为开创这一未来所做的工作比任何人都多，而且还将其商业化。他领导的公司OpenAI于11月发布了ChatGPT，该聊天机器人具有产生类似人类文字的惊人能力，已成为技术史上最具病毒性的产品之一。在这个过程中，OpenAI从一个小的非营利组织变成了一个价值数十亿美元的公司，其速度几乎是创纪录的，部分原因是启动了一个营利性部门，使其能够从微软公司筹集130亿美元。 根据投资者的文件，OpenAI从一个小的非营利组织变成了一个价值数十亿美元的公司。

This success has come as part of a delicate balancing act. Mr. Altman said he fears what could happen if AI is rolled out into society recklessly. He co-founded OpenAI eight years ago as a research nonprofit, arguing that it’s uniquely dangerous to have profits be the main driver of developing powerful AI models.  

这种成功是作为一种微妙的平衡行为的一部分而出现的。阿特曼先生说，他担心如果不顾一切地将人工智能推广到社会中会发生什么。他在八年前作为一个研究性非营利组织共同创立了OpenAI，认为让利润成为开发强大人工智能模型的主要驱动力是非常危险的。

He is so wary of profit as an incentive in AI development that he has taken no direct financial stake in the business he built, he said—an anomaly in Silicon Valley, where founders of successful startups typically get rich off their equity.   

他对利润作为人工智能发展的激励因素如此警惕，以至于他没有在自己建立的企业中直接获得经济利益，他说--这在硅谷是一个反常现象，在那里，成功的初创企业的创始人通常会通过股权获得财富。

“Like most other people, I like watching scores go up,” when it comes to financial gains, he said. “And I just like not having that be any factor at all.” (The company said he earns a “modest” salary, but declined to disclose how much.) Mr. Altman said he has a small stake in a venture fund that invested in OpenAI, but that it is “immaterial.”  

"像其他大多数人一样，我喜欢看着分数上升，"当涉及到经济收益时，他说。"而我只是喜欢完全没有这个因素。"(该公司说他的工资 "不高"，但拒绝透露具体数额）。奥特曼先生说，他在一个投资于OpenAI的风险基金中拥有少量股份，但这 "并不重要"。

Mr. Altman said he made “more money than I could ever need” early in his career, when he made a fortune investing in young startups. He owns three homes, including a mansion in San Francisco’s Russian Hill neighborhood and a weekend home in Napa Valley, and employs a couple dozen to manage them and his family office of investments and nonprofits.   

阿特曼先生说，在他职业生涯的早期，他在投资年轻的创业公司时赚了不少钱，"比我需要的还多"。他拥有三处房产，包括位于旧金山俄罗斯山社区的一处豪宅和位于纳帕谷的一处周末住宅，并雇用了几十名员工管理这些房子和他的投资和非营利性家族办公室。

During one of his last visits to his grandmother, who died last year, he bought her groceries and then admitted to his mother that he hadn’t been to a grocery store in four or five years, she said.  

在他最后一次探望去年去世的祖母时，他给她买了杂货，然后向他的母亲承认，他已经四、五年没有去过杂货店了，她说。

His goal, he said, is to forge a new world order in which machines free people to pursue more creative work. In his vision, universal basic income—the concept of a cash stipend for everyone, no strings attached—helps compensate for jobs replaced by AI. Mr. Altman even thinks that humanity will love AI so much that an advanced chatbot could represent “an extension of your will.”  

他说，他的目标是建立一个新的世界秩序，让机器解放人们去追求更有创造性的工作。在他的设想中，全民基本收入--即为每个人提供现金津贴的概念，不附带任何条件--有助于补偿被人工智能取代的工作。阿特曼先生甚至认为，人类将如此热爱人工智能，以至于一个先进的聊天机器人可以代表 "你意志的延伸"。

In the long run, he said, he wants to set up a global governance structure that would oversee decisions about the future of AI and gradually reduce the power OpenAI’s executive team has over its technology.   

他说，从长远来看，他希望建立一个全球治理结构，监督有关人工智能未来的决策，并逐步减少OpenAI的执行团队对其技术的权力。

Backers say his brand of social-minded capitalism makes him the ideal person to lead OpenAI. Others, including some who’ve worked for him, say he’s too commercially minded and immersed in Silicon Valley thinking to lead a technological revolution that is already reshaping business and social life.   

支持者说他的社会意识资本主义品牌使他成为领导OpenAI的理想人选。其他人，包括一些曾为他工作过的人，说他的商业意识太强，沉浸在硅谷的思维中，无法领导一场已经在重塑商业和社会生活的技术革命。

The company signed a $10 billion deal with Microsoft in January that would allow the tech behemoth to own 49% of the company’s for-profit entity, investor documents show. The corporate partnership, along with Mr. Altman’s push to more aggressively commercialize its technology, have disillusioned key early leaders at OpenAI who felt the decisions violated an initial commitment to develop AI outside the influence of shareholders.  

投资者文件显示，该公司在1月份与微软签署了一项100亿美元的交易，允许这个科技巨头拥有该公司盈利实体的49%的股权。这种企业合作关系，以及奥特曼先生推动其技术更积极地商业化，使OpenAI的早期主要领导人感到失望，他们认为这些决定违反了最初的承诺，即在股东的影响之外开发人工智能。

One of OpenAI’s critics has been [Elon Musk](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/elon-musk), who co-founded the nonprofit in 2015 but parted ways in 2018 after a dispute over its control and direction. The  

埃隆-马斯克是OpenAI的批评者之一，他在2015年共同创立了这个非营利组织，但在2018年因控制权和方向问题发生争议而分道扬镳。马斯克

[Tesla](https://quotes.wsj.com/TSLA) Inc. CEO [tweeted in February](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1626516035863212034) that OpenAI had been founded as an open-source nonprofit “to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft. Not what I intended at all.”  

特斯拉公司。 首席执行官在2月份发推文说，OpenAI是作为一个开源的非营利组织成立的，"作为对谷歌的制衡，但现在它已经成为一个封闭的、最大利润的公司，实际上被微软控制。这完全不是我的初衷"。

Mr. Altman paused when asked about his co-founder’s critique. “I like Elon,” he finally responded. “I pay attention to what he has to say.”  

当被问及他的联合创始人的批评时，奥特曼先生停顿了一下。"我喜欢伊隆，"他最后回答。"我关注他说的话。"

In an open letter made public this week, Mr. Musk and other Silicon Valley luminaries, including [Apple](https://quotes.wsj.com/AAPL) Inc. co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for a [six-month pause](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-other-ai-bigwigs-call-for-pause-in-technologys-development-56327f?mod=article_inline) for developing AI more advanced than GPT-4, the latest technology released by OpenAI in March, to stem a technological race that could spiral out of control.   

在本周公开的一封公开信中，马斯克先生和其他硅谷名人，包括苹果公司联合创始人史蒂夫-沃兹尼亚克，呼吁暂停开发比GPT-4（OpenAI在3月发布的最新技术）更先进的人工智能，以阻止可能失去控制的技术竞赛。

Mr. Altman said he doesn’t necessarily need to be first to develop artificial general intelligence, a world long imagined by researchers and science-fiction writers where software isn’t just good at one specific task like generating text or images but can understand and learn as well or better than a human can. He instead said OpenAI’s ultimate mission is to build AGI, as it’s called, safely.   

阿特曼先生说，他不一定要成为开发人工通用智能的第一人，这是一个研究人员和科幻小说作家长期以来想象的世界，在这个世界里，软件不仅仅擅长一项具体的任务，如生成文本或图像，而且能够理解和学习，甚至比人类更出色。相反，他说OpenAI的最终使命是安全地建立所谓的AGI。

OpenAI has set profit caps for investors, with any returns beyond certain levels—from seven to 100 times what they put in, depending on how early they invested—flowing to the nonprofit parent, according to investor documents. OpenAI and Microsoft also created a joint safety board, which includes Mr. Altman and Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott, that has the power to roll back Microsoft and OpenAI product releases if they are deemed too dangerous.   

根据投资者文件，OpenAI为投资者设定了利润上限，任何超过一定水平的回报--从他们投入的7倍到100倍不等，取决于他们的投资时间，都将流向非营利性母公司。OpenAI和微软还成立了一个联合安全委员会，其中包括奥特曼先生和微软首席技术官凯文-斯科特，如果微软和OpenAI发布的产品被认为过于危险，该委员会有权收回。

The possibilities of AGI have led Mr. Altman to entertain the idea that some similar technology created our universe, according to billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel, a close friend of Mr. Altman’s and an early donor to the nonprofit. He has long been a proponent of the idea that humans and machines will one day merge.  

据亿万富翁风险资本家彼得-泰尔（Peter Thiel）说，AGI的可能性使奥特曼先生产生了这样的想法：一些类似的技术创造了我们的宇宙，他是奥特曼先生的密友，也是该非营利组织的早期捐助者。长期以来，他一直是人类和机器有一天会融合的想法的支持者。

ChatGPT’s release triggered a stream of competing AI announcements.   

ChatGPT的发布引发了一连串竞争性的人工智能公告。

“They’ve raced to release press releases,” Mr. Altman said of his competitors. “Obviously, they’re behind now.” Google announced it was testing its own chatbot, Bard, in February and opened access to the public in March.   

"他们已经争先恐后地发布新闻稿，"奥特曼先生在谈到他的竞争对手时说。"很明显，他们现在已经落后了。"谷歌在2月份宣布它正在测试自己的聊天机器人Bard，并在3月份向公众开放访问。

In its founding charter, OpenAI pledged to abandon its research efforts if another project came close to building AGI before it did. The goal, the company said, was to avoid a race toward building dangerous AI systems fueled by competition and instead prioritize the safety of humanity.  

在其成立章程中，OpenAI承诺，如果有其他项目在它之前接近建立AGI，它将放弃其研究工作。该公司表示，其目标是避免在竞争的推动下建立危险的人工智能系统，而是将人类的安全放在首位。

OpenAI’s headquarters, in San Francisco’s Mission District, evoke an affluent New Age utopia more than a nonprofit trying to save the world. Stone fountains are nestled amid succulents and ferns in nearly all of the sun-soaked rooms.   

OpenAI的总部位于旧金山的Mission区，与其说是一个试图拯救世界的非营利组织，不如说是一个富裕的新时代乌托邦。在几乎所有沐浴在阳光下的房间里，石制喷泉都依偎在多肉植物和蕨类植物中间。

Mr. Altman gushes about the winding, central staircase he conceived so that all 400 of the company’s employees would have a chance to pass each other daily—or at least on the Mondays through Wednesdays they are required to work in-person. The office includes a college-style cafeteria, a self-serve bar and a library modeled after a combination of his favorite bookstore in Paris and the Bender Room, a quiet study space on the top floor of Stanford University’s largest library.   

阿特曼先生对他构思的蜿蜒的中央楼梯赞不绝口，这样公司的400名员工每天都有机会互相交流，或者至少在他们需要亲自工作的周一到周三是这样。办公室包括一个大学风格的食堂、一个自助酒吧和一个图书馆，其模式是将他在巴黎最喜欢的书店和斯坦福大学最大的图书馆顶层的安静学习空间Bender Room相结合。

Dressed in the typical tech CEO uniform of a gray hoodie, jeans and blindingly white sneakers, Mr. Altman described a much more modest upbringing.   

阿特曼先生穿着典型的科技界CEO制服，灰色连帽衫、牛仔裤和刺眼的白色运动鞋，他描述了一个更为谦逊的成长经历。

Mr. Altman grew up in a suburb of St. Louis, the eldest of four children born to Connie Gibstine, a dermatologist, and Jerry Altman, who worked various jobs, including as a lawyer, and died five years ago. The senior Mr. Altman’s true vocation was running affordable housing nonprofits, his family said, and he spent years trying to revitalize St. Louis’s downtown.  

阿特曼先生在聖路易郊區長大，是皮膚科醫生康妮-吉布斯廷和傑瑞-阿特曼所生四個孩子中的長子，傑瑞-阿特曼曾做過各種工作，包括律師，五年前去世。他的家人说，老阿特曼先生真正的职业是经营经济适用房的非营利组织，他花了多年时间试图振兴圣路易斯的市中心。

Among the lessons his father taught him, Mr. Altman said, was that “you always help people—even if you don’t think you have time, you figure it out.”  

阿特曼先生说，他父亲教给他的经验之一是，"你总是帮助别人--即使你认为自己没有时间，你也要想办法。"

Dr. Gibstine said her son was working the family’s VCR at age 2 and rebooking his own plane ticket home from camp at 13. By the time he was in third grade, he was helping teachers at his local public school troubleshoot computer problems, she said. In middle school, he transferred to the private John Burroughs School.  

Gibstine博士说，她的儿子在2岁时就开始操作家里的录像机，13岁时就自己从营地重新订机票回家。她说，在他三年级的时候，他已经在当地的公立学校帮助老师解决电脑问题了。初中时，他转到了私立的约翰-巴勒斯学校。

“Teachers liked him because he was really, really bright and a hard worker, but he was also super social,” said Andy Abbott, the head of school, who was a principal at the time. “He was funny and had a big personality.”  

"老师们喜欢他，因为他真的非常聪明，是个勤奋的人，但他也超级善于社交，"当时担任校长的校长安迪-阿伯特说。"他很风趣，有很大的个性。"

Mr. Altman went on to Stanford, where he did research at an AI lab. By sophomore year he had co-founded Loopt, a location-based social networking service. It became part of the first class of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator that went on to hatch companies like [Airbnb](https://quotes.wsj.com/ABNB) Inc., Stripe Inc. and [Dropbox](https://quotes.wsj.com/DBX) Inc., and Mr. Altman left school.   

阿特曼先生进入了斯坦福大学，在那里他在一个人工智能实验室做研究。大二时，他与人合作创办了Loopt，这是一个基于位置的社交网络服务。这家公司成为Y Combinator的第一期学员，Y Combinator是一个创业加速器，后来孵化出了Airbnb公司、Stripe公司和Dropbox公司等公司，Altman先生离开了学校。

Loopt never got traction, selling in 2012 for $43.4 million, or close to the amount investors including Sequoia Capital put in.   

Loopt从未获得牵引力，2012年以4340万美元的价格出售，或接近包括红杉资本在内的投资者投入的金额。

Mr. Altman then started a venture fund and made powerful allies, including Mr. Thiel and Paul Graham, who co-founded Y Combinator and eventually brought on Mr. Altman. There he helped build the company into a Silicon Valley power broker. He invested his own money in dozens of successful companies early on, including cloud software company [Asana](https://quotes.wsj.com/ASAN) Inc. and message-board site Reddit Inc.   

阿特曼先生随后创办了一个风险基金，并结交了强大的盟友，包括泰尔先生和保罗-格雷厄姆，他们共同创办了Y Combinator，并最终邀请了阿特曼先生。在那里，他帮助该公司建立了一个硅谷的权力经纪人。他很早就用自己的钱投资了几十家成功的公司，包括云计算软件公司Asana Inc.和消息板网站Reddit Inc.

While running Y Combinator, Mr. Altman began to nurse a growing fear that large research labs like DeepMind, purchased by Google in 2014, were creating potentially dangerous AI technologies outside the public eye. Mr. Musk has voiced similar concerns of a dystopian world controlled by powerful AI machines.   

在经营Y Combinator期间，奥特曼先生开始越来越担心，像2014年被谷歌收购的DeepMind这样的大型研究实验室，正在公众视线之外创造潜在的危险人工智能技术。马斯克先生也表达了对一个由强大的人工智能机器控制的二元世界的类似担忧。

Messrs. Altman and Musk decided it was time to start their own lab. Both were part of a group that pledged $1 billion to the nonprofit, OpenAI Inc.   

奥特曼和马斯克先生决定是时候创办自己的实验室了。两人都是向非营利组织OpenAI Inc.认捐10亿美元的团体的一员。

Mr. Musk didn’t respond to requests for comment.   

马斯克先生没有对置评请求作出回应。

The nonprofit meandered in its early years, experimenting with projects like teaching robots how to perform tasks like solving Rubik’s Cubes. OpenAI laid off a chunk of its small staff in 2017.   

这个非营利组织在其早期几年里一直徘徊不前，尝试过一些项目，比如教机器人如何完成解魔方等任务。2017年，OpenAI解雇了一大批员工。

OpenAI researchers soon concluded that the most promising path to achieve artificial general intelligence rested in large language models, or computer programs that mimic the way humans read and write. Such models were trained on large volumes of text and required a massive amount of computing power that OpenAI wasn’t equipped to fund as a nonprofit, according to Mr. Altman.   

OpenAI的研究人员很快得出结论，实现人工通用智能的最有希望的途径在于大型语言模型，或模仿人类阅读和写作方式的计算机程序。据奥特曼先生说，这种模型是在大量的文本中训练出来的，需要大量的计算能力，而OpenAI作为一个非营利组织并不具备这种能力。

“We didn’t have a visceral sense of just how expensive this project was going to be,” he said. “We still don’t.”  

"我们对这个项目将有多昂贵没有直观的感觉，"他说。"我们仍然没有。"

That year, Mr. Altman said he looked into options to raise more money for OpenAI, such as securing federal funding and launching a new cryptocurrency. “No one wanted to fund this in any way,” he said. “It was a really hard time.”   

那一年，奥特曼先生说，他研究了为OpenAI筹集更多资金的方案，比如获得联邦资金和推出一种新的加密货币。他说："没有人愿意以任何方式为其提供资金，"他说。"那是一个非常艰难的时期。"

Tensions also grew with Mr. Musk, who became frustrated with the slow progress and pushed for more control over the organization, people familiar with the matter said.   

熟悉此事的人士说，马斯克先生的关系也越来越紧张，他对进展缓慢感到沮丧，并要求对该组织进行更多控制。

OpenAI executives ended up reviving an unusual idea that had been floated earlier in the company’s history: creating a for-profit arm, OpenAI LP, that would report to the nonprofit parent.   

OpenAI的高管们最终恢复了一个在公司历史上较早时候提出的不同寻常的想法：创建一个营利性的部门，OpenAI LP，向非营利性的母公司汇报。

Reid Hoffman, a LinkedIn co-founder who advised OpenAI at the time and later served on the board, said the idea was to attract investors eager to make money from the commercial release of some OpenAI technology, accelerating OpenAI’s progress.   

当时为OpenAI提供咨询、后来担任董事会成员的LinkedIn联合创始人Reid Hoffman说，这个想法是为了吸引急于从OpenAI一些技术的商业发布中赚钱的投资者，加速OpenAI的进展。

“You want to be there first and you want to be setting the norms,” he said. “That’s part of the reason why speed is a moral and ethical thing here.”  

"你想先到那里，你想制定规范，"他说。"这就是为什么速度在这里是一个道德和伦理问题的部分原因。"

The decision further alienated Mr. Musk, the people familiar with the matter said. He parted ways with OpenAI in February 2018.   

熟悉此事的人士说，这一决定进一步疏远了马斯克先生。他于2018年2月与OpenAI分道扬镳。

Mr. Musk announced his departure in a company all-hands, former employees who attended the meeting said. Mr. Musk explained that he thought he had a better chance at creating artificial general intelligence through Tesla, where he had access to greater resources, they said.  

参加会议的前雇员说，马斯克先生在公司全体员工会议上宣布了他的离职。他们说，马斯克先生解释说，他认为通过特斯拉，他有更好的机会创造人工通用智能，在那里他可以获得更多资源。

A young researcher questioned whether Mr. Musk had thought through the safety implications, the former employees said. Mr. Musk grew visibly frustrated and called the intern a “jackass,” leaving employees stunned, they said. It was the last time many of them would see Mr. Musk in person.    

前雇员说，一名年轻的研究人员质疑马斯克先生是否考虑到了安全问题。马斯克先生明显感到沮丧，并称这名实习生为 "蠢货"，员工们都惊呆了，他们说。这是他们中许多人最后一次见到马斯克先生本人。

Soon after, an OpenAI executive commissioned a “jackass” trophy for the young researcher, which was later presented to him on a pillow. “You’ve got to have a little fun,” Mr. Altman said. “This is the stuff that culture gets made out of.”  

不久之后，OpenAI的一位高管为这位年轻的研究人员定制了一个 "傻瓜 "奖杯，后来被放在一个枕头上送给了他。"阿特曼先生说："你必须要有一点乐趣。"这就是文化所产生的东西。"

Mr. Musk’s departure marked a turning point. Later that year, OpenAI leaders told employees that Mr. Altman was set to lead the company. He formally became CEO and helped complete the creation of the for-profit subsidiary in early 2019.  

马斯克先生的离开标志着一个转折点。当年晚些时候，OpenAI领导人告诉员工，奥特曼先生将领导该公司。他正式成为CEO，并帮助在2019年初完成了营利性子公司的创建。

OpenAI said that it received about $130 million in contributions from the initial $1 billion pledge, but that further donations were no longer needed after the for-profit’s creation. Mr. Musk has tweeted that he donated around $100 million to OpenAI.   

OpenAI表示，它从最初的10亿美元认捐中收到了约1.3亿美元的捐款，但在这家营利性公司成立后不再需要进一步的捐款。马斯克先生曾在推特上表示，他向OpenAI捐赠了约1亿美元。

In the meantime, Mr. Altman began hunting for investors. His break came at Allen & Co.’s annual conference in Sun Valley, Idaho in the summer of 2018, where he bumped into Satya Nadella, the Microsoft CEO, on a stairwell and pitched him on OpenAI. Mr. Nadella said he was intrigued. The conversations picked up that winter.  

在此期间，奥特曼先生开始寻找投资者。2018年夏天，他在爱达荷州太阳谷举行的艾伦公司(Allen & Co.)年会上获得了突破，他在楼梯间碰到了微软首席执行官萨提亚-纳德拉(Satya Nadella)，并向他介绍了OpenAI。纳德拉先生说他很感兴趣。那年冬天，双方的对话开始了。

“I remember coming back to the team after and I was like, this is the only partner,” Mr. Altman said. “They get the safety stuff, they get artificial general intelligence. They have the capital, they have the ability to run the compute.”     

"我记得之后回到团队，我想，这是唯一的合作伙伴，"奥特曼先生说。"他们得到了安全的东西，他们得到了人工通用智能。他们有资本，他们有运行计算的能力。"

Mr. Altman shared the contract with employees as it was being negotiated, hosting all-hands and office hours to allay concerns that the partnership contradicted OpenAI’s initial pledge to develop artificial intelligence outside the corporate world, the former employees said.   

前雇员说，在合同谈判过程中，奥特曼先生与员工分享了合同，举办了全员会议和办公时间，以消除人们对这种合作关系与OpenAI最初承诺的在企业界以外开发人工智能相矛盾的担忧。

Some employees still saw the deal as a Faustian bargain.   

一些员工仍然认为这笔交易是一个浮士德式的交易。

OpenAI’s lead safety researcher, Dario Amodei, and his lieutenants feared the deal would allow Microsoft to sell products using powerful OpenAI technology before it was put through enough safety testing, former employees said. They felt that OpenAI’s technology was far from ready for a large release—let alone with one of the world’s largest software companies—worrying it could malfunction or be misused for harm in ways they couldn’t predict.    

前雇员说，OpenAI的首席安全研究员达里奥-阿莫代(Dario Amodei)和他的副手们担心，这笔交易会让微软在对OpenAI的技术进行足够的安全测试之前就出售使用该技术的产品。他们认为，OpenAI的技术远未准备好进行大规模发布，更不用说与世界上最大的软件公司之一合作了，他们担心它可能出现故障或被滥用，造成他们无法预测的伤害。

Mr. Amodei also worried the deal would tether OpenAI’s ship to just one company—Microsoft—making it more difficult for OpenAI to stay true to its founding charter’s commitment to assist another project if it got to AGI first, the former employees said.  

前雇员说，阿莫代先生还担心这笔交易会把OpenAI的船只拴在一家公司--微软--这使得OpenAI更难忠于其创始章程中的承诺，即如果它首先得到AGI的帮助，就会协助另一个项目。

Microsoft initially invested $1 billion in OpenAI. While the deal gave OpenAI its needed money, it came with a hitch: exclusivity. OpenAI agreed to only use Microsoft’s giant computer servers, via its Azure cloud service, to train its AI models, and to give the tech giant the sole right to license OpenAI’s technology for future products.   

微软最初向OpenAI投资了10亿美元。虽然这笔交易给了OpenAI所需的资金，但也带来了一个麻烦：排他性。OpenAI同意只使用微软的巨型计算机服务器，通过其Azure云服务来训练其人工智能模型，并给予该科技巨头为未来产品授权OpenAI技术的唯一权利。

“You kind of have to jump off the cliff and hope you land,” Mr. Nadella said in a recent interview. “That’s kind of how platform shifts happen.”  

"纳德拉先生在最近的一次采访中说："你必须跳下悬崖，希望你能落地。"这就是平台转变的方式。"

“The deal completely undermines those tenets to which they secured nonprofit status,” said Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor of psychology and neural science at New York University who co-founded a machine-learning company.   

"纽约大学心理学和神经科学荣誉教授加里-马库斯（Gary Marcus）说："这笔交易完全破坏了他们获得非营利性地位的那些原则，他是一家机器学习公司的共同创始人。

Mr. Altman “has presided over a 180-degree pivot that seems to me to be only giving lip service to concern for humanity,” he said.   

阿特曼先生 "主持了一个180度的转折，在我看来，这只是在口头上关心人类，"他说。

Mr. Altman disagreed. “The unusual thing about Microsoft as a partner is that it let us keep all the tenets that we think are important to our mission,” he said, including profit caps and the commitment to assist another project if it got to AGI first.   

阿特曼先生并不同意。他说："微软作为合作伙伴的不寻常之处在于，它让我们保留了所有我们认为对我们的任务很重要的信条，"他说，包括利润上限和承诺如果另一个项目首先得到AGI的帮助。

The cash turbocharged OpenAI’s progress, giving researchers access to the computing power needed to improve large language models, which were trained on billions of pages of publicly available text. OpenAI soon developed a more powerful language model called GPT-3 and then sold developers access to the technology in June 2020 through packaged lines of code known as application program interfaces, or APIs.   

这笔现金加速了OpenAI的进展，使研究人员能够获得改进大型语言模型所需的计算能力，这些模型是在数十亿页的公共可用文本上训练出来的。OpenAI很快开发了一个更强大的语言模型，称为GPT-3，然后在2020年6月通过被称为应用程序接口（API）的打包代码行向开发者出售对该技术的访问。

Mr. Altman and Mr. Amodei clashed again over the release of the API, former employees said. Mr. Amodei wanted a more limited and staged release of the product to help reduce publicity and allow the safety team to conduct more testing on a smaller group of users, former employees said.   

前雇员说，阿特曼和阿莫代在发布API的问题上再次发生冲突。前雇员说，阿莫代先生希望更有限地分阶段发布该产品，以帮助减少宣传，并允许安全团队在较小的用户群中进行更多的测试。

Mr. Amodei left the company a few months later along with several others to found a rival AI lab called Anthropic. “They had a different opinion about how to best get to safe AGI than we did,” Mr. Altman said.  

几个月后，阿莫代先生与其他几个人一起离开了公司，成立了一个名为Anthropic的竞争对手人工智能实验室。"阿特曼先生说："他们对如何最好地实现安全的AGI有不同的看法。

Anthropic has since received more than $300 million from Google this year and released its own AI chatbot called Claude in March, which is also available to developers through an API.   

此后，Anthropic今年从谷歌获得了超过3亿美元的资金，并在3月发布了自己的人工智能聊天机器人Claude，它也可以通过API向开发者提供。

In a recent investment deck, Anthropic said it was “committed to large-scale commercialization” to achieve the creation of safe AGI, and that it “fully committed” to a commercial approach in September. The company was founded as an AI safety and research company and said at the time that it might look to create commercial value from its products.   

在最近的一份投资说明书中，Anthropic表示，它 "致力于大规模商业化"，以实现创造安全的AGI，并在9月 "完全承诺 "采用商业方式。该公司是作为一家人工智能安全和研究公司成立的，当时说它可能会寻求从其产品中创造商业价值。

In the three years after the initial deal, Microsoft invested a total of $3 billion in OpenAI, according to investor documents.   

根据投资者文件，在最初交易后的三年里，微软共向OpenAI投资了30亿美元。

More than one million users signed up for ChatGPT within five days of its November release, a speed that surprised even Mr. Altman. It followed the company’s introduction of [DALL-E 2](https://www.wsj.com/articles/think-of-any-image-then-ask-an-ai-art-generator-for-it-the-results-are-amazingand-terrifying-11666179308?mod=article_inline), which can generate sophisticated images from text prompts.  

ChatGPT在11月发布后的五天内就有超过一百万用户注册，这一速度甚至让奥特曼先生都感到惊讶。这是在该公司推出DALL-E 2之后发生的，它可以根据文本提示生成复杂的图像。

The internet blew up with anecdotes about people using ChatGPT to create sonnets or plan toddler birthday parties.  

互联网上炸开了锅，人们用ChatGPT创作十四行诗或计划幼儿生日派对的轶事层出不穷。

By February, it had reached 100 million users, according to analysts at UBS, the fastest pace by a consumer app in history to reach that mark.  

据瑞银的分析师称，到2月份，它的用户数已经达到了1亿，是历史上消费类应用达到这一标志的最快速度。

Mr. Altman’s close associates praise his ability to balance OpenAI’s priorities. No one better navigates between the “Scylla of misplaced idealism” and the “Charybdis of myopic ambition,” Mr. Thiel said.   

阿特曼先生的亲信赞扬了他平衡OpenAI优先事项的能力。没有人比他更能在 "错位的理想主义 "和 "近视的野心 "之间游刃有余了，泰尔先生说。

Mr. Altman said he delayed the release of the latest version of its model, GPT-4, from last year to March to run additional safety tests. Users had reported some disturbing experiences with the model, integrated into Bing, where the software hallucinated—meaning it made up answers to questions it didn’t know. It issued ominous warnings and made threats.   

阿特曼先生说，他将其模型的最新版本GPT-4的发布时间从去年推迟到3月，以进行更多的安全测试。用户报告了一些令人不安的使用该模型的经历，该模型被整合到Bing中，软件会产生幻觉--这意味着它对它不知道的问题编造答案。它发出不祥的警告并进行威胁。

“The way to get it right is to have people engage with it, explore these systems, study them, to learn how to make them safe,” Mr. Altman said.  

"阿特曼先生说："正确的方法是让人们参与其中，探索这些系统，研究它们，以学习如何使它们安全。

After Microsoft’s initial investment is paid back, it would capture 49% of OpenAI’s profits until the profit cap, up from 21% under prior arrangements, the documents show. OpenAI Inc., the nonprofit parent, would get the rest.   

文件显示，在微软的初始投资得到偿还后，它将获得OpenAI利润的49%，直到利润上限，而之前的安排是21%。非营利性母公司OpenAI公司将获得其余部分。

Mr. Altman’s other projects include Worldcoin, a company he co-founded that seeks to give cryptocurrency to every person on earth.   

阿特曼先生的其他项目包括世界币，这是他共同创办的一家公司，旨在为地球上的每个人提供加密货币。

He has put almost all his liquid wealth in recent years in two companies. He has put $375 million into Helion Energy, which is seeking to create carbon-free energy from nuclear fusion and is close to creating “legitimate net-gain energy in a real demo,” Mr. Altman said.  

近年来，他把几乎所有的流动财富都投入到两家公司。他向Helion能源公司投入了3.75亿美元，该公司正在寻求从核聚变中创造无碳能源，并接近于创造 "真正演示中的合法净收益能源"，奥特曼先生说。

He has also put $180 million into Retro, which aims to add 10 years to the human lifespan through “cellular reprogramming, plasma-inspired therapeutics and autophagy,” or the reuse of old and damaged cell parts, according to the company.   

他还向Retro公司投入了1.8亿美元，该公司旨在通过 "细胞重编程、血浆启发疗法和自噬"，或重新利用旧的和受损的细胞部分，使人类的寿命延长10年，据该公司称。

He noted how much easier these problems are, morally, than AI. “If you’re making nuclear fusion, it’s all upside. It’s just good,” he said. “If you’re making AI, it is potentially very good, potentially very terrible.”   

他指出，从道德上讲，这些问题比人工智能要容易得多。"如果你在做核聚变，这都是颠覆性的。它就是好的，"他说。"如果你在制造人工智能，它有可能非常好，也有可能非常可怕。"
