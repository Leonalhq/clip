Now, there's nothing wrong with a CLA – CAAs are much dodgier – but you're giving control of how other people can use your code in someone else's hands. For example, the reason we don't have an OpenSolaris today, even though Sun open sourced the code, was it used a CAA. When Oracle took over, they controlled all the copyrights and closed the code. That was it for OpenSolaris, although there is a fork, [illumos](https://www.illumos.org/), and related distros such as [OpenIndiana](https://www.openindiana.org/)
