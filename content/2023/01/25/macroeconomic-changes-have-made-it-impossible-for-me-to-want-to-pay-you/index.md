Amazon also began a fresh round of job cuts that are expected to eliminate more than 18,000 employees and become the largest workforce reduction in the e-retailer’s 28-year history.” — [CNBC, 1/18/23

Team,

There’s no easy way to say this: I have made the difficult decision to lay off over six thousand of you. In the past two years, we have achieved huge wins together. But unfortunately, the macroeconomic environment has shifted in ways none of us could have foreseen, from an economy in which I did feel like paying you, to one in which I’d rather not.  
这么说并不容易：我做出了艰难的决定，要裁掉你们六千多人。在过去的两年里，我们共同取得了巨大的胜利。但不幸的是，宏观经济环境已经以我们任何人都无法预见的方式发生了变化，从一种我确实想付钱给你的经济，转变为一种我不愿付钱给你的经济。

In 2021, things looked different. Interest rates were low, and my enthusiasm for bankrolling your children’s insulin was high. Given every available forecast, it was the perfect time to hire 1,200 blockchain developers, spin up original streaming content, and lead three rounds of funding for my nephew’s AI-powered B2B sourdough recipe app. Who could have known that in just a few months, despite all our operational velocity, the world would pivot so dramatically? Supply chains have stalled. Inflation has risen. And suddenly all your salaries and dental work hang like millstones chafing the supple neck of my stock compensation package.  
2021 年，情况看起来有所不同。利率很低，而我为你孩子的胰岛素提供资金的热情很高。鉴于所有可用的预测，现在是聘请 1,200 名区块链开发人员、启动原创流媒体内容并为我侄子的人工智能 B2B 酵母食谱应用程序领导三轮融资的最佳时机。谁能知道在短短几个月内，尽管我们的运营速度如此之快，世界会发生如此巨大的变化？供应链已经停滞。通货膨胀已经上升。突然间，你所有的薪水和牙科工作都像磨石一样挂在我的股票补偿方案的柔软脖子上。

I wish this weren’t the case. But we cannot avoid the externalities of today’s market, which is influenced by complicated global factors like the collapse of Chinese real estate, the war in Ukraine, and my desire for a marble kitchen island with a waterfall edge. As we all know, our competitors are relentless. Even as we speak, they’re streamlining, optimizing, and booking the best contractors in the Bay Area for the next eighteen months. If I could want to pay you, I would. I just simply can’t.  
我希望情况并非如此。但我们无法避免当今市场的外部性，它受到复杂的全球因素的影响，例如中国房地产的崩溃、乌克兰的战争，以及我对瀑布边大理石厨房岛的渴望。众所周知，我们的竞争对手是无情的。就在我们说话的时候，他们正在精简、优化和预订未来 18 个月湾区最好的承包商。如果我想付钱给你，我会的。我就是做不到。

This was not an easy decision to make. It’s weighed heavily on me for the past month, keeping me up at night and nearly causing me to cancel the exec team’s offsite, even though Bad Bunny’s appearance fee was only 50 percent refundable. Let’s not mince words, though; the accountability for this decision rests with me. The consequences, on the other hand, rest with you, but so does a pretty generous COBRA package.  
这不是一个容易做出的决定。在过去的一个月里，这对我造成了沉重的负担，让我彻夜难眠，差点导致我取消执行团队的场外活动，尽管 Bad Bunny 的出场费只能退还 50%。不过，我们不要拐弯抹角。这个决定的责任在我。另一方面，后果取决于您，但相当慷慨的 COBRA 套餐也是如此。

Ultimately, this decision was made out of an abundance of confidence in our mission and all the work you’ve put into it. The fact is, our fundamentals are sound. Our revenue is growing. Our cash reserves are high. We are not going anywhere (except for six thousand of you, but you’ll be going there with a free login for our talent hub). The fact is, if I wanted to pay you, I could. I could even give you raises. But once again, that is not the economic reality we face. And so we must make hard choices.  
最终，做出这个决定是出于对我们的使命以及您为之付出的所有工作的充分信心。事实上，我们的基本面是健全的。我们的收入在增长。我们的现金储备很高。我们不会去任何地方（你们中的六千人除外，但你们可以免费登录我们的人才中心）。事实上，如果我想付钱给你，我可以。我什至可以给你加薪。但再一次，这不是我们面临的经济现实。因此，我们必须做出艰难的选择。

For those of you we are losing, I’d like to say thank you for all the work you have given us, but there’s a good chance you’ve already been locked out of your computer before this email arrived.  
对于我们失去的那些人，我想说谢谢你们为我们所做的所有工作，但是很有可能在这封电子邮件到达之前你们已经被锁定在计算机之外了。

For those of you who are staying, I look forward to touching base at the town hall next week (forgive the early start time as I’m dialing in from Cinque Terre). In the meantime, please take a moment to reflect, refocus, and visualize the bright future ahead: one in which we double down on executional excellence, and I feel interested in paying you again.  
对于那些留下来的人，我期待着下周在市政厅接触基地（原谅我从五渔村拨入的提前开始时间）。与此同时，请花点时间反思、重新聚焦并想象未来的光明未来：我们会加倍努力实现卓越的执行力，我有兴趣再次向您付款。
