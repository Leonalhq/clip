## Christchurch shootings and White Island / Whakaari disaster  
基督城枪击事件和怀特岛/华卡里灾难

When it comes to her response to the Christchurch mosque shootings and the White Island / Whakaari volcano disaster, Ardern, whose last official engagement is on Tuesday, was seen by many as a “crisis leader” and much admired.  
在谈到她对克赖斯特彻奇清真寺枪击事件和怀特岛/华卡里火山灾难的回应时，阿德恩被许多人视为“危机领袖”，并备受钦佩。阿德恩的最后一次正式活动是在周二。

“She has done a remarkable job as the prime minister. She will be remembered as a crisis leader – erupting volcano, global pandemic, terrorist attack ... She did unite us as a ‘team of five million’. She brought us closer together and navigated the country through one crisis after another.” **Michal Chudzinski-Pawlowski, Auckland.**  
“作为总理，她做得非常出色。她将作为危机领袖而被人们铭记——火山爆发、全球流行病、恐怖袭击……她确实将我们团结成了一个“五百万人的团队”。她拉近了我们的距离，带领这个国家度过了一场又一场的危机。” Michal Chudzinski-Pawlowski，奥克兰。

“The defining moment has to be the way she handled the Christchurch terror attack … She’s definitely up there with the best leaders to have ever scaled the heights of prime ministership.” **Stephen Matich, Melbourne**  
“决定性的时刻必须是她处理克赖斯特彻奇恐怖袭击的方式......她绝对是有史以来最优秀的领导人，曾经登上过总理职位的高峰。”斯蒂芬·马蒂奇，墨尔本

## Coronavirus 新冠病毒

On Covid, many welcomed the tough approach which in the first years of the pandemic saw New Zealand impose harsh restrictions and seal its borders.  
在 Covid 上，许多人欢迎新西兰在大流行的头几年实施严厉限制并封锁边界的强硬做法。

“Very many thousands of people are alive and well today because of her and her government’s handling of the Covid pandemic.” **Eileen Bowell, Hamilton.**  
“由于她和她的政府对 Covid 大流行病的处理，今天有成千上万的人活着并且过得很好。”艾琳鲍威尔，汉密尔顿。

“She saved thousands of lives during Covid when others could have cost us.” **Michelle Bissenden, Dunedin.**  
“她在 Covid 期间挽救了数千人的生命，而其他人可能会让我们付出代价。”米歇尔·比森登，但尼丁。

However, others were unforgiving of the hardline stance. One reader, who wished to remain anonymous, wrote: “I missed giving my mother a hug before she died suddenly early 2021 due to Covid restrictions. The cost to so many New Zealanders of her draconian lockdown and management of \[quarantine system\] MIQ was unreasonable and breached our human rights.”  
然而，其他人对强硬立场并不宽容。一位不愿透露姓名的读者写道：“我错过了在 2021 年初由于 Covid 限制而突然去世之前给母亲一个拥抱的机会。她严厉的封锁和\[隔离系统\] MIQ 的管理给这么多新西兰人带来的代价是不合理的，侵犯了我们的人权。”

**Esther Pocock, from Sweden**, said Ardern “presided over a policy of rare cruelty and created divisions between Kiwis to maintain her hold”.  
来自瑞典的埃斯特·波科克 (Esther Pocock) 说，阿德恩“主持了一项罕见的残忍政策，并在新西兰人之间制造分歧以维持她的地位”。

“She illegally locked approximately one million Kiwis out of their home country during one of the worst pandemics in living memory, leaving us to fend for ourselves and forcibly separating us from our families, and locked the rest of the country in.”  
“在人们记忆中最严重的流行病之一期间，她非法将大约 100 万新西兰人拒之门外，让我们自生自灭，并强行将我们与家人分开，并将全国其他地区封锁在国内。”

## **Domestic policies 国内政策**

Some readers were critical of Ardern’s broader domestic policy record.  
一些读者批评阿德恩更广泛的国内政策记录。

“The promise of more affordable housing has not been achieved; poverty among the poorest has not improved. There has been little progress on any reforms and so her legacy will be not remembered well.” **Nick Gibson, New Zealand**.  
“提供更多经济适用房的承诺尚未实现；最贫穷者的贫困状况没有改善。任何改革都没有取得什么进展，因此她的遗产不会被人们很好地记住。”尼克·吉布森，新西兰。

“She saved all her niceness for the world stage… She made a lot of promises and set a lot of goals and failed to fulfil any.” **Mike ONeill, New Zealand**.  
“她把所有的美好都留给了世界舞台……她许下了很多承诺，设定了很多目标，但都没有实现。”迈克·奥尼尔，新西兰。

**Mike Richards, Hamilton, New Zealand,** said Ardern “divided the nation”.  
来自新西兰汉密尔顿的迈克·理查兹 (Mike Richards) 说阿德恩“分裂了国家”。

“She promised to prioritise child poverty, yet her policies made people poorer and created a major cost of living crisis … Her Covid policies kept children out of school for almost a year and now we have a ram-raiding crime crisis. She has led the most incompetent government we have ever had, capable of spending millions on committees and reports, but totally incapable of delivering anything.”  
“她承诺优先考虑儿童贫困，但她的政策让人们变得更穷，并造成了重大的生活成本危机……她的 Covid 政策让孩子们失学了将近一年，现在我们面临着一场袭击公羊的犯罪危机。她领导的政府是我们有史以来最无能的政府，有能力在委员会和报告上花费数百万美元，但完全无能为力。”

Yet most admired Ardern’s character and leadership style, with supporters regarding her as an inspirational leader.

**Clint Baker, South Auckland**, reflected on the “Jacinda effect”.  
南奥克兰的 Clint Baker 反思了“Jacinda 效应”。

“I will remember Jacinda’s time in office as a time when New Zealanders could be proud of the reputation she gained for us around the world as a country. The ‘Jacinda effect’. I cannot recall any other leader, either here in NZ or in Australia having so many challenges during their time in office … Ardern’s responses were always well articulated with warmth and empathy.”  
“我会记得 Jacinda 任职期间，新西兰人可以为她在世界各地为我们国家赢得的声誉感到自豪。 “杰辛达效应”。我不记得有任何其他领导人，无论是在新西兰还是在澳大利亚，在任期间都遇到过如此多的挑战……阿德恩的回应总是充满热情和同理心。”

“She was an inspirational leader during a very difficult time; she was the right leader for the time; her compassion and understanding were so refreshing and an antidote to the unpleasant, divisive politics of some in this country and other parts of the world.” **David McKenzie, New Zealand.**  
“在非常困难的时期，她是一位鼓舞人心的领导者；她是当时合适的领导者；她的同情心和理解力令人耳目一新，是解决这个国家和世界其他地方一些令人不快、分裂的政治的一剂良药。”大卫·麦肯齐，新西兰。

**Dominic Hayes, Belgium** said the 42-year-old “inspired a new generation of leaders”.  
比利时的多米尼克·海耶斯 (Dominic Hayes) 表示，这位 42 岁的年轻人“启发了新一代领导人”。

“A breath of fresh air in politics, genuine compassion, empathy and humanity, but tough when she needed to be.”  
“政治上的新鲜空气，真诚的同情心，同情心和人性，但在需要时会变得强硬。”
