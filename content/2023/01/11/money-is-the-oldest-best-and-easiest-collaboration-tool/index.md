> It is our DUTY to ask for money so that commercial customers understand the value and feel comfortable that we are driven by motives that they understand. They want someone to blame when it is not working. And we in turn are then honor bound to use that money to safeguard the investment that our customers are making. Putting all the money in your pocket without reinvesting (most) of it is dishonest, but allowing a technology to wither by not ensuring that it has a solid foundation is every bit as irresponsible (IMHO !!!).
> 
> 我们的职责是向商业客户要钱，让他们理解我们的价值，让他们感到放心，因为我们被他们理解的动机所驱使。他们希望有人在不起作用时受到责备。反过来，我们也有责任用这笔钱来保护我们客户正在进行的投资。把所有的钱放在口袋里而不再投资（大部分）是不诚实的，但是让一项技术因为没有确保它有坚实的基础而枯萎是完全不负责任的（恕我直言！！！）。

> It should be very inexpensive to get started - but people HAVE to contribute when they get real value from using the tool.

> 开始使用应该非常便宜——但是当人们从使用这个工具中获得真正的价值时，他们必须做出贡献。

We are spoiled by too many free heritage in the software that we ignore this common sense.  
我们被软件中太多的免费遗产宠坏了，以至于我们忽略了这个常识。  

When you start charging, it will be easier for you to start a longer-term collaboration with others. When you find that the charges are insufficient, you will also get feedback to go in a truly valuable direction.

当你开始收费时，你会更容易与他人开始更长期的合作，当你发现收费不足时，你也会得到反馈，朝着真正有价值的方向前进。

In my understanding, smart people and geeks often have a greater sense of morality and are unwilling to charge fees. But this sense of morality will become a twisted form to hinder people's normal development.

在我的理解中，聪明人和极客往往有更大的道德感，不愿意收费；但这种道德感会变成扭曲的形式，阻碍人们的正常发展。

This is very sad. The best people are trapped in the trap of providing services free of charge, while another group of people are getting very precious cash flow with very disadvantaged products and services. As a result, social resources are not allocated to those in need.

这是非常可悲的，最优秀的人被困在免费提供服务的陷阱里，而另一部分人却用非常弱势的产品和服务获得非常宝贵的现金流，导致社会资源没有分配给有需要的人。

If you want to work better with this society and charge you for your work, no matter how much it is, even a little cost, this mechanism will make it easier for you to collaborate with others.

如果你想和这个社会更好地合作，向你的工作收费，不管是多少，哪怕是一点成本，这种机制都会让你更容易与他人协作。

Money is a universal collaborative interface. If you refuse to use this, you are doing things in a more expensive way, and it is not long-term.

金钱是一个通用的协作接口，如果你拒绝使用这个，你是在以一种更昂贵的方式做事，而且这不是长远的。

On the other point, I remember saying in sivers that many times, providing free products also deprives people of the right to pay for you. You should allow people who really like you to express their appreciation for you.

关于另一点，我记得我在西弗斯说过，很多时候，提供免费产品也剥夺了人们为你付费的权利。你应该允许真正喜欢你的人表达对你的欣赏。

When you are struggling, you can go back to this starting point and try the oldest and most effective way of human collaboration.

当你在挣扎的时候，你可以回到这个起点，尝试最古老、最有效的人类协作方式。
