### Defiant. 挑衅。

By now you have seen a historic image of a German man at a Nazi party rally who very obviously refused a salute to Adolf Hitler. Not honoring the leader of the nation was the ultimate act of treason in the eyes of Germany. **His name was August Landmesser and he had a very noble reason to defy Hitler.**

到目前为止，你已经在纳粹集会上看到了一个德国人的历史性形象，他显然拒绝向阿道夫·希特勒敬礼。在德国人看来，不尊重国家领导人是最高的叛国行为。他的名字叫奥古斯特·兰德梅瑟，他有一个非常崇高的理由反抗希特勒。

August Landmesser was a member of the Nazi Party and a devout follower of Adolf Hitler like the majority of Germany. He lived a normal life and had a humble job working in the Blohm+Voss shipyard in Hamburg. A normal life would change well he fell in love with a woman named Irma Eckler. **This seems like a fairly normal thing for a Landmesser and his humble life but the issue was Irma Eckler was Jewish.**

奥古斯特·兰德梅塞尔是纳粹党的成员，也是阿道夫·希特勒的虔诚追随者，就像大多数德国人一样。他过着正常的生活，在汉堡的布隆+沃斯造船厂工作。正常的生活会改变，他爱上了一个叫伊尔玛·埃克勒的女人。这对兰德梅塞尔和他卑微的生活来说似乎是一件相当正常的事情，但问题是伊尔玛·埃克勒是犹太人。

August Landmesser’s decision was easy, he chose love over the Nazi Party. However, the newly enacted Nuremberg Laws prevented his union with Irma Eckler and they eventually had a child. Then came the moment that solidified his place in history, the launch of the Horst Wessel. **There August Landmesser defiantly refused to salute Adolf Hitler as he addressed the public and the Nazi Party took action.**

奥古斯特·兰德梅塞尔的决定很容易，他选择了爱情而不是纳粹党。然而，新颁布的纽伦堡法律阻止了他与伊尔玛·埃克勒的结合，他们最终有了一个孩子。然后是巩固他在历史上地位的时刻，霍斯特·韦塞尔号的发射。在那里，奥古斯特·兰德梅塞尔在向公众发表讲话时挑衅地拒绝向阿道夫·希特勒致敬，纳粹党采取了行动。

His engagement to a Jewish woman caused Landmesser to be expelled from the Nazi Party. **Fathering a child with Irma Eckler branded him a traitor as many claimed he was “Dishonoring the race.”** For his actions, he was sent to a concentration camp for a period of two years and after that, he was forced into a military unit made up entirely of prisoners. His unit was poorly armed and essentially used as a human shield, he was killed in a conflict with the Soviets in 1944.

他与一名犹太妇女的婚约导致兰德梅塞尔被驱逐出纳粹党。与伊尔玛·埃克勒生了一个孩子，这让他被称为叛徒，因为许多人声称他“玷污了种族”因为他的行为，他被送到集中营呆了两年，之后，他被迫加入了一个完全由囚犯组成的军事单位。他的部队装备不良，基本上被用作人盾，他在1944年与苏联的冲突中被杀。

Landmesser made a bold decision to defy a dictator and follow his heart and his bold statement has been immortalized forever. **This video goes into deeper detail about the tragic life of August Landmesser.**

兰德梅瑟做出了一个大胆的决定，反抗独裁者，跟随他的心，他大胆的声明永远不朽。这段视频深入介绍了奥古斯特·兰德梅瑟悲惨生活的细节。
