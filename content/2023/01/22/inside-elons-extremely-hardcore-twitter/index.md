这篇文章是纽约杂志和 The Verge 的合作。这是由编写 Platformer 的 Zoe Schiffer 和 Casey Newton 以及编写 Command Line 的 Alex Heath 报告的。

In April 2022, Elon Musk acquired a 9.2 percent stake in Twitter, making him the company’s largest shareholder, and was offered a seat on the board. Luke Simon, a senior engineering director at Twitter, was ecstatic. “Elon Musk is a brilliant engineer and scientist, and he has a track record of having a Midas touch, when it comes to growing the companies he’s helped lead,” he wrote in Slack.  
2022 年 4 月，埃隆·马斯克收购了 Twitter 9.2% 的股份，成为该公司最大的股东，并获得了董事会席位。 Twitter 的高级工程总监 Luke Simon 欣喜若狂。 “埃隆马斯克是一位杰出的工程师和科学家，在帮助领导的公司发展壮大方面，他有着点石成金的记录，”他在 Slack 中写道。

Twitter had been defined by the catatonic leadership of Jack Dorsey, a co-founder who simultaneously served as CEO of the payments business Block (formerly Square). Dorsey, who was known for going on long meditation retreats, fasting 22 hours a day, and walking five miles to the office, acted as an absentee landlord, leaving Twitter’s strategy and daily operations to a handful of trusted deputies. When he spoke about Twitter, it was often as if someone else were running the company. To Simon and those like him, it was hard to see Twitter as anything other than wasted potential.   
Twitter 是由杰克·多尔西 (Jack Dorsey) 的紧张型领导定义的，他是联合创始人，同时担任支付业务 Block（前身为 Square）的首席执行官。多尔西以进行长时间的冥想静修、每天禁食 22 小时以及步行 5 英里到办公室而闻名，他充当了缺席的房东，将 Twitter 的战略和日常运营留给了少数值得信赖的代表。当他谈到 Twitter 时，就好像其他人在经营公司一样。对于西蒙和像他一样的人来说，除了浪费潜力之外，很难将 Twitter 视为任何东西。

In its early days, when Twitter was at its most Twittery, circa 2012, executives called the company “the free-speech wing of the free-speech party.” That was the era when the platform was credited for amplifying the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Arab Spring, when it seemed like giving everyone a microphone might actually bring down dictatorships and right the wrongs of neoliberal capitalism. That moment, which coincided with the rise of Facebook and YouTube, inspired utopian visions of how social networks could promote democracy and human rights around the world.  
在早期，大约在 2012 年，当 Twitter 最推特时，高管们称该公司为“言论自由党的言论自由之翼”。在那个时代，该平台因扩大占领华尔街运动和阿拉伯之春而受到赞誉，当时似乎给每个人一个麦克风实际上可能会推翻独裁统治并纠正新自由主义资本主义的错误。那一刻恰逢 Facebook 和 YouTube 的兴起，激发了社交网络如何促进世界各地的民主和人权的乌托邦愿景。

Twitter rode this momentum to become one of the most important companies in tech: an all-consuming obsession for those working or merely interested in politics, sports, and journalism around the world. Frequently, the platform set the news agenda and transformed nobodies into Main Characters. What it lacked in profits it more than made up for in influence.  
Twitter 借助这一势头成为科技领域最重要的公司之一：这是全世界那些对政治、体育和新闻工作或仅对政治、体育和新闻感兴趣的人的一种痴迷。通常，该平台设置新闻议程并将无名小卒转变为主角。它在利润上的不足在影响力上得到了弥补。

Rumors were swirling that Musk planned to cut 75 percent of the company. People were audibly sobbing in the bathrooms.  
谣言四起，马斯克计划削减公司 75% 的股份。人们在浴室里大声抽泣。

No one understood how to weaponize that influence better than Donald Trump, who in 2016 propelled himself into the White House in part by harnessing hate and vitriol via his @realDonaldTrump feed. A new consensus that the site was a sewer made it worth a lot less money. Disney CEO Bob Iger pulled out of a bid to acquire Twitter, saying the “nastiness” on the platform was extraordinary.  
没有人比唐纳德特朗普更了解如何将这种影响力武器化，唐纳德特朗普在 2016 年通过他的@realDonaldTrump 饲料利用仇恨和尖酸刻薄将自己推入白宫。一个新的共识是该站点是一个下水道，这使得它的价值大大降低。迪士尼首席执行官鲍勃·艾格退出了对 Twitter 的收购，称该平台上的“肮脏”非比寻常。

After the election and the blown deal, Twitter overhauled its content-moderation policies, staffed up its trust and safety team, and committed itself to fostering “healthy conversations.” Never again would it let itself be used by a tyrant to sow discord and increase polarization. Two days after the January 6 insurrection, the platform banned Trump; the company had seen the toll of unfettered speech and decided it wasn’t worth it.  
在选举和失败的交易之后，Twitter 彻底改革了其内容审核政策，为其信任和安全团队配备了人员，并致力于促进“健康的对话”。它再也不会让自己被暴君利用来挑拨离间和加剧两极分化。 1 月 6 日暴动两天后，该平台禁止了特朗普；该公司已经看到了不受限制的言论所带来的代价，并认为这是不值得的。

This was the Twitter that irked Elon Musk so much that he became convinced he had to buy it. In his view, by 2022 the company had been corrupted — beholden to the whims of governments and the liberal media elite. It shadow-banned conservatives, suppressed legitimate discourse about covid, and selectively kicked elected officials off the platform. Who better to restore Twitter to its former glory than its wealthiest poster?   
正是这个推特让埃隆·马斯克非常恼火，以至于他确信自己必须购买它。在他看来，到 2022 年，该公司已经腐败——受制于政府和自由媒体精英的一时兴起。它影子禁止保守派，压制关于 covid 的合法话语，并有选择地将民选官员踢出平台。还有谁能比最富有的发帖人更能让 Twitter 重现昔日的辉煌呢？

Like Trump, Musk knew how to use Twitter to make himself the center of the conversation. His incessant, irreverent tweeting violated every norm of corporate America, endearing his fans, pissing off his haters, and making him the second-most-followed active account on the site. “At least 50% of my tweets were made on a porcelain throne,” he tweeted one evening in late 2021. “It gives me solace.”  
和特朗普一样，马斯克知道如何使用推特让自己成为谈话的中心。他不停地、不敬地发推文违反了美国企业界的每一项规范，赢得了粉丝的喜爱，激怒了仇恨他的人，并使他成为该网站上第二大关注活跃账户。 “我至少有 50% 的推文是在瓷王座上发的，”他在 2021 年底的一个晚上发推文说。“这给了我安慰。”

Musk offered to buy the company for the absurdly inflated price of $44 billion. The move thrilled employees like Simon who chafed at Twitter’s laid-back atmosphere and reputation for shipping new features at a glacial pace. Simon, who owned a portrait of himself dressed as a 19th-century French general, told his team, which managed advertising services, that he wanted to build an “impact-focused, egalitarian and empirical culture, where any team member, with a strong data-driven justification, gets the metaphorical center stage.”  
马斯克提出以 440 亿美元的高得离谱的价格收购该公司。这一举措让像西蒙这样的员工兴奋不已，他们对 Twitter 悠闲的氛围和以冰川速度发布新功能的声誉感到恼火。西蒙拥有一幅打扮成 19 世纪法国将军的肖像，他告诉管理广告服务的团队，他想建立一种“以影响为中心、平等主义和经验主义的文化，任何团队成员都具有强烈的数据驱动的理由，成为隐喻的中心舞台。”

Other employees noted the darker motifs of Musk’s career — the disregard he brought to labor relations, the many lawsuits alleging sexual harassment and racial discrimination at his companies — and found his interest in Twitter ominous. On Slack, a product manager responded to Simon’s enthusiasm for Musk with skepticism: “I take your point, but as a childhood Greek mythology nerd, I feel it is important to point out that story behind the idea of the Midas touch is not a positive one. It’s a cautionary tale about what is lost when you only focus on wealth.”  
其他员工注意到马斯克职业生涯中更黑暗的主题——他对劳资关系的漠视，许多指控其公司发生性骚扰和种族歧视的诉讼——并发现他对 Twitter 的兴趣是不祥之兆。在 Slack 上，一位产品经理以怀疑的态度回应了西蒙对马斯克的热情：“我同意你的观点，但作为一个童年时期的希腊神话书呆子，我觉得有必要指出点石成金想法背后的故事并不是积极的一。这是一个关于当你只关注财富时会失去什么的警示故事。”

The comment would prove to be prophetic. According to more than two dozen current and former Twitter staffers, since buying the company in October 2022, Musk has shown a remarkable lack of interest in the people and processes that make his new toy tick. He has purged thousands of employees, implemented ill-advised policies, and angered even some of his most loyal supporters. Those who remain at the company mostly fall into two camps: people trapped by the need for health care and visas or cold-eyed mercenaries hoping to ascend through a power vacuum.  
该评论将被证明是预言性的。据 20 多位 Twitter 现任和前任员工称，自 2022 年 10 月收购该公司以来，马斯克表现出对让他的新玩具运转起来的人员和流程明显缺乏兴趣。他清洗了数千名员工，实施了不明智的政策，甚至激怒了他的一些最忠实的支持者。留在公司的人大多分为两个阵营：被医疗保健和签证需求困住的人，或者希望通过权力真空提升的冷眼雇佣兵。

Today, Musk has become notorious for the speech he suppresses, rather than the speech he allows, from suspending journalists for tweeting links to his jet tracker to briefly restricting users from linking to their accounts on Instagram and Mastodon.  
如今，马斯克因压制而不是允许的言论而臭名昭著，从暂停记者在推特上发布指向他的喷气式飞机追踪器的链接，到短暂限制用户链接到他们在 Instagram 和 Mastodon 上的帐户。

In three months, Musk has also largely destroyed the equity value of Twitter and much of his personal wealth. He has indicated that the company could declare bankruptcy, and the distraction of running it has caused Tesla stock to crater, costing him $200 billion.  
在三个月的时间里，马斯克也在很大程度上摧毁了 Twitter 的股权价值和他的大部分个人财富。他曾表示，该公司可能会宣布破产，而经营这家公司的分心导致特斯拉股价暴跌，使他损失了 2000 亿美元。

If “free speech” was his mandate for Twitter the platform, it has been the opposite for Twitter the workplace. Dissenting opinion or criticism has led to swift dismissals. Musk replaced Twitter’s old culture with one of his own, but it’s unclear, with so few workers and plummeting revenues, if this new version will survive. As one employee said in December, “Place is done for.”  
如果“言论自由”是他对 Twitter 这个平台的使命，那么对 Twitter 这个工作场所来说，情况恰恰相反。不同意见或批评导致迅速解雇。马斯克用他自己的一种文化取代了 Twitter 的旧文化，但目前还不清楚，在员工人数如此之少和收入直线下降的情况下，这个新版本是否能存活下来。正如一名员工在 12 月所说，“地方已经完蛋了。”

On October 26, an engineer and mother of two — let’s call her Alicia — sat in a glass conference room in San Francisco trying to explain the details of Twitter’s tech stack to Elon Musk. He was supposed to officially buy the company in two days, and Alicia and a small group of trusted colleagues were tasked with outlining how its core infrastructure worked. But Musk, who was sitting two seats away from Alicia with his elbows propped on the table, looked sleepy. When he did talk, it was to ask questions about cost. How much does Twitter spend on data centers? Why was everything so expensive?  
10 月 26 日，一位工程师和两个孩子的母亲——我们称她为 Alicia——坐在旧金山的一间玻璃会议室里，试图向 Elon Musk 解释 Twitter 技术栈的细节。他本应在两天内正式收购这家公司，艾丽西亚和一小群值得信赖的同事的任务是概述其核心基础设施的运作方式。但马斯克坐在离艾丽西亚两个座位远的地方，手肘支在桌子上，看起来很困倦。当他说话时，就是问有关成本的问题。 Twitter 在数据中心上花了多少钱？为什么一切都这么贵？

Alicia was already tired of Musk’s antics. For months, he had gone back and forth about buying the company where she had worked for more than a decade. He’d tried to back out of the deal, but Twitter sued, and the chief judge of Delaware’s Chancery Court said a trial would move forward if the acquisition wasn’t complete by October 28. Facing what many legal observers called an easy case for Twitter, Musk caved. So here they were, trying to show Musk what he was about to buy, and all he wanted to talk about was money.   
艾丽西亚已经厌倦了马斯克的滑稽动作。几个月来，他一直在考虑收购她工作了十多年的公司。他曾试图退出交易，但 Twitter 提起诉讼，特拉华州衡平法院的首席法官表示，如果收购未能在 10 月 28 日之前完成，审判将继续进行。面对许多法律观察家所说的简单案件推特，马斯克屈服了。所以他们就在这里，试图向马斯克展示他要买什么，而他只想谈钱。

_Fine,_ she thought. _If Musk wants to know about money, I’ll tell him._ She launched into a technical explanation of the company’s data-center efficiency, curious to see if he would follow along. Instead, he interrupted. “I was writing C programs in the ’90s,” he said dismissively. “I understand how computers work.”  
很好，她想。如果马斯克想了解金钱，我会告诉他。她开始对公司的数据中心效率进行技术解释，好奇地想看看他是否会跟进。相反，他打断了。 “我在 90 年代写 C 程序，”他轻蔑地说。 “我了解计算机的工作原理。”

Alicia knew Twitter had problems; when prospective employees asked her why she’d stayed there so long, she would tell them, honestly, that the company was incredibly inefficient. It took a long time to get buy-in on projects, and communication across teams was generally poor. But it operated with a “benevolent anarchy” through which anyone could influence the direction of the product. “You didn’t need someone in a position of power to explicitly grant you permission,” Alicia says. “It was very much a bottom-up organization.”  
艾丽西亚知道 Twitter 有问题；当未来的员工问她为什么在那里待了这么久时，她会诚实地告诉他们，公司效率低得令人难以置信。获得项目认可需要很长时间，而且团队之间的沟通通常很差。但它以一种“仁慈的无政府状态”运作，任何人都可以通过这种状态影响产品的方向。 “你不需要有权势的人明确授予你许可，”艾丽西亚说。 “这是一个自下而上的组织。”

Unlike some of her colleagues, Alicia wasn’t reflexively anti-Musk. She respected what he had done at his companies and felt hopeful that, as someone who thought of himself as an engineer, he would support her highly technical work. But Musk had a different interest that day. Twitter, he said, should immediately get into video.  
与她的一些同事不同，艾丽西亚并不是本能地反对马斯克。她尊重他在他的公司所做的一切，并希望作为一个自认为是工程师的人，他会支持她的高技术工作。但马斯克那天有不同的兴趣。他说，推特应该立即进入视频领域。

“Please be ready to show your recent code (within last 30-60 preferably) on your computer. If you have already printed, please shred in the bins on SF-Tenth. Thank you!”  
“请准备好在您的计算机上显示您最近的代码（最好在最近 30-60 内）。如果您已经打印过，请将其放入 SF-Tenth 的垃圾箱中。谢谢！”

“We really should be able to do longform video and attract the best content creators by giving them a better cut than YouTube,” he said, according to Alicia’s recollection. The infrastructure engineers in the room agreed that adding support for longform video was technically possible, but their job was building stuff — not strategy or marketing. It seemed as though Musk didn’t understand the basic organizational structure of a social-media company; it was as if a rich guy had bought a restaurant and started telling the cooks he wanted to add a new dining room. Might he want to speak with the _media product_ team instead?   
根据艾丽西亚的回忆，他说：“我们真的应该能够制作长视频，并通过为他们提供比 YouTube 更好的剪辑来吸引最好的内容创作者。”房间里的基础设施工程师一致认为，添加对长视频的支持在技术上是可行的，但他们的工作是构建东西——而不是战略或营销。似乎马斯克不了解社交媒体公司的基本组织结构；就好像一个有钱人买了一家餐馆，然后开始告诉厨师他想增加一个新的餐厅。他可能想与媒体产品团队交谈吗？

Just then, David Sacks, a venture capitalist and friend of Musk’s who had advised him on the acquisition, walked into the room. A fellow native of South Africa, Sacks had worked with Musk at PayPal and later led the enterprise social-networking company Yammer to a $1.2 billion sale to Microsoft.  
就在这时，风险投资家、马斯克的朋友大卫·萨克斯 (David Sacks) 走进了房间，他曾为马斯克的收购提供过建议。 Sacks 是南非人，曾在 PayPal 与马斯克共事，后来带领企业社交网络公司 Yammer 以 12 亿美元的价格出售给了微软。

“David, this meeting is too technical for you,” Musk said, waving his hand to dismiss Sacks. Wordlessly, Sacks turned and walked out, leaving the engineers — who had gotten little engagement from Musk on anything technical — slack-jawed. His imperiousness in the middle of a session he appeared to be botching was something to behold. (Musk did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)  
“大卫，这次会议对你来说太技术性了，”马斯克说着挥手打发萨克斯。萨克斯一言不发地转身走了出去，留下工程师们——他们在任何技术问题上都没有得到马斯克的参与——目瞪口呆。他在会议进行到一半时表现出的专横，他似乎搞砸了，这是值得注意的。 （马斯克没有回应多项置评请求。）

The next day, Alicia and her colleagues gathered in the cafeteria of Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters for a long-planned Halloween party. The room was decorated with miniature pumpkins and fake spiderwebs. Employees tried to get in the holiday spirit, but rumors were swirling that Musk planned to cut 75 percent of the company. People were audibly sobbing in the bathrooms. One company leader recalled the surreal moment of crying about the end of Twitter as they knew it, only to look up and see a person in a Jack Sparrow costume amble by. Outside on the balcony, one entertainer blew bubbles for staffers’ children. Another figure, dressed as a scarecrow, seemed to have a handler following him. There were whispers: Could it be Musk himself in costume? It turned out to be a hired performer.  
第二天，艾丽西亚和她的同事们聚集在 Twitter 旧金山总部的自助餐厅，参加了一场筹备已久的万圣节派对。房间里装饰着微型南瓜和假蜘蛛网。员工们试图营造节日氛围，但谣言四起，称马斯克计划削减公司 75% 的股份。人们在浴室里大声抽泣。一位公司领导回忆起他们为 Twitter 的终结而哭泣的超现实时刻，结果抬头看到一个穿着杰克斯派洛服装的人缓缓走过。在外面的阳台上，一位艺人正在为员工的孩子们吹泡泡。另一个打扮成稻草人的身影，似乎有一个驯兽师跟着他。有人窃窃私语：难道是马斯克本人穿着戏服？原来是一个受雇的表演者。

As Alicia walked out of the office that evening, she passed Twitter’s head of product, Jay Sullivan, who was standing alone, looking solemn. “It’s done,” he said. The deal had closed during the party.   
那天晚上，当艾丽西亚走出办公室时，她经过了 Twitter 的产品负责人杰·沙利文 (Jay Sullivan)，后者独自站着，神情严肃。 “完成了，”他说。交易在聚会期间完成。

It took only a few hours before news broke that Twitter’s executive team had walked the plank. Parag Agrawal, the CEO, was out, along with Vijaya Gadde, the head of policy, and Ned Segal, the chief finance officer. They had known what was coming and stayed away from the office. Sean Edgett, the general counsel, was also fired; he had been present for the handover and was unceremoniously escorted out of the building during the Halloween party.   
仅仅几个小时后，Twitter 的执行团队就已经走到了尽头的消息传出。首席执行官 Parag Agrawal 与政策负责人 Vijaya Gadde 和首席财务官 Ned Segal 一起出局。他们知道接下来会发生什么，因此远离了办公室。总法律顾问肖恩·埃吉特 (Sean Edgett) 也被解雇了；他出席了交接仪式，并在万圣节派对期间被毫不客气地护送出了大楼。

The days surrounding the acquisition passed in a blur of ominous, unlikely scenes. Musk posing as the world’s richest prop comic, announcing his takeover by lugging a kitchen sink into the office: [“Entering Twitter HQ—let that sink in!”](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1585341984679469056?lang=en) (181.2K retweets, 43.6K quote tweets, 1.3M likes.) A fleet of Teslas in the parking lot. Musk’s intimidating security detail standing outside his glass conference room as if guarding the leader of a developing nation. Musk’s 2-year-old son, X Æ A-Xii, toddling around the second floor, occasionally crying.   
围绕收购的日子在一片不祥的、不太可能的场景中过去了。马斯克冒充世界上最富有的道具喜剧演员，通过拖着厨房水槽进入办公室宣布他的接管：“进入 Twitter 总部——让它沉入其中！” （181.2K 转推，43.6K 引用推文，130 万个赞。）停车场里的特斯拉车队。马斯克令人生畏的安保人员站在他的玻璃会议室外面，仿佛在保护一个发展中国家的领导人。马斯克 2 岁的儿子 X Æ A-Xii 在二楼蹒跚学步，偶尔哭泣。

Employees braced for layoffs, but no word came from Musk. People hunted for information on their unofficial Slacks, Discords, and Signal chats while glued to Musk’s Twitter feed for news like everyone else. “Hey all don’t forget to complete your q3 goals!” one employee wrote darkly on Slack. “Writes, ‘stay employed,’ ” responded a colleague.   
员工准备裁员，但马斯克没有任何消息。人们在他们的非官方 Slacks、Discord 和 Signal 聊天中寻找信息，同时像其他人一样关注马斯克的 Twitter 提要以获取新闻。 “嘿，别忘了完成你们的 q3 目标！”一名员工在 Slack 上写下了黑暗。 “写道，‘保持就业’，”一位同事回答道。

Even Twitter executives were clueless. Chief marketing officer Leslie Berland sent an email encouraging employees to say hi to Musk if they saw him in the office and promised an all-hands meeting would happen that Friday. An invitation for a companywide assembly appeared on people’s calendars, then disappeared. When employees followed up on Slack, the head of internal communications cryptically said she would “send out a communication when there are further details.”   
就连 Twitter 的高管也一头雾水。首席营销官莱斯利·伯兰 (Leslie Berland) 发送了一封电子邮件，鼓励员工在办公室看到马斯克时向他打招呼，并承诺将于周五召开全体会议。全公司集会的邀请出现在人们的日历上，然后消失了。当员工跟进 Slack 时，内部沟通负责人含糊其辞地表示，她会“在有更多细节时发出通知”。

Musk brought in a cadre of close advisers, including Sacks and his fellow venture capitalist and podcast co-host Jason Calacanis; Musk’s celebrity lawyer, Alex Spiro; Steve Davis, the head of his tunneling start-up, the Boring Company; and Sriram Krishnan, who had previously been a consumer-product director at Twitter. To employees, this crew would be known by only one name: the Goons.  
马斯克带来了一批亲密的顾问，包括萨克斯和他的风险投资家同事兼播客联合主持人贾森卡拉卡尼斯；马斯克的名人律师亚历克斯斯皮罗； Steve Davis，他的隧道开办公司 Boring Company 的负责人；和 Sriram Krishnan，他曾是 Twitter 的消费产品总监。对于员工来说，这支队伍只有一个名字：Goons。

On Musk’s first full day in charge, October 28, the executive assistants sent Twitter engineers a Slack message at the behest of the Goons: The boss wanted to see their code. Employees were instructed to “print out 50 pages of code you’ve done in the last 30 days” and get ready to show it to Musk in person. Panicked engineers started hunting around the office for printers. Many of the devices weren’t functional, having sat unused for two years during the pandemic. Eventually, a group of executive assistants offered to print some engineers’ code for them if they would send the file as a PDF.  
10 月 28 日，在马斯克上任的第一天，执行助理应 Goons 的要求向 Twitter 工程师发送了一条 Slack 消息：老板想看他们的代码。员工被指示“打印出你在过去 30 天内完成的 50 页代码”，并准备好亲自展示给马斯克。惊慌失措的工程师开始在办公室四处寻找打印机。许多设备都无法使用，在大流行期间已经闲置了两年。最终，一组行政助理提出可以为他们打印一些工程师的代码，前提是他们愿意将文件以 PDF 格式发送。

Within a couple of hours, the Goons’ assistants sent out a new missive to the team: “update: Stop printing,” it read. “Please be ready to show your recent code (within last 30-60 preferably) on your computer. If you have already printed, please shred in the bins on SF-Tenth. Thank you!”  
在几个小时内，Goons 的助手向团队发送了一封新邮件：“更新：停止打印，”上面写道。 “请准备好在您的计算机上显示您最近的代码（最好在最近 30-60 内）。如果您已经打印过，请将其放入 SF-Tenth 的垃圾箱中。谢谢！”

Alicia was scheduled to meet with Musk around 11 a.m. She felt bad about the anxiety coursing through the office, even if she was sanguine about the process. As a back-end engineer, she was used to being woken up in the middle of the night because something on the platform was breaking — a crisis that could impact millions of Twitter users. It took more than a code review to faze her.   
艾丽西亚计划在上午 11 点左右与马斯克会面。她对办公室里弥漫的焦虑情绪感到难过，尽管她对这个过程很乐观。作为一名后端工程师，她已经习惯了在半夜被叫醒，因为平台上的东西出了问题——一场可能影响数百万 Twitter 用户的危机。让她烦恼的不仅仅是代码审查。

She had printed out a few lines of Python rather than her actual code repository. (“Python is more at Musk’s level,” she says.) The mandate had felt like a stunt, and she’d doubted he would really engage: “I’m not gonna explain the project I’ve spent ten years working on in a fraction of an hour competing with ten other people — I’m just not.”   
她打印了几行 Python，而不是实际的代码库。 （“Python 更接近于马斯克的水平，”她说。）这项授权感觉就像一个噱头，她怀疑他是否真的会参与：“我不会解释我花了十年时间从事的项目与其他十个人竞争不到一个小时——我只是没有。”

She never had to. The meeting was pushed back, then canceled. “We didn’t actually get to show our code to Elon,” she says, laughing. “Which is a shame. I was very much looking forward to it.”  
她从来不需要。会议被推迟，然后取消。 “我们实际上并没有向 Elon 展示我们的代码，”她笑着说。 “真可惜。我非常期待。”

The botched code review did little to deter the Goons, who still needed to figure out which of Twitter’s 7,500 employees were needed to keep the site running — and who could be jettisoned. At ten that same night, they told managers they should “stack rank” their teams, a common but cold method of evaluation that forces managers to designate their lowest performers.  
拙劣的代码审查并没有阻止 Goons，他们仍然需要弄清楚 Twitter 的 7,500 名员工中需要哪些人来维持网站的运行——以及哪些人可以被抛弃。当天晚上 10 点，他们告诉经理们他们应该对他们的团队进行“堆叠排名”，这是一种常见但冷酷的评估方法，迫使经理们指定表现最差的人。

Amir Shevat, who managed Twitter’s developer platform and had led large teams at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, was perplexed. Every company did stack ranking differently. Should they sort workers by seniority? Impact? Revenue generated? No one had an answer. “They said, ‘We don’t know. Elon wants a stack rank,’ ” Shevat says.   
管理 Twitter 开发者平台并曾在亚马逊、谷歌和微软领导大型团队的阿米尔·谢瓦特 (Amir Shevat) 感到困惑。每家公司的堆栈排名都不同。他们应该按资历对工人进行排序吗？影响？产生的收入？没有人有答案。 “他们说，‘我们不知道。 Elon 想要一个堆栈排名，' ”Shevatsays。

The project succeeded in generating large lists of names, but because different managers had ranked employees according to their own methods, the results were incoherent. “If I were to get that list, I would probably throw it in the garbage because it’s completely useless,” Shevat says.  
该项目成功生成了大量名单，但由于不同的经理根据自己的方法对员工进行排名，因此结果不一致。 “如果我得到这份清单，我可能会把它扔进垃圾桶，因为它完全没用，”Shevat 说。

In the meantime, managers and other senior employees began receiving calls late at night from the Goons. “Who are the best people on your team?” they would ask. “Who’s critical? Who’s _technical_?”  
与此同时，经理和其他高级员工开始在深夜接到 Goons 打来的电话。 “谁是你团队中最好的人？”他们会问。 “谁是批评家？谁有技术？”

The questions reflected Musk’s certainty that Twitter could be run with a relatively small number of top engineers — and almost no one else. Meanwhile, managers were fielding worried questions from workers, but the only one that mattered — “Will I still have a job here?” — no one could answer. The _New York Times_ reported that one engineering manager puked in a trash can after being told to cut hundreds of workers. Even Shevat didn’t know if his position was safe.  
这些问题反映出马斯克确信 Twitter 可以由相对较少的顶级工程师来运营——几乎没有其他人。与此同时，经理们正在回答工人们提出的令人担忧的问题，但唯一重要的问题是——“我还会在这里找到工作吗？” ——没人能回答。 《纽约时报》报道说，一位工程经理在被告知要裁掉数百名工人后吐在垃圾桶里。就连谢瓦特也不知道自己的位置是否安全。

Soon another new directive came from above: Large meetings were banned. Musk and the Goons were wary of sabotage from soon-to-be-fired workers and didn’t want to risk any of them getting a warning before they were cut. The message was “group meetings are no longer a thing,” Shevat recalls. “And if you do that, you risk getting fired.”  
不久上面又传来了一条新指令：禁止举行大型会议。马斯克和 Goons 对即将被解雇的工人的破坏持谨慎态度，不想让他们中的任何一个在被裁员之前得到警告。 Shevat 回忆说，信息是“小组会议不再是一回事”。 “如果你这样做，你就有被解雇的风险。”

“When your team is pushing round the clock to make deadlines sometimes you #SleepWhereYouWork,” she said.  
“当你的团队夜以继日地赶上最后期限时，有时你会#SleepWhereYouWork，”她说。

Shevat had been scheduled to meet with Sacks at 1 p.m. to walk him through the developer platform’s product road map. (Musk was technically Shevat’s direct manager, but the two never met one-on-one.) Every hour, an assistant messaged Shevat to say the meeting was delayed. When it finally began, around 8 p.m., Shevat explained what his team did — they ran the services that allowed outside developers to create apps that connected to Twitter, a feature of any major platform. It would be a crucial component if Musk pursued his publicly stated aspiration to make Twitter a “super-app” like WeChat, which has a thriving economy of mini-apps made by outside engineers.  
Shevat 原定于下午 1 点与 Sacks 会面。引导他了解开发者平台的产品路线图。 （从技术上讲，马斯克是 Shevat 的直接经理，但两人从未进行过一对一会面。）每隔一个小时，一位助理就会给 Shevat 发消息说会议被推迟了。晚上 8 点左右终于开始时，Shevat 解释了他的团队所做的事情——他们运行的服务允许外部开发人员创建连接到 Twitter 的应用程序，这是任何主要平台的一个功能。如果马斯克实现他公开表示的将 Twitter 打造成像微信这样的“超级应用”的愿望，这将是一个关键组成部分，微信拥有蓬勃发展的外部工程师开发的迷你应用经济。

Shevat thought Sacks seemed bored — he spent most of the meeting checking his phone. “He didn’t want to understand anything,” Shevat says. It made him want to cry, especially since he had actually been eager to work with Musk. “I would have worked really hard for him,” he says.  
Shevat 认为 Sacks 似乎很无聊——他在会议的大部分时间里都在看手机。 “他什么都不想了解，”谢瓦特说。这让他想哭，尤其是他其实很想和马斯克一起工作。 “我会为他努力工作，”他说。

Similar meetings were taking place across the company. Musk had imported dozens of engineers from his other organizations — including Tesla, Neuralink, and the Boring Company — to help run Twitter and cull its staff. Two of his cousins, Andrew and James Musk, were added to the employee directory.  
类似的会议正在整个公司举行。马斯克从他的其他组织——包括特斯拉、Neuralink 和 Boring Company——引进了数十名工程师来帮助运营 Twitter 并裁员。他的两个堂兄弟，安德鲁和詹姆斯马斯克，被添加到员工名录中。

Twitter employees were soon either sitting around waiting to be fired or placed on Musk projects, pulling all-nighters at the office and trying to meet arbitrary deadlines, even as product plans changed by the day (and were often announced on Musk’s Twitter feed). If they didn’t meet their deadlines, they were told, they’d be fired — a fate that, to some, looked increasingly desirable.  
Twitter 员工很快要么坐等被解雇，要么安排在马斯克的项目上，他们在办公室通宵达旦并试图在任意期限内完成任务，即使产品计划每天都在变化（并且经常在马斯克的 Twitter 提要上宣布）。他们被告知，如果他们没有在最后期限前完成任务，就会被解雇——对一些人来说，这种命运看起来越来越令人向往。

The following week, on November 3, employees received an unsigned email from “Twitter” relaying that the time for layoffs had started. By 9 a.m. the following day, everyone would receive a note telling them whether they still had a job.  
接下来的一周，也就是 11 月 3 日，员工收到了一封来自“推特”的未署名电子邮件，告知裁员时间已经开始。到第二天早上 9 点，每个人都会收到一张纸条，告诉他们是否还有工作。

“From ‘Twitter’ looool what fucking cowards,” a former employee said by text. “Your people are Twitter you shits.”   
“从‘推特’上看，他妈的胆小鬼，”一位前雇员通过短信说。 “你的人就是 Twitter，你这狗屎。”

That night, hundreds of employees gathered in a Slack channel called #social-watercooler, which had become the company’s de facto town square since Musk took over. They posted salute emoji and blue hearts — solidarity for those who were being cut and for those who deeply wanted to be shown the door but were somehow asked to stay. One person posted a meme of Thanos from _Avengers: Infinity War,_ the supervillain who exterminates half the living beings in the universe with a snap.  
那天晚上，数百名员工聚集在一个名为#social-watercooler 的 Slack 频道，自马斯克接管以来，该频道已成为公司事实上的城镇广场。他们张贴了致敬的表情符号和蓝色的心——声援那些被裁员的人，以及那些深切希望被带回家但不知何故被要求留下来的人。有人发布了《复仇者联盟：无限战争》中灭霸的表情包，这位超级大反派瞬间消灭了宇宙中一半的生物。

By morning, 50 percent of the workforce had lost their jobs, well over 3,000 people. “The alternation between relief about being done, sadness about \[waves at gaps and fires where there was cool people / hope\], anxiety that Musk might fuck with severance, and exhaustion at thought of interviewing is a bit much,” wrote the same former employee, “but veering towards relief.”  
到早上，50% 的劳动力失去了工作，超过 3,000 人。 “在对完成的宽慰、对\[有酷人的空隙和火灾的波浪 / 希望\]的悲伤、对马斯克可能会被遣散费操心的焦虑，以及一想到面试就精疲力竭之间的交替，”同一个前者写道员工，“但转向救济。”

The worker left a message for Twitter leadership in a main Slack channel before their access was cut: “news articles aren’t comms. Tweets from an account associated with half-baked rants, copy pasted memes, and the occasional misinfo aren’t comms. Secondhand internal sharing and employee sleuthing aren’t comms … I also hope failure of this past week hangs heavy on you to remind you to do better.”  
在他们的访问权限被切断之前，这名工作人员在 Slack 的一个主要频道上给 Twitter 领导层留言：“新闻文章不是通讯。来自与半生不熟的咆哮、复制粘贴的模因和偶尔的错误信息相关的帐户的推文不是通讯。二手内部分享和员工调查不是通讯……我也希望过去一周的失败对你来说是沉重的负担，以提醒你做得更好。”

To avoid violating federal labor law, Musk said employees would be paid for the next two months, though they would lose access to Twitter’s systems immediately. But even this played out haphazardly; some workers lost access on schedule, while others lingered in Twitter’s critical systems for months.   
为避免违反联邦劳动法，马斯克表示员工将在接下来的两个月内获得报酬，但他们将立即失去对 Twitter 系统的访问权限。但即使这样也很随意；一些员工无法按计划访问，而另一些员工则在 Twitter 的关键系统中徘徊了数月之久。

The layoffs wiped out Shevat and his entire team. Alicia kept her position, as she’d expected, but was left with survivor’s guilt. She started quietly encouraging her workers to prepare an exit strategy.  
裁员彻底摧毁了谢瓦特和他的整个团队。正如她所预料的那样，艾丽西亚保留了她的立场，但留下了幸存者的罪恶感。她开始悄悄地鼓励她的员工准备退出策略。

Moments of institutional chaos are always someone’s opportunity, and at Twitter, that person was a product manager named Esther Crawford. Before the takeover, Crawford had been focused on products that let creators make money from their Twitter accounts and one that allowed users to show NFTs on their profiles. When Musk arrived, she began angling for a bigger role. She introduced herself to him on the first day as he mingled with employees at headquarters and soon was pitching him on various ways Twitter could be improved.  
机构混乱的时刻总是有人的机会，而在 Twitter，那个人是一位名叫 Esther Crawford 的产品经理。在接管之前，克劳福德一直专注于让创作者从他们的 Twitter 账户赚钱的产品，以及允许用户在他们的个人资料上展示 NFT 的产品。当马斯克到来时，她开始争取一个更大的角色。第一天，当他与总部的员工混在一起时，她向他作了自我介绍，很快就向他推销了可以改进 Twitter 的各种方式。

It worked: Crawford was tasked with relaunching Twitter’s subscription product, Twitter Blue. The feature would allow users to pay $8 to get verified and, Musk hoped, wean the company off its dependency on advertisers. The two people who once led the subscription effort were ousted, making Crawford one of the company’s most prominent product leaders. In early November, she posted a picture of herself in an eye mask and sleeping bag at the office: “When your team is pushing round the clock to make deadlines sometimes you #SleepWhereYouWork,” [she said](https://twitter.com/esthercrawford/status/1587709705488830464?lang=en).   
它奏效了：克劳福德的任务是重新推出 Twitter 的订阅产品 Twitter Blue。该功能将允许用户支付 8 美元来获得验证，马斯克希望，这可以让公司摆脱对广告商的依赖。曾经领导订阅工作的两个人被罢免，使克劳福德成为公司最杰出的产品领导者之一。 11 月初，她在办公室张贴了一张自己戴着眼罩和睡袋的照片：“当你的团队夜以继日地赶在截止日期之前，有时你会#SleepWhereYouWork，”她说。

Even the mass layoffs didn’t deter her. “I feel heartbroken that this process has required many good people to leave Twitter, but the business was not profitable and drastic cuts were going to be required to survive, no matter who owned the company,” she wrote on Slack, further alienating herself from colleagues. (Crawford declined to comment.)  
即使是大规模裁员也没有阻止她。她在 Slack 上写道：“我感到心碎的是，这个过程需要很多优秀的人离开 Twitter，但该公司没有盈利，而且无论谁拥有公司，都需要大幅裁员才能生存，”她进一步疏远了自己同事。 （克劳福德拒绝置评。）

Musk had made it clear he wanted to do away with Twitter’s old verification method, which he called a “lords & peasants system.” To be verified — a symbol that an account had been vetted as authentic — a user had to be approved by someone at Twitter. Blue check marks mostly went to brands, celebrities, and journalists, reinforcing Musk’s belief that the platform was tilted in favor of media elites.  
马斯克明确表示他想废除 Twitter 的旧验证方法，他称之为“领主与农民系统”。要进行验证——一个帐户被审查为真实的标志——用户必须得到 Twitter 某人的批准。蓝色复选标记主要用于品牌、名人和记者，强化了马斯克的信念，即该平台向媒体精英倾斜。

To correct this imbalance, Musk wanted to implement a crude pay-to-play scheme. After originally proposing to charge $20 a month for verification, he was talked down to $8 after Stephen King [tweeted at his 7 million followers](https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/1587042605627490304), “$20 a month to keep my blue check? Fuck that, they should pay me. If that gets instituted, I’m gone like Enron.”  
为了纠正这种不平衡，马斯克想实施一种粗略的按需付费计划。在最初提议每月收取 20 美元的验证费用后，在斯蒂芬金向他的 700 万粉丝发推文后，他被降到了 8 美元，“每月 20 美元来保留我的蓝色支票？他妈的，他们应该付钱给我。如果它得到实施，我就会像安然一样消失。”

“The engineers I am bringing back are weak, lazy, unmotivated, and they may even be against an Elon Twitter. They were cut for a reason.”  
“我带回来的工程师软弱、懒惰、没有动力，他们甚至可能反对埃隆的推特。他们被裁掉是有原因的。”

Twitter’s trust and safety team compiled a seven-page document outlining the dangers associated with paid verification. What would stop people from impersonating politicians or brands? They ranked the risk a “P0,” the highest possible. But Musk and his team refused to take any recommendations that would delay the launch.  
Twitter 的信任与安全团队编制了一份长达七页的文件，概述了与付费验证相关的危险。什么会阻止人们冒充政客或品牌？他们将风险列为“P0”，即可能的最高风险。但马斯克和他的团队拒绝采纳任何会延迟发射的建议。

Twitter Blue’s paid verification system was unveiled on November 5. Almost immediately, fake verified accounts flooded the platform. An image of Mario giving the middle finger from what looked like the official Nintendo account stayed up for more than a day. An account masquerading as the drug manufacturer Eli Lilly tweeted that insulin would now be free; company executives begged Twitter to take down the tweet. The marketing team tried to do damage control. “You build trust by being transparent, predictable, and thoughtful,” one former employee says. “We were none of those with this launch.”  
Twitter Blue 的付费验证系统于 11 月 5 日亮相。几乎立即，经过验证的虚假账户充斥了该平台。一张马里奥竖起中指的图片，看起来像是任天堂官方账号上的一张图片，在网上停留了一天多。一个伪装成制药商礼来公司的账户在推特上说胰岛素现在可以免费使用了；公司高管请求 Twitter 撤下这条推文。营销团队试图进行损害控制。 “你可以通过透明、可预测和深思熟虑来建立信任，”一位前雇员说。 “我们不是这次发布的人。”

Days after the subscription service debuted, Twitter canned it. Yoel Roth, the head of the team whose warnings had been ignored, resigned. In an all-hands meeting, Musk vowed not to relaunch Twitter Blue until the company had gotten a handle on impersonators. (Shortly after he did, in mid-December, ostensibly with defenses in place, a columnist for the _Washington_ _Post_ [managed to get a fake account for a U.S. senator verified](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/01/05/twitter-blue-verification/).)   
订阅服务推出几天后，Twitter 就取消了它。警告被忽视的团队负责人约尔·罗斯辞职了。在一次全体会议上，马斯克发誓在公司控制好模仿者之前不会重新启动 Twitter Blue。 （就在他这样做后不久，在 12 月中旬，华盛顿邮报的一位专栏作家表面上采取了防御措施，设法让一位美国参议员的假账户得到验证。）

Musk’s blundering left a deep scar. Twitter Blue was meant to begin shifting Twitter’s sales away from ads toward subscriptions. But while chasing a relatively paltry new cash stream, Musk torched the company’s ad business — the source of the vast majority of its billions in revenue. The Blue disaster accelerated a rush of advertisers abandoning the platform, including Eli Lilly, and by December, what was left of Twitter’s sales team began offering hundreds of thousands of dollars in free ad spend to lure back marketers. ([It did not work.](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/twitters-efforts-to-court-advertisers-turns-them-off))   
马斯克的失误留下了深深的伤痕。 Twitter Blue 旨在开始将 Twitter 的销售从广告转向订阅。但是，在追逐相对微不足道的新现金流的同时，马斯克点燃了公司的广告业务——这是其数十亿美元收入中绝大部分的来源。 Blue 灾难加速了包括礼来在内的广告商纷纷放弃该平台，到 12 月，Twitter 销售团队剩下的部分开始提供数十万美元的免费广告支出，以吸引营销人员回来。 （ 那没起效。 ）

In a series of tweets, Musk blamed the company’s “massive drop in revenue” on “activist groups pressuring advertisers.” To Musk, it was anyone’s fault but his own.  
在一系列推文中，马斯克将公司“收入大幅下降”归咎于“激进组织向广告商施压”。对马斯克来说，这是任何人的错，除了他自己。

The layoffs had left teams in charge of Twitter’s most critical infrastructure and user experience with a skeletal staff. Many managers hadn’t been consulted about which of their employees would be fired; after the rapture, they used Google Docs to create lists of workers who still seemed to be active. Then they started angling to rehire some people who had been cut.  
裁员让负责 Twitter 最关键的基础设施和用户体验的团队只剩下了骨干员工。许多经理没有被征求他们的哪些员工将被解雇的意见；狂喜过后，他们使用谷歌文档创建了似乎仍然活跃的工人名单。然后他们开始设法重新雇用一些被裁掉的人。

A debate broke out in the company’s Slack channels. Luke Simon didn’t like the idea of bringing engineers back. Then he did an about-face, angling to bring four recently fired workers onto his team, but not without reservations he aired on Slack. “This is going to be the challenge,” he wrote. “The engineers I am bringing back are weak, lazy, unmotivated, and they may even be against an Elon Twitter. They were cut for a reason.” Ella Irwin, a vice-president, said she had discussed the issue with Musk and reported that he was a “hard no” on rehiring.   
该公司的 Slack 频道爆发了一场辩论。卢克西蒙不喜欢让工程师回来的想法。然后他来了个大转弯，想办法让四名最近被解雇的员工加入他的团队，但他并非毫无保留地在 Slack 上播出。 “这将是一个挑战，”他写道。 “我带回来的工程师软弱、懒惰、没有动力，他们甚至可能反对埃隆的推特。他们被裁掉是有原因的。”副总裁埃拉·欧文 (Ella Irwin) 表示，她已经与马斯克讨论了这个问题，并表示他“坚决拒绝”重新招聘。

The weekend after the layoffs, Musk reversed himself. Twitter’s remaining employees were told they could ask anyone who was fired to come back — with approval from leadership. The directive was given on Saturday, and managers were given till Sunday afternoon to share their lists of whom they wanted to un–lay off.  
裁员后的周末，马斯克改变了自己。 Twitter 的剩余员工被告知，他们可以要求任何被解雇的人回来——前提是得到领导层的批准。该指令是在星期六发出的，经理们被要求在星期天下午之前分享他们想要解雇的人的名单。

Irwin herself had been fired, but Musk brought her back after Roth resigned. When she’d talked to Musk about taking the job, she brought up her concerns that Twitter executives had historically displayed a relentless focus on juicing the numbers that mattered to Wall Street, often at the expense of making Twitter safer. Musk reassured her that trust and safety would be top priorities and later told her team he didn’t “care about the impact on revenue.” “He’s like, ‘I want you to make the platform safe,’ ” she said. “ ‘If there’s ten other things that come before trust and safety, you’re really not going to be effective as a team.’ ” Irwin believed him. “In my conversation with Elon, what became very clear was he actually really, really, really cares about this, more so than other executives have.”  
欧文本人被解雇了，但马斯克在罗斯辞职后将她带了回来。当她与马斯克谈论接受这份工作时，她提出了自己的担忧，即 Twitter 高管历来表现出不懈的专注于榨取对华尔街重要的数字，而这往往以提高 Twitter 的安全性为代价。马斯克向她保证，信任和安全将是重中之重，后来告诉她的团队，他“不关心对收入的影响”。 “他说，‘我希望你能确保平台安全，’”她说。 “ ‘如果在信任和安全之前还有其他十件事，那么你们作为一个团队真的不会有效。’ ”欧文相信了他。 “在我与埃隆的谈话中，变得非常清楚的是，他实际上真的、真的、真的关心这个，比其他高管更关心。”

That commitment was immediately tested by being pitted against his other goal of “freeing” speech on Twitter. In the weeks after Musk took over, hate speech spiked across the platform. Slurs against gay men rose 58 percent, antisemitic language was up by 61 percent, and anti-Black slurs more than tripled, according to some estimates. Twitter claimed the rise in hate speech was temporary, but the basic situation was clear: Trolls were testing the boundaries of Musk’s commitment to open discourse.  
这一承诺立即受到考验，与他在 Twitter 上“自由”言论的另一个目标相提并论。在马斯克接手后的几周内，平台上的仇恨言论激增。据一些估计，针对男同性恋者的诽谤增加了 58%，反犹太主义语言增加了 61%，反黑人的诽谤增加了两倍多。推特声称仇恨言论的增加是暂时的，但基本情况很清楚：网络喷子正在测试马斯克承诺公开讨论的界限。

Musk said repeatedly that Twitter’s content-moderation approach should “hew close to the law,” yet speech laws are different in every country. In the U.S., many forms of hate speech and harassment are legal. But Germany has well-known laws against Nazism and Holocaust denial, and the government of India has wide latitude to request the takedown of speech they don’t like. Musk promised he would leave major decisions, such as whether to reinstate Trump’s account, to a council of experts. Then, on November 19, he reneged and made the decision via public Twitter poll.  
马斯克一再表示，Twitter 的内容审核方法应该“遵守法律”，但每个国家的言论法都不同。在美国，许多形式的仇恨言论和骚扰都是合法的。但德国有众所周知的反对纳粹主义和否认大屠杀的法律，印度政府有很大的自由度要求删除他们不喜欢的言论。马斯克承诺，他将把重大决定留给专家委员会，例如是否恢复特朗普的账户。然后，在 11 月 19 日，他反悔并通过公开推特民意调查做出了决定。

“The speed at which he moves and expects people to move can be dizzying, for sure,” Irwin says. She still supports Musk. “It’s probably the fastest-moving organization right now that I’ve ever seen in my life.”  
“他移动的速度和期望人们移动的速度肯定会令人眼花缭乱，”欧文说。她仍然支持马斯克。 “这可能是我一生中见过的目前发展最快的组织。”

A former employee saw the Trump decision differently: “It shattered the naïve illusion that moderation would be anything more than dancing to the whims of one man’s inflated ego.”  
一位前雇员对特朗普的决定有不同的看法：“它打破了天真的幻想，即节制只不过是随着一个人膨胀的自我的一时兴起而跳舞。”

On November 10, with just 20 minutes notice, Musk gathered his remaining employees to address them directly for the first time. He spoke frankly about the state of the business and suggested even more layoffs were to come. He also revoked a policy that had promised the entire staff the freedom to work remotely, forever, if they wished. “Basically, if you can show up in an office and you do not show up at the office, resignation accepted. End of story,” he said.  
11 月 10 日，在提前 20 分钟通知的情况下，马斯克首次召集剩余员工直接向他们讲话。他坦率地谈到了业务状况，并暗示将进行更多裁员。他还撤销了一项政策，该政策承诺全体员工可以自由地永远远程工作，如果他们愿意的话。 “基本上，如果你能出现在办公室而你没有出现在办公室，辞职就会被接受。故事结束，”他说。

Slack and Signal erupted. A lawyer pointed out that this would be a fundamental change to their employment contracts, and employees did not have “an obligation to return to office.” One person said, “That’s so low.” And later, “Ok I’m quitting tomorrow 😂”  
Slack 和 Signal 爆发了。一位律师指出，这将是对他们雇佣合同的根本性改变，员工没有“重返办公室的义务”。一个人说：“那太低了。”后来，“好吧，我明天不干了😂”

Alicia decided she too had had enough. She enjoyed working from the office but felt that forcing employees to do so, and on such short notice, was immoral. She told colleagues, first publicly in Slack, then on Twitter, not to resign. “Let him fire you,” she said. Why give Musk what he wanted? Five days later, she was fired. In her termination email, the HR department said her behavior had violated company policy. The next day, she went to the office to retrieve her belongings, sneaking in through the service elevator. She was surprised to feel more relieved than upset. She was free.  
艾丽西亚决定她也受够了。她喜欢在办公室工作，但觉得在如此短的时间内强迫员工这样做是不道德的。她告诉同事，先是在 Slack 上公开，然后是在 Twitter 上，不要辞职。 “让他解雇你吧，”她说。为什么要给马斯克他想要的东西？五天后，她被解雇了。在她的解雇邮件中，人力资源部表示她的行为违反了公司政策。第二天，她去办公室拿东西，从服务电梯偷偷溜进来。她很惊讶地感到如释重负而不是沮丧。她是自由的。

Twitter might have had a reputation as a left-leaning workforce, but there had always been a faction that disapproved of its progressive ideals. On Slack, some of these workers had formed a channel called #i-dissent, where they asked questions like why deadnaming a trans colleague was considered “bad.” When Musk announced he was buying the company, one of the more active i-dissenters was thrilled. “Elon’s my new boss and I’m stoked!” he wrote on LinkedIn. “I decided to send him a slack message. I figured you miss 100% of the shots you don’t make 😅 🚀 🌕”  
Twitter 可能以左倾劳动力而闻名，但一直有一个派系不赞成其进步理想。在 Slack 上，这些员工中的一些人建立了一个名为#i-dissent 的频道，他们在那里提出问题，例如为什么给跨性别同事取名被认为是“糟糕的”。当马斯克宣布他要收购这家公司时，一位更活跃的 i-disposers 非常激动。 “Elon 是我的新老板，我很兴奋！”他在领英上写道。 “我决定给他发一条松懈的信息。我认为您会错过 100% 的投篮

This employee was cut during the first round of layoffs. Soon, all the prominent members of the #i-dissent Slack channel would be gone. The channel itself was archived, while bigger social channels like #social-watercooler were abandoned.  
这名员工在第一轮裁员期间被裁掉了。很快，#i-dissent Slack 频道的所有知名成员都将消失。该频道本身已存档，而#social-watercooler 等更大的社交频道已被放弃。

On November 16, Musk emailed his remaining 2,900 employees an ultimatum. He was building Twitter 2.0, he said, and workers would need to be “extremely hardcore,” logging “long hours at high intensity.” The old way of doing business was out. Now, “only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade.” He asked employees to sign a pledge through Google Forms committing to the new standard by the end of the next workday.  
11 月 16 日，马斯克通过电子邮件向其剩余的 2,900 名员工发出了最后通牒。他说，他正在打造 Twitter 2.0，而工作人员需要“非常顽固”，“长时间高强度地记录”。旧的经商方式已经过时了。现在，“只有表现出色才能及格。”他要求员工在下一个工作日结束前通过 Google Forms 签署承诺书，承诺遵守新标准。

But who wanted that? Employees were still waiting to be given a coherent vision for what Twitter 2.0 could be. They lacked basic information about the new company, like how they would be compensated now that Twitter was no longer a public company with easily sellable stock. Employees knew what Musk didn’t want — content moderation, free gourmet lunches, people working from home — but had few clues as to what he did want. Besides, was being fired for not checking a box on a Google Form even legal?  
但谁想要那样呢？员工们仍在等待获得有关 Twitter 2.0 的清晰愿景。他们缺乏关于新公司的基本信息，比如既然 Twitter 不再是一家股票易于出售的上市公司，他们将如何获得补偿。员工们知道马斯克不想要什么——内容审核、免费美味午餐、人们在家工作——但对他真正想要什么却知之甚少。此外，是否因为不勾选 Google 表单上的复选框而被解雇甚至合法？

Word quickly spread that a significant number of employees were going to say no to being “extremely hardcore.” After weeks of trying to get rid of as many employees as possible, Musk and his advisers were suddenly in the awkward position of needing to convince a subset of them to stay. They met with small groups of senior engineers to hear their concerns. But to many, Musk’s handling of the initial layoffs, coupled with the lack of details about what staying for Twitter 2.0 would entail, had soured them for good. As one once-loyal engineer put it, “Fuck Elon Musk.”  
消息很快传开，大量员工将拒绝成为“极度顽固的人”。在试图解雇尽可能多的员工数周之后，马斯克和他的顾问们突然陷入了尴尬的境地，需要说服他们中的一部分人留下来。他们会见了一小群高级工程师，听取他们的担忧。但对许多人来说，马斯克对最初裁员的处理方式，再加上缺乏关于留在 Twitter 2.0 需要什么的细节，让他们永远感到厌恶。正如一位曾经忠诚的工程师所说，“操 Elon Musk。”

Hundreds of employees decided not to sign the pledge, effectively resigning. In Slack, they again posted the salute emoji, the unofficial symbol of Twitter 1.0: 🫡  
数百名员工决定不签署承诺，实际上是辞职。在 Slack 中，他们再次发布了敬礼表情符号，这是 Twitter 1.0 的非官方符号：🫡

Four days later, Musk took the stage at Twitter headquarters. He was dressed in black jeans and black boots with a black T-shirt that read “I Love Twitter” in barely legible black writing. Flanked by two bodyguards, he tried to articulate his vision for the company. “This is not a right-wing takeover of Twitter,” he told employees. “It is a moderate-wing takeover of Twitter.”  
四天后，马斯克在 Twitter 总部登台。他穿着黑色牛仔裤和黑色靴子，黑色 T 恤上用几乎难以辨认的黑色字体写着“我爱推特”。在两名保镖的陪同下，他试图阐明他对公司的愿景。 “这不是右翼对 Twitter 的收购，”他告诉员工。 “这是对 Twitter 的温和派接管。”

As employees peppered him with questions, the billionaire free-associated, answering their concerns with smug dismissals and grandiose promises. What about his plan to turn Twitter from a mere social network into a super-app? “You’re not getting it, you’re not understanding,” he said, sounding frustrated. “I just used WeChat as an example. We can’t freakin’ clone WeChat; that would be absurd.” What about rival social platforms? “I don’t think about competitors … I don’t care what Facebook, YouTube, or what anyone else is doing. Couldn’t give a damn. We just need to make Twitter as goddamn amazing as possible.” What about rebuilding Twitter’s leadership team that he’d decimated in his first week? “Initially, there will be a lot of changes, and then over time you’ll see far fewer changes.”   
当员工向他提出问题时，这位亿万富翁自由联想，以沾沾自喜的解雇和宏大的承诺来回答他们的担忧。他将 Twitter 从单纯的社交网络转变为超级应用程序的计划如何？ “你不明白，你不理解，”他说，听起来很沮丧。 “我只是以微信为例。我们不能克隆微信；那将是荒谬的。竞争对手的社交平台呢？ “我不考虑竞争对手……我不在乎 Facebook、YouTube 或其他任何人在做什么。根本不在乎。我们只需要让 Twitter 尽可能地令人惊叹。”如何重建他在第一周就摧毁的 Twitter 领导团队？ “最初，会有很多变化，然后随着时间的推移，你会看到更少的变化。”

Twitter employees were used to grilling their bosses about every detail of how the company ran, an openness that was common at major tech companies around Silicon Valley. Even employees who still believed in Musk’s vision of Twitter hoped for a similar dialogue with their leader. Some expected it, now that the slackers were gone. But over the course of half an hour, Musk made it clear that the two-way street between the CEO and staffers was now closed.  
Twitter 员工习惯于就公司运营的每一个细节盘问他们的老板，这种开放态度在硅谷周围的主要科技公司中很常见。即使是仍然相信马斯克对 Twitter 愿景的员工也希望与他们的领导进行类似的对话。有些人预料到了，既然懒鬼不见了。但在半小时内，马斯克明确表示，CEO 和员工之间的双向通道现已关闭。

By December, more than half the staff was gone, along with all of Twitter’s major perks, including reimbursements for wellness, classes, and day care. Remaining employees were warned not to take long Christmas vacations. Just when morale seemed to be bottoming out, Musk began doxxing their colleagues.   
到 12 月，超过一半的员工离开了，连同 Twitter 的所有主要福利，包括健康、课程和日托的报销。其余员工被警告不要休长圣诞假。就在士气似乎触底的时候，马斯克开始对他们的同事进行人肉攻击。

Only a small inner circle knew Musk had invited the journalist Matt Taibbi to comb through internal documents and publish what he called “the Twitter Files.” The intention seemed to be to give credence to the notion that Twitter is in bed with the deep state, beholden to the clandestine conspiracies of Democrats. “Twitter is both a social media company and a crime scene,” [Musk tweeted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1601667312930590721).  
只有一小部分核心圈子知道马斯克邀请记者马特泰比梳理内部文件并发布他所谓的“推特文件”。其意图似乎是让人们相信 Twitter 与深层政府密不可分，受制于民主党的秘密阴谋。 “推特既是一家社交媒体公司，也是一个犯罪现场，”马斯克在推特上写道。

In an impossible-to-follow tweet thread that unfolded over several hours, Taibbi published the names and emails of rank-and-file ex-employees involved in communications with government officials, insinuating that Twitter had suppressed the _New York Post_ story about Hunter Biden’s laptop. After it was pointed out that Taibbi had published the personal email of Jack Dorsey, that tweet was deleted, but not the tweets naming low-level employees or the personal email of a sitting congressman.   
在几个小时内展开的一条无法追踪的推文中，泰比公布了参与与政府官员沟通的普通前雇员的姓名和电子邮件，暗示推特压制了《纽约邮报》关于亨特·拜登的报道笔记本电脑。在有人指出 Taibbi 发布了 Jack Dorsey 的个人电子邮件后，该推文被删除，但没有删除指定低级别员工的推文或现任国会议员的个人电子邮件。

“What a shitty thing to do,” one worker wrote in a large Slack channel of former employees. “The names of rank and file members being revealed is fucked,” wrote another. Employees rushed to warn a Twitter operations analyst whom Taibbi had doxxed to privatize her social-media accounts, knowing she was about to face a deluge of abuse.  
“这是多么糟糕的事情，”一名员工在一个由前员工组成的大型 Slack 频道中写道。另一位写道：“泄露普通成员的名字真是操蛋。”员工们急忙警告一位 Twitter 运营分析师，泰比曾对她进行人肉攻击，让她将自己的社交媒体账户私有化，因为她知道她将面临大量的辱骂。

It’s an open secret that many employees who remain at Musk’s “hardcore” Twitter are actively looking for other jobs.  
一个公开的秘密是，许多留在马斯克“硬核”推特的员工正在积极寻找其他工作。

Soon after, Musk granted access to others, including Bari Weiss and Michael Shellenberger, two influential writers who had gained the approval of his social circle, including David Sacks. They published Twitter threads on the company’s handling of covid misinformation and shadow-banning. While the framing was intended to stoke outrage, the internal correspondence that was published was more banal. It mostly showed employees having nuanced discussions about complicated, thorny moderation topics and often resisting requests by government agencies to take action. What Musk saw as damning forms of censorship were actually thoughtful conversations about user safety.  
不久之后，马斯克授予其他人访问权限，包括巴里韦斯和迈克尔谢伦伯格，这两位有影响力的作家获得了他的社交圈的认可，包括大卫萨克斯。他们发布了关于公司处理 covid 错误信息和影子禁令的 Twitter 线程。虽然框架是为了激起愤怒，但发布的内部信件更为平庸。它主要显示员工对复杂、棘手的节制主题进行了微妙的讨论，并且经常拒绝政府机构采取行动的要求。马斯克眼中的诅咒审查制度实际上是关于用户安全的深思熟虑的对话。

Musk followed this with a personal attack on Yoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety. After Musk suggested that Roth was sympathetic to pedophilia — a dog whistle harking back to QAnon and Pizzagate — Roth fled his home and went into hiding.   
随后，马斯克对 Twitter 前信任与安全负责人 Yoel Roth 进行了人身攻击。在马斯克暗示罗斯同情恋童癖之后——一种让人想起 QAnon 和 Pizzagate 的狗哨——罗斯逃离了家，躲了起来。

At the same time as he was putting Roth at risk, Musk bent the company’s free-speech policies to protect himself. After one of his children was allegedly stalked by a fan in South Pasadena, Musk blamed a Twitter account that tracked public data about the whereabouts of his private jet — his “assassination coordinates,” Musk said. He then had Irwin suspend the @ElonJet account, the account of its owner, and dozens of others that tracked celebrities’ planes. Several journalists from CNN, the _New York Times,_ and elsewhere were suspended for tweeting the news. After she was publicly connected with the @ElonJet ban, a former employee says Irwin began insisting that instructions to restore accounts only be delivered verbally, so that the moves would not be linked back to her in Twitter’s systems. (Irwin denies this.)  
在将罗斯置于危险之中的同时，马斯克还违反了公司的言论自由政策来保护自己。在他的一个孩子据称在南帕萨迪纳被一名粉丝跟踪后，马斯克将责任归咎于一个 Twitter 账户，该账户追踪了有关他的私人飞机下落的公共数据——他的“暗杀坐标”，马斯克说。然后，他让 Irwin 暂停了@ElonJet 帐户、其所有者的帐户以及其他数十个跟踪名人飞机的帐户。 CNN、纽约时报和其他地方的几名记者因在推特上发布该消息而被停职。在她公开与@ElonJet 禁令有关后，一位前雇员表示，欧文开始坚持只能口头传达恢复账户的指示，这样这些举动就不会在 Twitter 的系统中与她相关联。 （欧文否认了这一点。）

Even Musk’s new ally Weiss denounced the crackdown: “The old regime at Twitter governed by its own whims and biases and it sure looks like the new regime has the same problem. I oppose it in both cases.” Musk responded by unfollowing her.  
就连马斯克的新盟友魏斯也谴责了这次镇压：“推特的旧政权受制于自己的奇思妙想和偏见，看起来新政权肯定也有同样的问题。在这两种情况下我都反对。马斯克的回应是取消关注她。

Twitter continues to hemorrhage money, so much so that Musk has stopped paying its bills. The landlords of one of its spaces in San Francisco are suing, seeking damages and threatening eviction proceedings. Twitter plans to [auction off office furniture in January](https://www.curbed.com/2022/12/elon-musk-twitter-auction-cafeteria-san-francisco.html).  
推特继续流失资金，以至于马斯克已经停止支付账单。它在旧金山的一个空间的房东正在提起诉讼，要求赔偿损失并威胁要进行驱逐程序。 Twitter 计划在一月份拍卖办公家具。

On Christmas Eve, Twitter abruptly shut down a data center in Sacramento, one of the company’s three serving regions; it also announced it would significantly downsize a data center in Atlanta. Within hours, Twitter had to redirect a large amount of traffic to its remaining data centers, threatening the stability of the platform. Engineers struggled to keep the service running. Outages would happen sporadically, the worst one in January, when the site was [down for over 12 hours for users in Australia and New Zealand](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/04/twitter-goes-down-for-many-in-australia-users-say/). But it was nothing near the catastrophe Musk’s critics had predicted. Mostly, Twitter kept humming along.  
平安夜，Twitter 突然关闭了公司三个服务区域之一萨克拉门托的一个数据中心；它还宣布将大幅缩减亚特兰大数据中心的规模。几个小时内，Twitter 不得不将大量流量重定向到其剩余的数据中心，威胁到平台的稳定性。工程师们努力保持服务运行。中断会偶尔发生，最严重的一次发生在 1 月份，当时澳大利亚和新西兰的用户网站停机超过 12 小时。但这与马斯克的批评者所预测的灾难相去甚远。大多数情况下，推特一直在嗡嗡作响。

Meanwhile, more staff deemed nonessential were let go. In London, receptionists were fired just before the holiday. In San Francisco, the janitorial staff was laid off without severance. At one point, the San Francisco office got so low on office supplies that employees began bringing their own toilet paper.   
与此同时，更多被认为无关紧要的员工被解雇。在伦敦，接待员在假期前被解雇了。在旧金山，清洁人员在没有遣散费的情况下被解雇。有一次，旧金山办公室的办公用品非常匮乏，员工们开始自带卫生纸。

Late in December, Twitter employees noticed a prominent face was gone from Slack: Luke Simon had left the company. No one knew why. Some joked darkly that kissing Musk’s ring wasn’t enough to keep anyone safe anymore. Simon’s Twitter account no longer exists. (He did not respond to a request for comment.)  
12 月下旬，Twitter 员工注意到 Slack 上消失了一张显眼的面孔：Luke Simon 离开了公司。没有人知道为什么。有些人开玩笑说，亲吻马斯克的戒指已经不足以保证任何人的安全了。西蒙的 Twitter 帐户已不存在。 （他没有回应置评请求。）

The repercussions for Musk’s handling of Twitter are now coming. According to his public-merger agreement and internal Twitter documents, Musk agreed to at least match the company’s existing severance package, which offered two months of pay as well as other valuable benefits. Instead, he laid off employees with the minimum notice required by federal and state law and refused to pay out certain awards. Now more than 500 employees, with Shevat among the highest ranking, are pursuing legal action against Musk for what they are owed, in addition to his alleged discrimination against minority groups in his handling of the layoffs.  
马斯克处理 Twitter 的后果现在即将到来。根据他的公开合并协议和 Twitter 内部文件，马斯克同意至少与公司现有的遣散费相当，该遣散费提供两个月的工资以及其他有价值的福利。相反，他在联邦和州法律要求的最短通知后解雇了员工，并拒绝支付某些奖励。现在有超过 500 名员工，其中 Shevat 位列最高，正在对马斯克提起法律诉讼，追究他们的欠款，以及他涉嫌在处理裁员时歧视少数群体的行为。

“I think leadership doesn’t end after you get fired,” says Shevat, adding that he was already paid out for the acquisition of his start-up and isn’t doing this for the money. “I still feel responsible for my team and for my PMs and for my engineers. So I think that this is my way of showing them what is the right thing to do.”  
“我认为在你被解雇后，领导地位并没有结束，”Shevat 说，并补充说他已经为收购他的初创公司付出了代价，而且这样做并不是为了钱。 “我仍然觉得对我的团队、我的产品经理和我的工程师负有责任。所以我认为这是我向他们展示什么是正确的事情的方式。”

Originally, laid-off employees were given a 60-day notice. Now that it is up, they are receiving severance agreements asking them to sign away their right to sue Twitter or say anything negative about the company or Musk for life. In exchange, they get one month of pay before they need to find another job during what is the most difficult hiring market in tech in years.  
最初，下岗员工会提前 60 天收到通知。现在一切都结束了，他们正在收到遣散协议，要求他们签署放弃起诉 Twitter 或终身对公司或马斯克发表任何负面言论的权利。作为交换，他们可以在科技行业多年来最困难的招聘市场中找到另一份工作之前得到一个月的工资。

It’s an open secret that many employees who remain at Musk’s “hardcore” Twitter are actively looking for other jobs. Even the most publicly cheerful Twitter workers can’t fully mask the despair. On December 29, [one tweeted a selfie](https://twitter.com/theuaguy/status/1608437078320185344), smiling in front of an empty office, with the hashtags #solowork, #productivity, and #findingperspective.  
一个公开的秘密是，许多留在马斯克“硬核”推特的员工正在积极寻找其他工作。即使是最公开欢快的 Twitter 员工也无法完全掩盖绝望。 12 月 29 日，有人在推特上发布了一张在空荡荡的办公室前微笑的自拍照，标签为#solowork、#productivity 和#findingperspective。

Musk himself is starting to appear defeated. Tesla shares started 2022 trading at nearly $400. By September, Tesla’s stock price had dropped by 25 percent. It plummeted again after Musk bought Twitter and ended the year at $123. Investors are begging Musk to step away; Tesla employees are too. As one person on Musk’s transition team put it, “What the fuck does this have to do with cars?”  
马斯克本人开始显得失败了。 2022 年初，特斯拉股价接近 400 美元。到 9 月，特斯拉的股价下跌了 25%。在马斯克收购 Twitter 并在年底以 123 美元收盘后，它再次暴跌。投资者恳求马斯克下台；特斯拉员工也是。正如马斯克过渡团队的一名成员所说，“这他妈的和汽车有什么关系？”

Musk claims he always intended to be Twitter’s CEO only temporarily. With the damage he has done in three months — to the company and to his own wealth — those watching the nosedive, whether with horror or Schadenfreude, can’t help but wonder how much longer he can wait. His failures at Twitter have already damaged his reputation as a genius. How smart could he really be, the guy who purchased a company for far more than it was worth, then drove what remained of it into the earth?  
马斯克声称他一直打算暂时担任 Twitter 的首席执行官。考虑到他在三个月内对公司和他自己的财富造成的损害，那些目睹这一切的人，无论是惊恐还是幸灾乐祸，都忍不住想知道他还能等多久。他在推特上的失败已经损害了他作为天才的声誉。他究竟有多聪明，一个以远高于其价值的价格购买了一家公司，然后将其剩余部分投入地球的人？

While both companies flail, Musk remains glued to his feed. It was an outcome Alicia predicted back in April when Musk first floated the idea of buying the company. “He’s too interested in seeking attention,” she said. “Twitter is a very, a very dangerous drug for anybody who has that personality.”  
虽然这两家公司都陷入困境，但马斯克仍然专注于他的饲料。早在 4 月份，当马斯克首次提出收购该公司的想法时，艾丽西亚就预测到了这一结果。 “他太想引起注意了，”她说。 “对于任何具有这种性格的人来说，Twitter 都是一种非常、非常危险的毒品。”

As the year came to a close, Musk’s public statements about Twitter veered from pride in the site’s usage metrics (all-time highs, he regularly assured followers) to what might have been more sober self-assessments of his predicament. “Don’t be the clown on the clown car!” [he tweeted on December 27.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1607850458554449920) “Too late haha.”  
随着这一年的结束，马斯克关于 Twitter 的公开声明从对该网站的使用指标（历史最高水平，他经常向追随者保证）的自豪转变为对他的困境进行更清醒的自我评估。 “别做小丑车上的小丑！”他在 12 月 27 日发了推文。“太晚了，哈哈。”

If he seemed certain of anything, it was the steadily improving technical architecture of Twitter itself. The staff might be vastly diminished, but what it lacked in size it more than made up for in growing technical competence. Bit by bit, Musk said, Twitter’s notoriously fragile infrastructure was improving.   
如果他似乎对任何事情都非常确定的话，那就是 Twitter 本身不断改进的技术架构。员工人数可能会大大减少，但它在规模上的不足却在不断增长的技术能力方面得到了弥补。马斯克说，Twitter 臭名昭著的脆弱基础设施正在一点一点地改善。

In some ways, Musk was vindicated. Twitter was less stable now, but the platform survived and mostly functioned even with the majority of employees gone. He had promised to rightsize a bloated company, and now it operated on minimal head count.  
在某些方面，马斯克被证明是正确的。 Twitter 现在不太稳定，但该平台幸存下来，并且在大多数员工离职后仍能基本正常运行。他曾承诺对一家臃肿的公司进行精简，而现在它的运营人数最少。

But Musk appears unaware of what he’s actually broken: the company culture that built Twitter into one of the world’s most influential social networks, the policies that attempted to keep that platform safe, and the trust of users who populate it every day with their conversations, breaking news, and weird jokes — Twitter’s true value and contributions to the world.  
但马斯克似乎并没有意识到他实际上被打破的是什么：将 Twitter 打造成世界上最具影响力的社交网络之一的公司文化、试图保护该平台安全的政策，以及每天通过对话填充它的用户的信任，突发新闻和奇怪的笑话 — Twitter 的真正价值和对世界的贡献。

“Fractal of Rube Goldberg machines … is what it feels like understanding how Twitter works,” [Musk wrote in a short thread on Christmas Eve](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1606617504708976641). “And yet work it does … Even after I disconnected one of the more sensitive server racks.”  
“Rube Goldberg 机器的分形……就像理解 Twitter 的工作原理一样，”马斯克在平安夜的一篇短文中写道。 “但它确实起作用了……即使在我断开了一个更敏感的服务器机架的连接之后也是如此。”

Four days later, [Twitter crashed](https://www.techdirt.com/2022/12/29/it-took-just-four-days-from-elon-gleefully-admitting-hed-unplugged-a-server-rack-for-twitter-to-have-a-major-outage/). More than 10,000 users, many of them international, [submitted reports](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/29/twitter-users-report-global-outage-with-many-unable-to-log-into-website-or-app) of problems accessing the site. Some got an error message reading, “Something went wrong, but don’t fret — it’s not your fault.”  
四天后，Twitter 崩溃了。超过 10,000 名用户（其中许多是国际用户）提交了有关访问该站点的问题的报告。有些人收到一条错误消息，上面写着：“出了点问题，但别担心——这不是你的错。”

“Can anyone see this or is Twitter broken,” one user tweeted into the apparent void.  
“有人能看到这个吗，或者 Twitter 坏了，”一位用户在明显的空白处发推文。

But in that moment, Musk found that whatever might be happening in the world at large — to his site, his other companies, his reputation and legacy — that tweet, at least, appeared on his screen as intended.  
但在那一刻，马斯克发现无论世界上可能发生什么——他的网站、他的其他公司、他的声誉和遗产——至少这条推文都会按预期出现在他的屏幕上。

“Works for me,” [he replied](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1608273870901096454).  
“对我有用，”他回答道。
