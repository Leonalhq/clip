## Getting rid of television 摆脱电视

About 12 years ago I ditched my television. Anything I wanted to watch was available on the internet, and at some point a friend compared watching television to reading books, and it just felt ridiculous to watch TV ever since. His comparison went something like this:  
大约 12 年前，我放弃了电视。我想看的任何东西都可以在互联网上找到，有一次朋友把看电视比作看书，从那以后看电视就觉得很可笑了。他的比较是这样的：

“Watching television is like having a bookcase, but you don’t decide which books are in there. You have to know in advance when which book will be in your bookcase, as it’s put there by a company. You have to schedule your day so you’ll be able to read the books you want to read. When your book is available, you have to be there at the exact right moment, because the pages automatically turn. And you’ll be frequently interrupted with advertisements. You don’t know when the advertisments will be over, so you can’t really do anything else because otherwise you might be too late to continue reading when the page turns again.”  
“看电视就像有一个书架，但你无法决定里面放着哪些书。你必须提前知道哪本书会在你的书柜里，因为它是由一家公司放在那里的。你必须安排好你的一天，这样你才能读到你想读的书。当您的书可用时，您必须准时到场，因为书页会自动翻页。而且您会经常被广告打断。你不知道广告什么时候结束，所以你真的不能做任何其他事情，否则你可能来不及翻页继续阅读了。”

What a shitty bookcase. And people actually pay money to get one, and then pay a subscription fee to get the awful book reading experience.  
多么糟糕的书柜。人们实际上花钱买一本，然后支付订阅费以获得糟糕的书籍阅读体验。

So I got rid of my television. It was one of my best decisions ever.  
所以我摆脱了我的电视。这是我有史以来最好的决定之一。

I think that when I got rid of my television, I already had an ad blocker installed, or I got one soon after. And since I don’t listen to the radio, I don’t listen to ads either.  
我想当我扔掉我的电视时，我已经安装了广告拦截器，或者我很快就安装了一个。因为我不听广播，所以我也不听广告。

It’s practically impossible where I live to not be exposed to a single advertisement ever, because they are present in the physical world as well. They’re on cars, buses, billboards, etc. But I think I’ve gotten rid of 99% of them, compared to if I still lived in the city, watched television, listened to radio, and had no ad blocker.  
在我居住的地方几乎不可能不接触到任何一个广告，因为它们也存在于现实世界中。它们在汽车、公共汽车、广告牌等上。但我想我已经摆脱了 99%，相比之下，如果我仍然住在城市里，看电视，听广播，没有广告拦截器。

## What are the effects of getting rid of ads?  
去除广告有什么影响？

It’s hard to say, of course. I don’t have access to a clone of myself in a dimension where you’re forced to watch advertisements. What I _can_ say is the following:  
当然，这很难说。在你被迫观看广告的维度中，我无法访问我自己的克隆。我能说的是：

**Buying stuff is not a subject in my brain.  
买东西不是我脑子里的主题。**

Sure, I need to eat, so I think about when I’ll need to get groceries, and during the activity of buying groceries, my mind is occupied by that.  
当然，我需要吃饭，所以我想着什么时候需要买菜，在买菜的过程中，我的思绪被那个占据了。

But other than groceries, I never think about buying anything. I’ll use my computer until it breaks down in a way that I can’t get it repaired. The last time I bought shoes was when my shoes had holes in them. The last time I bought a coat was in 2019. The last time I bought pants was also in 2019, luckily they are made of some kind of stretchy material, so they can take the fat I accumulated since 2020.  
但除了杂货，我从来没有想过买任何东西。我会一直使用我的电脑，直到它坏到我无法修理为止。我最后一次买鞋是在我的鞋子破洞的时候。上次买外套是2019年，上次买裤子也是2019年，还好是有弹力的材质，可以把我从2020年开始积累的肥肉带走。

Of course, there are exceptions. If your car breaks down, you may need to get a new one. If you move to a different house, you may need to get new curtains, etc. But in general, I no longer get the impulse to buy stuff. Maybe that’s the gist of it: the _necessity_ to buy something may still be there sometime, but the _impulse_ is gone. I can’t prove it, but I think it’s because I’ve gotten rid of advertisements.  
当然，也有例外。如果您的汽车抛锚了，您可能需要换一辆新车。如果你搬到不同的房子，你可能需要买新的窗帘等等。但总的来说，我不再有买东西的冲动了。也许这就是它的要点：购买东西的必要性可能仍然存在，但冲动已经消失。我无法证明这一点，但我认为这是因为我摆脱了广告。

**I don’t think you are immune to advertisements.  
我不认为你对广告免疫。**

My mother hates advertisements more than anybody I know, but she thinks she’s immune to them because she experiences them as an annoying factor of life. She thinks ads will actually give the advertised company a negative image in her brain. Instead of asking her why she watches ads even though she thinks they’re annoying, I asked how often she thinks about buying things, other than groceries. The answer was: “A couple of times per week, sometimes a couple of times per day.”  
我的母亲比我认识的任何人都更讨厌广告，但她认为自己对广告免疫，因为她认为广告是生活中令人讨厌的因素。她认为广告实际上会给广告公司在她的脑海中留下负面印象。我没有问她为什么要看广告，尽管她认为广告很烦人，而是问她多久会考虑买些东西，而不是杂货。答案是：“每周几次，有时每天几次。”

I know this is a sample size of just 2 people, but there seems to be a correlation between watching ads and thinking about buying stuff. And I don’t know about you, but I feel like I have better usages of my time than thinking about buying stuff. And if I truly need something, I don’t need to see or hear an advertisement in order to take action.  
我知道这只是 2 人的样本量，但观看广告和考虑购买东西之间似乎存在相关性。而且我不了解你，但我觉得我的时间比考虑买东西更好。如果我真的需要什么，我不需要看到或听到广告才能采取行动。
