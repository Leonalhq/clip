> **Y**ou’re probably thinking that a talk called “Is there anything good about men” will be a short talk! Recent writings have not had much good to say about men. Titles like _Men Are Not Cost Effective_ speak for themselves. Maureen Dowd’s book was called _Are Men Necessary?_ and although she never gave an explicit answer, anyone reading the book knows her answer was no. Louann Brizendine’s book, _The Female Brain_, introduces itself by saying, “Men, get ready to experience brain envy.” Imagine a book advertising itself by saying that women will soon be envying the superior male brain!  
> 
> 你可能在想，一个名为 "男人有什么好东西吗 "的讲座将是一个简短的讲座！这是个很好的例子。最近的著作对男人没有什么好的评价。像《男人不划算》这样的书名不言自明。莫林-道德的书名为《男人有必要吗》，尽管她从未给出明确的答案，但任何阅读该书的人都知道她的答案是否定的。Louann Brizendine的书《女性的大脑》在介绍自己时说："男人，准备好体验大脑的羡慕吧。"想象一下，一本书在为自己做广告时说，女性很快就会羡慕男性的优越大脑！这是对的。
> 
> Nor are these isolated examples. Alice Eagly’s research has compiled mountains of data on the stereotypes people have about men and women, which the researchers summarized as “The WAW effect.” WAW  stands for “Women Are Wonderful.” Both men and women hold much more favorable views of women than of men. Almost everybody likes women better than men. I certainly do.  
> 
> 这些也不是孤立的例子。爱丽丝-伊格利的研究汇编了关于人们对男性和女性的刻板印象的大量数据，研究人员将其总结为 "WAW效应"。WAW代表着 "女人是美好的"。男性和女性都对女性持有比男性更有利的看法。几乎每个人都喜欢女人胜过男人。我当然喜欢。
> 
> My purpose in this talk is not to try to balance this out by praising men, though along the way I will have various positive things to say about both genders. The question of whether there’s anything good about men is only my point of departure. The tentative title of the book I’m writing is “How culture exploits men,” but even that for me is the lead-in to grand questions about how culture shapes action. In that context, what’s good about men means what men are good for, from the perspective of the system.  
> 
> 我这次演讲的目的不是试图通过赞美男人来平衡这一点，尽管在这一过程中，我将对两种性别都有各种正面的评价。男人是否有什么好东西的问题只是我的出发点。我正在写的书的暂定标题是 "文化是如何剥削男人的"，但对我来说，这也是关于文化如何塑造行动的大问题的引子。在这种情况下，男人的好处是指从系统的角度来看，男人有什么好处。
> 
> Hence this is not about the “battle of the sexes,” and in fact I think one unfortunate legacy of feminism has been the idea that men and women are basically enemies. I shall suggest, instead, that most often men and women have been partners, supporting each other rather than exploiting or manipulating each other.  
> 
> 因此，这不是关于 "性别之争"，事实上，我认为女权主义的一个不幸的遗产是男人和女人基本上是敌人的想法。我将建议，相反，在大多数情况下，男人和女人一直是合作伙伴，相互支持，而不是相互利用或操纵。
> 
> Nor is this about trying to argue that men should be regarded as victims. I detest the whole idea of competing to be victims. And I’m certainly not denying that culture has exploited women. But rather than seeing culture as patriarchy, which is to say a conspiracy by men to exploit women, I think it’s more accurate to understand culture (e.g., a country, a religion) as an abstract system that competes against rival systems — and that uses both men and women, often in different ways, to advance its cause.  
> 
> 这也不是要论证男人应该被视为受害者。我厌恶竞相成为受害者的整个想法。我当然也不否认文化对女性的剥削。但是，与其将文化视为父权制，也就是男性剥削女性的阴谋，我认为将文化（例如，一个国家，一种宗教）理解为一个抽象的系统，它与对手的系统竞争--并且利用男性和女性，往往以不同的方式，推进其事业。
> 
> Also I think it’s best to avoid value judgments as much as possible. They have made discussion of gender politics very difficult and sensitive, thereby warping the play of ideas. I have no conclusions to present about what’s good or bad or how the world should change. In fact my own theory is built around tradeoffs, so that whenever there is something good it is tied to something else that is bad, and they balance out.  
> 
> 另外我认为最好是尽可能避免价值判断。它们使关于性别政治的讨论变得非常困难和敏感，从而扭曲了思想的发挥。对于什么是好的或坏的，或者世界应该如何改变，我没有结论可以提出。事实上，我自己的理论是围绕着权衡而建立的，所以只要有好的东西，就会和其他坏的东西联系在一起，它们就会平衡。

> I don’t want to be on anybody’s side. Gender warriors please go home.

> ### Men on Top 男人在上
> 
> When I say I am researching how culture exploits men, the first reaction is usually **“How can you say culture exploits men, when men are in charge of everything?”** This is a fair objection and needs to be taken seriously. It invokes the feminist critique of society. This critique started when some women systematically looked up at the top of society and saw men everywhere: most world rulers, presidents, prime ministers, most members of Congress and parliaments, most CEOs of major corporations, and so forth — these are mostly men.  
> 
> 当我说我在研究文化如何剥削男人时，第一反应通常是 "男人掌管一切，你怎么能说文化剥削男人呢？"这是一个公平的反对意见，需要认真对待。它引用了女权主义对社会的批判。这种批判始于一些妇女系统地抬头看社会高层，看到到处都是男人：大多数世界统治者、总统、总理、大多数国会议员和议会成员、大多数大公司的首席执行官，等等--这些大多是男人。
> 
> Seeing all this, the feminists thought, wow, men dominate everything, so society is set up to favor men. It must be great to be a man.  
> 
> 看到这一切，女权主义者认为，哇，男人主宰一切，所以社会的设置有利于男人。做一个男人一定很好。
> 
> The mistake in that way of thinking is to look only at the top. **If one were to look downward to the bottom of society instead, one finds mostly men there too.** Who’s in prison, all over the world, as criminals or political prisoners? The population on Death Row has never approached 51% female. Who’s homeless? Again, mostly men. Whom does society use for bad or dangerous jobs? US Department of Labor statistics report that 93% of the people killed on the job are men. Likewise, who gets killed in battle? Even in today’s American army, which has made much of integrating the sexes and putting women into combat, the risks aren’t equal. This year we passed the milestone of 3,000 deaths in Iraq, and of those, 2,938 were men, 62 were women.  
> 
> 这种思维方式的错误在于只看上层。如果我们向下看社会的底层，就会发现那里也大多是男人。在全世界范围内，谁在监狱里作为罪犯或政治犯？死囚区的人口从未接近51%的女性。谁在无家可归？同样，大部分是男人。社会用谁来做坏事或危险的工作？美国劳工部的统计报告显示，93%的工作中死亡的人是男性。同样，谁会在战场上被杀？即使是在今天的美国军队中，它在整合性别和让妇女参加战斗方面大做文章，风险也不平等。今年，我们在伊拉克超过了3000人死亡的里程碑，其中2938人是男性，62人是女性。
> 
> One can imagine an ancient battle in which the enemy was driven off and the city saved, and the returning soldiers are showered with gold coins. An early feminist might protest that hey, all those men are getting gold coins, half of those coins should go to women. In principle, I agree. But remember, while the men you see are getting gold coins, there are other men you don’t see, who are still bleeding to death on the battlefield from spear wounds.  
> 
> 人们可以想象，在一场古老的战斗中，敌人被赶走了，城市被拯救了，归来的士兵们被淋上了金币。一个早期的女权主义者可能会抗议说，嘿，所有这些男人都得到了金币，这些金币的一半应该给女人。原则上，我同意。但请记住，当你看到的男人得到金币时，还有其他你看不到的男人，他们仍在战场上因长矛的伤口而流血致死。
> 
> That’s an important first clue to how culture uses men. Culture has plenty of tradeoffs, in which it needs people to do dangerous or risky things, and so it offers big rewards to motivate people to take those risks. **Most cultures have tended to use men for these high-risk, high-payoff slots** much more than women. I shall propose there are important pragmatic reasons for this. The result is that some men reap big rewards while others have their lives ruined or even cut short. Most cultures shield their women from the risk and therefore also don’t give them the big rewards. I’m not saying this is what cultures ought to do, morally, but cultures aren’t moral beings. They do what they do for pragmatic reasons driven by competition against other systems and other groups.  
> 
> 这是关于文化如何利用男人的第一个重要线索。文化有大量的权衡，它需要人们去做危险或有风险的事情，因此它提供大的奖励来激励人们去承担这些风险。大多数文化都倾向于在这些高风险、高回报的领域使用男性，而不是女性。我将提出这其中有重要的实用性原因。其结果是，一些男人获得了巨大的回报，而另一些男人的生活被毁，甚至被缩短。大多数文化都保护他们的女性免受风险，因此也不给她们大的回报。我并不是说这是文化在道德上应该做的，但文化不是道德的存在。他们所做的事情是出于务实的原因，在与其他系统和其他群体竞争的驱动下。
> 
> **Stereotypes at Harvard 哈佛的陈规定型观念**
> 
> I said that today most people hold more favorable stereotypes of women than men. It was not always thus. Up until about the 1960s, psychology (like society) tended to see men as the norm and women as the slightly inferior version. During the 1970s, there was a brief period of saying there were no real differences, just stereotypes. Only since about 1980 has the dominant view been that women are better and men are the inferior version.  
> 
> 我说，今天大多数人对女性持有比男性更有利的定型观念。这并不总是这样。直到20世纪60年代，心理学（像社会一样）倾向于将男性视为标准，而将女性视为稍逊的版本。在20世纪70年代，有一个短暂的时期，说没有真正的差异，只是刻板印象。只是从1980年开始，主流观点是女性更好，男性是劣质的。
> 
> The surprising thing to me is that it took little more than a decade to go from one view to its opposite, that is, from thinking men are better than women to thinking women are better than men. How is this possible?  
> 
> 令我惊讶的是，从一种观点到相反的观点，即从认为男人比女人好到认为女人比男人好，只花了十年多一点时间。这怎么可能呢？
> 
> I’m sure you’re expecting me to talk about Larry Summers at some point, so let’s get it over with! You recall, he was the president of Harvard. As summarized in _The Economist_, “Mr Summers infuriated the feminist establishment by wondering out loud whether the prejudice alone could explain the shortage of women at the top of science.” After initially saying, it’s possible that maybe there aren’t as many women physics professors at Harvard because there aren’t as many women as men with that high innate ability, just one possible explanation among others, he had to apologize, retract, promise huge sums of money, and not long afterward he resigned.  
> 
> 我相信你一定希望我在某个时候谈及拉里-萨默斯，所以让我们把它结束吧！你还记得吗？你还记得，他是哈佛大学的校长。正如《经济学人》杂志所总结的那样，"萨默斯先生因大声质疑仅凭偏见是否能解释科学界高层女性的短缺而激怒了女权主义机构"。最初他说，也许哈佛大学没有那么多的女性物理学教授是因为没有那么多的女性拥有那么高的先天能力，这只是其中一种可能的解释，之后他不得不道歉，收回，承诺提供巨额资金，不久后他就辞职了。
> 
> What was his crime? Nobody accused him of actually discriminating against women. His misdeed was to think thoughts that are not allowed to be thought, namely that there might be more men with high ability. The only permissible explanation for the lack of top women scientists is patriarchy — that men are conspiring to keep women down. It can’t be ability. Actually, there is some evidence that men on average are a little better at math, but let’s assume Summers was talking about general intelligence. People can point to plenty of data that the average IQ of adult men is about the same as the average for women. So to suggest that men are smarter than women is wrong. No wonder some women were offended.  
> 
> 他的罪行是什么？没有人指责他实际上歧视妇女。他的过失是想了一些不被允许的想法，即可能有更多具有高能力的男性。缺乏顶级女科学家的唯一可允许的解释是父权制--男人们在密谋压制女性。这不可能是能力问题。事实上，有一些证据表明，男性在数学方面的平均水平更高一些，但让我们假设萨默斯说的是一般智力。人们可以指出很多数据，成年男性的平均智商与女性的平均智商差不多。因此，认为男性比女性更聪明是错误的。难怪一些女性会被冒犯。
> 
> But that’s not what he said. He said there were more men at the top levels of ability. That could still be true despite the average being the same — if there are also more men at the bottom of the distribution, more really stupid men than women. During the controversy about his remarks, I didn’t see anybody raise this question, but the data are there, indeed abundant, and they are indisputable. There are more males than females with really low IQs. Indeed, **the pattern with mental retardation is the same as with genius**, namely that as you go from mild to medium to extreme, the preponderance of males gets bigger.  
> 
> 但这不是他所说的。他说在能力的最高水平上有更多的男人。尽管平均水平相同，但这仍然可能是真的--如果在分布的底层也有更多的男性，真正愚蠢的男性比女性多。在关于他的言论的争论中，我没有看到有人提出这个问题，但数据就在那里，确实很丰富，而且是无可争议的。真正低智商的男性多于女性。事实上，智力迟钝的模式与天才的模式相同，即当你从轻度到中度再到极端，男性的优势越来越大。
> 
> All those retarded boys are not the handiwork of patriarchy. Men are not conspiring together to make each other’s sons mentally retarded.  
> 
> 所有这些弱智的男孩都不是父权制的杰作。男人们并没有一起密谋让对方的儿子变得弱智。
> 
> Almost certainly, it is something biological and genetic. And my guess is that the greater proportion of men at both extremes of the IQ distribution is part of the same pattern. Nature rolls the dice with men more than women. **Men go to extremes more than women.** It’s true not just with IQ but also with other things, even height: The male distribution of height is flatter, with more really tall and really short men.  
> 
> 几乎可以肯定的是，这是一种生物和遗传因素。我的猜测是，在智商分布的两个极端中，男性所占的比例较大，这也是同一模式的一部分。自然界对男性的掷骰子的次数多于女性。男人比女人更喜欢走极端。不仅仅是智商，在其他方面也是如此，甚至身高也是如此。男性的身高分布更平坦，有更多真正的高个子和真正的矮个子。
> 
> Again, there is a reason for this, to which I shall return.  
> 
> 同样，这也是有原因的，我将回到这个问题。
> 
> For now, the point is that it explains how we can have opposite stereotypes. Men go to extremes more than women. Stereotypes are sustained by confirmation bias. Want to think men are better than women? Then look at the top, the heroes, the inventors, the philanthropists, and so on. Want to think women are better than men? Then look at the bottom, the criminals, the junkies, the losers.  
> 
> 现在，重点是它解释了我们如何能有相反的陈规定型观念。男人比女人更喜欢走极端。陈规定型观念是由确认性偏见维持的。想认为男人比女人好吗？那就看看那些顶尖人物、英雄、发明家、慈善家，等等。想认为女人比男人好吗？那就看看底层的人，罪犯、瘾君子、失败者。
> 
> In an important sense, **men really are better AND worse than women.**  
> 
> 在一个重要的意义上，男人真的比女人更好，也更坏。
> 
> A pattern of more men at both extremes can create all sorts of misleading conclusions and other statistical mischief. To illustrate, let’s assume that men and women are on average exactly equal in every relevant respect, but more men at both extremes. If you then measure things that are bounded at one end, it screws up the data to make men and women seem significantly different.  
> 
> 在两个极端都有更多的男性的模式会产生各种误导性的结论和其他统计上的恶作剧。为了说明这一点，我们假设男性和女性在每个相关方面的平均水平完全相同，但在两个极端都有更多的男性。如果你再去测量那些在一端有界限的东西，就会把数据搞乱，使男人和女人看起来有明显的不同。
> 
> Consider grade point average in college. Thanks to grade inflation, most students now get A’s and B’s, but a few range all the way down to F. With that kind of low ceiling, the high-achieving males cannot pull up the male average, but the loser males will pull it down. The result will be that women will get higher average grades than men — again despite no difference in average quality of work.  
> 
> 考虑一下大学里的平均分数。由于成绩膨胀，大多数学生现在都得到了A和B，但也有少数人的成绩一直下降到F。在这种低上限的情况下，成绩好的男性不能拉高男性的平均分，但失败的男性会拉低它。其结果是，女性的平均成绩将高于男性--尽管工作的平均质量没有差别。
> 
> The opposite result comes with salaries. There is a minimum wage but no maximum. Hence the high-achieving men can pull the male average up while the low-achieving ones can’t pull it down. The result? Men will get higher average salaries than women, even if there is no average difference on any relevant input.  
> 
> 工资方面则出现了相反的结果。有一个最低工资，但没有最高工资。因此，成绩好的人可以把男性的平均工资提高，而成绩差的人则不能把它降低。结果是什么？男性将获得比女性更高的平均工资，即使在任何相关的投入上没有平均差异。
> 
> Today, sure enough, women get higher college grades but lower salaries than men. There is much discussion about what all this means and what should be done about it. But as you see, both facts could be just a statistical quirk stemming from male extremity.  
> 
> 今天，确实如此，女性的大学成绩较高，但工资却比男性低。关于这一切意味着什么以及应该如何处理的问题，有很多讨论。但正如你所看到的，这两个事实可能只是源于男性极端的统计怪癖。
> 
>   
> 
> **Trading Off 交易关闭**
> 
> When you think about it, the idea that one gender is all-around better than the other is not very plausible. Why would nature make one gender better than the other? Evolution selects for good, favorable traits, and if there’s one good way to be, after a few generations everyone will be that way.  
> 
> 仔细想想，一种性别比另一种性别更全面的想法是不太可信的。为什么自然界会让一个性别比另一个更好？进化选择的是好的、有利的特征，如果有一种好的方式，几代之后，每个人都会变成那样。
> 
> But evolution will preserve differences when there is a tradeoff: when one trait is good for one thing, while the opposite is good for something else.  
> 
> 但是，当存在权衡时，进化会保留差异：当一个特征对一件事有利，而相反的特征对其他事有利时。
> 
> Let’s return to the three main theories we’ve had about gender: Men are better, no difference, and women are better. What’s missing from that list? Different but equal. Let me propose that as a rival theory that deserves to be considered. I think it’s actually the most plausible one. Natural selection will preserve innate differences between men and women as long as the different traits are beneficial in different circumstances or for different tasks.  
> 
> 让我们回到我们关于性别的三个主要理论。男人更好，没有区别，女人更好。这个列表中缺少什么？不同但平等。让我提出这一点，作为一个值得考虑的对手理论。我认为这实际上是最有道理的一个。只要不同的特质在不同的环境或不同的任务中是有益的，自然选择就会保留男性和女性之间的先天差异。
> 
> Tradeoff example: African-Americans suffer from sickle cell anemia more than white people. This appears to be due to a genetic vulnerability. That gene, however, promotes resistance to malaria. Black people evolved in regions where malaria was a major killer, so it was worth having this gene despite the increased risk of sickle cell anemia. White people evolved in colder regions, where there was less malaria, and so the tradeoff was resolved differently, more avoiding the gene that prevented malaria while risking sickle cell anemia.  
> 
> 权衡的例子。非洲裔美国人比白人更容易患镰状细胞性贫血。这似乎是由于基因上的脆弱性。然而，该基因促进了对疟疾的抵抗力。黑人在疟疾是主要杀手的地区进化，所以尽管镰状细胞贫血的风险增加，但拥有这种基因是值得的。白人在较冷的地区进化，那里的疟疾较少，因此以不同的方式解决了权衡问题，更多的是避免了预防疟疾的基因，而冒着镰状细胞贫血的风险。
> 
> The tradeoff approach yields **a radical theory of gender equality**. Men and women may be different, but each advantage may be linked to a disadvantage.  
> 
> 权衡方法产生了一种激进的性别平等理论。男性和女性可能是不同的，但每一个优势都可能与一个劣势相联系。
> 
> Hence whenever you hear a report that one gender is better at something, stop and consider why this is likely true — and what the opposite trait might be good for.  
> 
> 因此，每当你听到一个报告说某一性别在某方面更出色时，请停下来想想为什么这可能是真的--以及相反的特征可能有什么好处。
> 
>   
> 
> **Can’t Vs. Won’t 不能与不会**
> 
> Before we go too far down that path, though, let me raise another radical idea. Maybe **the differences between the genders are more about motivation than ability.** This is the difference between can’t and won’t.  
> 
> 不过，在我们在这条路上走得太远之前，让我提出另一个激进的想法。也许两性之间的差异更多的是关于动机而不是能力。这就是 "不能 "和 "不愿 "之间的区别。
> 
> Return for a moment to the Larry Summers issue about why there aren’t more female physics professors at Harvard. Maybe women can do math and science perfectly well but they just don’t like to. After all, most men don’t like math either! Of the small minority of people who do like math, there are probably more men than women. Research by Jacquelynne Eccles has repeatedly concluded that the shortage of females in math and science reflects motivation more than ability. And by the same logic, I suspect most men could learn to change diapers and vacuum under the sofa perfectly well too, and if men don’t do those things, it’s because they don’t want to or don’t like to, not because they are constitutionally unable (much as they may occasionally pretend otherwise!).  
> 
> 暂时回到拉里-萨默斯关于哈佛大学为什么没有更多女性物理学教授的问题上。也许女性可以很好地完成数学和科学，但她们只是不喜欢。毕竟，大多数男人也不喜欢数学!在少数喜欢数学的人中，男性可能多于女性。Jacquelynne Eccles的研究一再得出结论，女性在数学和科学领域的短缺反映了动机而不是能力。根据同样的逻辑，我怀疑大多数男人也能很好地学会换尿布和用吸尘器吸沙发下面的东西，如果男人不做这些事情，那是因为他们不想或不喜欢，而不是因为他们在生理上无法做到（尽管他们可能偶尔会假装不喜欢！）。
> 
> Several recent works have questioned the whole idea of gender differences in abilities: Even when average differences are found, they tend to be extremely small. In contrast, when you look at what men and women want, what they like, there are genuine differences. Look at research on the sex drive: Men and women may have about equal “ability” in sex, whatever that means, but there are big differences as to motivation: which gender thinks about sex all the time, wants it more often, wants more different partners, risks more for sex, masturbates more, leaps at every opportunity, and so on. Our survey of published research found that pretty much every measure and every study showed **higher sex drive in men**. It’s official: men are hornier than women. This is a difference in motivation.  
> 
> 最近的几项工作对能力上的性别差异的整个想法提出了质疑。即使发现了平均差异，它们往往也是非常小的。相反，当你看一下男人和女人想要什么，他们喜欢什么，就会有真正的差异。看看关于性欲的研究。男性和女性在性方面的 "能力 "可能是相等的，不管这意味着什么，但在动机方面有很大的不同：哪种性别一直想着性，更经常地想要性，想要更多不同的伙伴，为性冒更大的风险，自慰更多，抓住一切机会，等等。我们对已发表的研究的调查发现，几乎所有的测量和研究都显示男性的性欲更强。这是官方说法：男人比女人更饥渴。这是动机上的差异。
> 
> Likewise, I mentioned the salary difference, but it may have less to do with ability than motivation. High salaries come from working super-long hours. **Workaholics are mostly men**. (There are some women, just not as many as men.) One study counted that over 80% of the people who work 50-hour weeks are men.  
> 
> 同样，我提到了工资差异，但它与能力的关系可能不如与动机的关系。高薪来自于超长时间的工作。工作狂大多是男性。(也有一些女性，只是没有男性那么多。)一项研究统计，超过80%的每周工作50小时的人是男性。
> 
> That means that if we want to achieve our ideal of equal salaries for men and women, we may need to legislate the principle of equal pay for less work. Personally, I support that principle. But I recognize it’s a hard sell.  
> 
> 这意味着，如果我们想实现男女同工同酬的理想，我们可能需要立法规定少工同酬的原则。就个人而言，我支持这一原则。但我认识到这是一个难点。
> 
> Creativity may be another example of gender difference in motivation rather than ability. The evidence presents a seeming paradox, because the tests of creativity generally show men and women scoring about the same, yet through history some men have been much more creative than women. An explanation that fits this pattern is that men and women have the same creative ability but different motivations.  
> 
> 创造力可能是动机而非能力方面性别差异的另一个例子。证据显示了一个看似矛盾的现象，因为创造力的测试通常显示男性和女性的得分差不多，然而在历史上，一些男性比女性更有创造力。一个符合这种模式的解释是，男性和女性具有相同的创造能力，但动机不同。
> 
> I am a musician, and I’ve long wondered about this difference. We know from the classical music scene that women can play instruments beautifully, superbly, proficiently — essentially just as well as men. They can and many do. Yet in jazz, where the performer has to be creative while playing, there is a stunning imbalance: **hardly any women improvise. Why?** The ability is there but perhaps the motivation is less. They don’t feel driven to do it.  
> 
> 我是一名音乐家，我长期以来一直想知道这种差异。我们从古典音乐界了解到，女性可以漂亮地、精湛地、熟练地演奏乐器--基本上和男性一样好。她们可以，而且很多人都在做。然而，在爵士乐中，表演者在演奏时必须具有创造性，存在着惊人的不平衡：几乎没有妇女即兴演奏。为什么？能力是有的，但也许动力不足。她们不觉得有动力去做这件事。
> 
> I suppose the stock explanation for any such difference is that women were not encouraged, or were not appreciated, or were discouraged from being creative. But I don’t think this stock explanation fits the facts very well. In the 19<sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1">th</sup> century in America, middle-class girls and women played piano far more than men. Yet all that piano playing failed to result in any creative output. There were no great women composers, no new directions in style of music or how to play, or anything like that. All those female pianists entertained their families and their dinner guests but did not seem motivated to create anything new.  
> 
> 我想，对任何这种差异的基本解释是，妇女没有得到鼓励，或没有得到赞赏，或被劝阻不要有创造力。但我不认为这种简单的解释很符合事实。在19 <sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1">th</sup> 世纪的美国，中产阶级女孩和妇女弹钢琴的人数远远多于男性。然而，所有这些钢琴演奏都没有产生任何创造性的产出。没有伟大的女作曲家，没有音乐风格的新方向或如何演奏，或类似的东西。所有这些女钢琴家都在娱乐她们的家人和他们的晚餐客人，但似乎没有动力去创造任何新东西。
> 
> Meanwhile, at about the same time, black men in America created blues and then jazz, both of which changed the way the world experiences music. By any measure, those black men, mostly just emerging from slavery, were far more disadvantaged than the middle-class white women. Even getting their hands on a musical instrument must have been considerably harder. And remember, I’m saying that the creative abilities are probably about equal. But somehow the men were driven to create something new, more than the women.  
> 
> 同时，大约在同一时间，美国的黑人男子创造了蓝调，然后是爵士乐，两者都改变了世界体验音乐的方式。无论从哪个角度看，这些黑人男子，大多刚刚摆脱奴隶制，都比中产阶级的白人妇女处于更不利的地位。甚至让他们掌握一件乐器也一定是相当困难的。请记住，我说的是，创造能力可能是相当的。但不知何故，男人被驱使去创造新东西，比女人更多。
> 
> One test of what’s meaningfully real is the marketplace. It’s hard to find anybody making money out of gender differences in abilities. But in motivation, there are plenty. Look at the magazine industry: men’s magazines cover different stuff from women’s magazines, because men and women like and enjoy and are interested in different things.

But if evolution explains anything at all, it explains things related to reproduction, because reproduction is at the heart of natural selection. Basically, the traits that were most effective for reproduction would be at the center of evolutionary psychology. It would be shocking if these vastly different reproductive odds for men and women failed to produce some personality differences.

> 
> For women throughout history (and prehistory), the odds of reproducing have been pretty good. Later in this talk we will ponder things like, why was it so rare for a hundred women to get together and build a ship and sail off to explore unknown regions, whereas men have fairly regularly done such things? But taking chances like that would be stupid, from the perspective of a biological organism seeking to reproduce. They might drown or be killed by savages or catch a disease. For women, the optimal thing to do is go along with the crowd, be nice, play it safe. The odds are good that men will come along and offer sex and you’ll be able to have babies. All that matters is choosing the best offer. We’re descended from women who played it safe.  
> 
> 对于历史上（和史前）的女性来说，繁衍后代的几率是相当大的。在本讲座的后面，我们将思考一些问题，例如，为什么一百个女人聚在一起，建造一艘船，航行去探索未知的地区是如此罕见，而男人却相当经常地做这样的事情？但是，从一个寻求繁殖的生物体的角度来看，冒这样的风险是愚蠢的。他们可能会淹死或被野蛮人杀死，或染上疾病。对女人来说，最好的办法是随大流，做个好人，玩得安全。男人会出现并提供性服务，你就可以生孩子，这种几率是很大的。最重要的是选择最好的提议。我们是玩安全游戏的女人的后代。
> 
> For men, the outlook was radically different. If you go along with the crowd and play it safe, the odds are you won’t have children. **Most men who ever lived did not have descendants who are alive today. Their lines were dead ends**_._ Hence it was necessary to take chances, try new things, be creative, explore other possibilities. Sailing off into the unknown may be risky, and you might drown or be killed or whatever, but then again if you stay home you won’t reproduce anyway. We’re most descended from the type of men who made the risky voyage and managed to come back **rich**. In that case he would finally get a good chance to pass on his genes. We’re descended from men who took chances (and were lucky).  
> 
> 对于男人来说，前景是完全不同的。如果你随波逐流，安分守己，你很可能不会有孩子。有史以来的大多数男人都没有活到今天的后代。他们的血统是死路一条。因此，有必要抓住机会，尝试新事物，发挥创造力，探索其他可能性。航行到未知的地方可能是有风险的，你可能会淹死或被杀或其他什么，但话说回来，如果你呆在家里，无论如何你都不会繁衍。我们大多数是那种进行了冒险航行并设法回来致富的人的后代。在这种情况下，他最终会有一个很好的机会来传递他的基因。我们是那些抓住机会（并且很幸运）的男人的后代。
> 
> The huge difference in reproductive success very likely contributed to some personality differences, because different traits pointed the way to success. Women did best by minimizing risks, whereas the successful men were the ones who took chances. Ambition and competitive striving probably mattered more to male success (measured in offspring) than female. Creativity was probably more necessary, to help the individual man stand out in some way. Even the sex drive difference was relevant: For many men, there would be few chances to reproduce and so they had to be ready for every sexual opportunity. If a man said “not today, I have a headache,” he might miss his only chance.  
> 
> 繁殖成功的巨大差异很可能促成了一些性格上的差异，因为不同的特质为成功指明了方向。女性通过最大限度地减少风险而取得最大的成功，而成功的男性则是那些敢于冒险的人。雄心和竞争性的努力可能对男性的成功（以后代衡量）比女性更重要。创造力可能更有必要，以帮助男性个人在某种程度上脱颖而出。甚至性欲的差异也是相关的。对许多男人来说，繁衍后代的机会很少，因此他们必须为每一个性机会做好准备。如果一个男人说 "今天不行，我头疼"，他可能会错过他唯一的机会。
> 
> Another crucial point. The danger of having no children is only one side of the male coin. Every child has a biological mother and father, and so if there were only half as many fathers as mothers among our ancestors, then some of those fathers had lots of children.

> 另一个关键点。没有孩子的危险只是男性硬币的一个方面。每个孩子都有一个亲生母亲和父亲，因此，如果我们的祖先中父亲的数量只有母亲的一半，那么其中一些父亲就有很多孩子。

> 
> To put this in more subjective terms: When I walk around and try to look at men and women as if seeing them for the first time, it’s hard to escape the impression (sorry, guys!) that women are simply more likeable and lovable than men. (This I think explains the “WAW  effect” mentioned earlier.) Men might wish to be lovable, and men can and do manage to get women to love them (so the ability is there), but men have other priorities, other motivations. For women, being lovable was the key to attracting the best mate. For men, however, it was more a matter of beating out lots of other men even to have a chance for a mate.  
> 
> 用更主观的术语来说吧。当我四处走动，试着看男人和女人，就像第一次看到他们一样，很难摆脱这样的印象（对不起，伙计们！），女人只是比男人更令人喜爱和可爱。(我认为这解释了前面提到的 "WAW效应"。)男人可能希望成为可爱的人，而且男人能够而且确实设法让女人爱他们（所以能力是存在的），但男人有其他优先事项，其他动机。对女性来说，可爱是吸引最佳伴侣的关键。然而，对男人来说，更多的是要击败许多其他男人，甚至有机会得到一个伴侣。
> 
> **Tradeoffs again: perhaps nature designed women to seek to be lovable, whereas men were designed to strive, mostly unsuccessfully, for greatness.  
> 
> 又是权衡利弊：也许自然界设计女性是为了追求可爱，而男性被设计为努力奋斗，大多不成功，追求伟大。**
> 
> And it was worth it, even despite the “mostly unsuccessfully” part. Experts estimate Genghis Khan had several hundred and perhaps more than a thousand children. He took big risks and eventually conquered most of the known world. For him, the big risks led to huge payoffs in offspring. My point is that no woman, even if she conquered twice as much territory as Genghis Khan, could have had a thousand children. Striving for greatness in that sense offered the human female no such biological payoff. For the man, the possibility was there, and so the blood of Genghis Khan runs through a large segment of today’s human population. By definition, only a few men can achieve greatness, but for the few men who do, the gains have been real. And we are descended from those great men much more than from other men. Remember, most of the mediocre men left no descendants at all.  
> 
> 而这是值得的，尽管有 "大部分不成功 "的部分。专家们估计成吉思汗有几百个甚至可能超过一千的孩子。他冒着巨大的风险，最终征服了已知世界的大部分地区。对他来说，巨大的风险带来了后代的巨大回报。我的观点是，没有一个女人，即使她征服的领土是成吉思汗的两倍，也不可能有一千个孩子。从这个意义上说，为伟大而奋斗的人类女性没有得到这样的生物回报。对于男人来说，这种可能性是存在的，因此成吉思汗的血液流淌在今天人类的很大一部分人口中。根据定义，只有少数人能够实现伟大，但对于少数实现伟大的人来说，他们的收获是真实的。而我们是这些伟人的后代，比其他男人的后代多得多。请记住，大多数平庸的人根本没有留下任何后代。

I was sent it to review, and although I disagreed with their conclusion, I felt they had made their case well, so I advocated publishing their paper. They provided plenty of evidence. They said things like, look, men are more aggressive than women. Aggression could damage a relationship because if you hurt someone then that person might not want to be with you. Women refrain from aggression because they want relationships, but men don’t care about relationships and so are willing to be aggressive. Thus, the difference in aggression shows that women are more social than men.  
> 
> S.E. Cross和L. Madsen在提交给该杂志的一篇稿件中提出了女性更善于社交的观点。我被送去审阅，虽然我不同意他们的结论，但我觉得他们的理由很充分，所以我主张发表他们的论文。他们提供了大量的证据。他们说，看，男人比女人更有攻击性。攻击性可能会损害一段关系，因为如果你伤害了某人，那么那个人可能就不想和你在一起了。女性避免攻击性，因为她们想要关系，但男性不关心关系，所以愿意攻击性。因此，攻击性的差异表明女性比男性更善于社交。
> 
> But I had just published my early work on “the need to belong,” which concluded that both men and women had that need, and so I was worried to hear that men don’t care about social connection. I wrote a reply that said there was another way to look at all the evidence Cross and Madsen covered.

> 但是我刚刚发表了我关于 "归属感的需要 "的早期工作，其结论是男人和女人都有这种需要，因此我很担心听到男人不关心社会关系的说法。我写了一份答复，说有另一种方式来看待克罗斯和马德森所涉及的所有证据。
> 
> The gist of our view was that **there are two different ways of being social.** In social psychology we tend to emphasize close, intimate relationships, and yes, perhaps women specialize in those and are better at them than men. But one can also look at being social in terms of having larger networks of shallower relationships, and on these, perhaps, men are more social than women.  
> 
> 我们观点的要点是，有两种不同的社会方式。在社会心理学中，我们倾向于强调亲密无间的关系，是的，也许女性擅长这些，并且比男性更擅长这些。但是，我们也可以从拥有更大的浅层关系网络的角度来看待社交，在这些方面，也许男性比女性更有社交能力。
> 
> It’s like the common question, what’s more important to you, having a few close friendships or having lots of people who know you? Most people say the former is more important. But the large network of shallow relationships might be important too. We shouldn’t automatically see men as second-class human beings simply because they specialize in the less important, less satisfying kind of relationship. **Men are social too — just in a different way.**  
> 
> 这就像一个常见的问题，对你来说什么更重要，是拥有一些亲密的友谊还是拥有很多认识你的人？大多数人说前者更重要。但庞大的浅层关系网络可能也很重要。我们不应该仅仅因为男人擅长不那么重要、不那么令人满意的那种关系而自动将他们视为二等人。男人也是社会的--只是方式不同。
> 
> So we reexamined the evidence Cross and Madsen had provided. Consider aggression. True, women are less aggressive than men, no argument there. But is it really because women don’t want to jeopardize a close relationship? It turns out that in close relationships, women are plenty aggressive. Women are if anything _more_ likely than men to perpetrate domestic violence against romantic partners, everything from a slap in the face to assault with a deadly weapon. Women also do more child abuse than men, though that’s hard to untangle from the higher amount of time they spend with children. Still, you can’t say that women avoid violence toward intimate partners.  
> 
> 于是我们重新审查了克罗斯和马德森提供的证据。考虑一下攻击性。的确，女性的攻击性比男性低，这一点没有争议。但这真的是因为女性不想危及亲密关系吗？事实证明，在亲密关系中，女性有很多攻击性。女性比男性更有可能对恋爱伙伴实施家庭暴力，从打脸到用致命武器攻击。女性也比男性有更多的虐待儿童行为，尽管这很难从她们与儿童相处的更多时间中解开。尽管如此，你不能说妇女避免对亲密伴侣的暴力。
> 
> Instead, the difference is found in the broader social sphere. Women don’t hit strangers. The chances that a woman will, say, go to the mall and end up in a knife fight with another woman are vanishingly small, but there is more such risk for men. The gender difference in aggression is mainly found there, in the broader network of relationships. Because men care more about that network.  
> 
> 相反，这种差异是在更广泛的社会领域中发现的。妇女不打陌生人。比方说，一个女人去商场，最后与另一个女人发生刀战的机会微乎其微，但男人有更多这样的风险。攻击性的性别差异主要体现在那里，在更广泛的关系网络中。因为男人更关心这个网络。
> 
> Now consider helping. Most research finds that men help more than women. Cross and Madsen struggled with that and eventually just fell back on the tired cliché that maybe women don’t help because they aren’t brought up to help or aren’t socialized to help. But I think the pattern is the same as with aggression. Most research looks at helping between strangers, in the larger social sphere, and so it finds men helping more. Inside the family, though, women are plenty helpful, if anything more than men.  
> 
> 现在考虑帮助。大多数研究发现，男性比女性更乐于助人。克罗斯和马德森在这个问题上进行了斗争，最终只是回到了老生常谈的话题上，即也许女性不帮忙是因为她们没有被抚养长大，或者没有被社会化来帮忙。但我认为这种模式与攻击性是一样的。大多数研究着眼于陌生人之间的帮助，在更大的社会领域，因此它发现男性帮助更多。不过，在家庭内部，女性有很多帮助，甚至比男性更多。
> 
> Aggression and helping are in some ways opposites, so the converging pattern is quite meaningful. Women both help and aggress in the intimate sphere of close relationships, because that’s what they care about. In contrast, men care (also) about the broader network of shallower relationships, and so they are plenty helpful and aggressive there.  
> 
> 侵略和帮助在某种程度上是对立的，所以汇聚的模式是相当有意义的。女性在亲密关系的范围内既帮助又攻击，因为那是她们所关心的。相比之下，男人关心（也）更广泛的浅层关系网络，所以他们在那里有很多帮助和攻击性。
> 
> The same two-spheres conclusion is supported in plenty of other places. Playground observation studies find that girls pair off and play one-on-one with the same playmate for the full hour. Boys will either play one-on-one with a series of different playmates or with a larger group. Girls want the one-to-one relationship, whereas boys are drawn to bigger groups or networks.  
> 
> 同样的双球体结论在很多其他地方得到了支持。游乐场的观察研究发现，女孩会结伴而行，与同一个玩伴一对一地玩上整整一个小时。男孩要么与一系列不同的玩伴一对一地玩，要么与一个更大的团体玩。女孩想要一对一的关系，而男孩则被更大的群体或网络所吸引。
> 
> When two girls are playing together and the researchers bring in a third one, the two girls resist letting her join. But two boys will let a third boy join their game. My point is that girls want the one-on-one connection, so adding a third person spoils the time for them, but it doesn’t spoil it for the boys.  
> 
> 当两个女孩在一起玩时，研究人员带来了第三个女孩，两个女孩抵制让她加入。但是两个男孩会让第三个男孩加入他们的游戏。我的观点是，女孩想要一对一的联系，所以增加第三个人破坏了她们的时间，但对男孩来说却没有破坏。
> 
> The conclusion is that men and women are both social but in different ways. **Women specialize in the narrow sphere of intimate relationships. Men specialize in the larger group.** If you make a list of activities that are done in large groups, you are likely to have a list of things that men do and enjoy more than women: team sports, politics, large corporations, economic networks, and so forth.  
> 
> 结论是，男人和女人都是社会人，但方式不同。女性专攻亲密关系这一狭窄的领域。男人则专攻更大的群体。如果你列一个在大群体中进行的活动的清单，你很可能会有一个男人比女人更喜欢做的事情的清单：团队运动、政治、大公司、经济网络，等等。

> 
> Consider the common finding that women are more emotionally expressive than men. For an intimate relationship, good communication is helpful. It enables the two people to understand each other, appreciate each other’s feelings, and so forth. The more the two intimate partners know about each other, the better they can care for and support each other. But in a large group, where you have rivals and maybe enemies, it’s risky to let all your feelings show. The same goes for economic transactions. When you are negotiating the price of something, it’s best to keep your feelings a bit to yourself. And so men hold back more.  
> 
> 考虑一下常见的发现，即女性比男性更善于表达情感。对于亲密关系，良好的沟通是有帮助的。它使两个人能够理解对方，欣赏对方的感受，等等。两个亲密伙伴对彼此了解越多，他们就能更好地关心和支持对方。但在一个大群体中，你有对手，也许还有敌人，让你的所有感情表现出来是有风险的。经济交易也是如此。当你在谈判某样东西的价格时，最好把你的感情保留一点在自己身上。因此，男人要多加忍耐。
> 
> Fairness is another example. Research by Brenda Major and others back in the 1970s used procedures like this. A group of subjects would perform a task, and the experimenter would then say that the group had earned a certain amount of money, and it was up to one member to divide it up however he or she wanted. The person could keep all the money, but that wasn’t usually what happened. Women would divide the money equally, with an equal share for everybody. Men, in contrast, would divide it unequally, giving the biggest share of reward to whoever had done the most work.  
> 
> 公平是另一个例子。布伦达-梅杰和其他人在20世纪70年代的研究就使用了这样的程序。一组受试者将执行一项任务，然后实验者会说，这组人已经赚了一定数量的钱，由一个成员按他或她的意愿分配。这个人可以保留所有的钱，但这通常不是事实。妇女会平分钱，每个人都有平等的份额。相反，男人会不平等地分钱，谁干得多就给谁最大的奖励。
> 
> Which is better? Neither. Both equality and equity are valid versions of fairness. But they show the different social sphere orientation. Equality is better for close relationships, when people take care of each other and reciprocate things and divide resources and opportunities equally. In contrast, equity — giving bigger rewards for bigger contributions — is more effective in large groups. I haven’t actually checked, but I’m willing to bet that if you surveyed the _Fortune 500_ large and successful corporations in America, you wouldn’t find a single one out of 500 that pays every employee the same salary. The more valuable workers who contribute more generally get paid more. It simply is a more effective system in large groups. **The male pattern is suited for the large groups, the female pattern is best suited to intimate pairs.**  
> 
> 哪个更好？都不是。平等和公平都是公平的有效版本。但它们显示了不同的社会领域取向。平等对于密切的关系更好，当人们互相照顾，互惠互利，平等分配资源和机会。相比之下，公平--对更大的贡献给予更大的奖励--在大群体中更有效。我没有实际检查过，但我愿意打赌，如果你调查了美国财富500强中的大型成功企业，你不会发现500家企业中的任何一家向每个员工支付相同的工资。贡献更大的工人通常得到更多的报酬。在大集团中，这只是一个更有效的系统。男性模式适合于大群体，女性模式最适合于亲密的一对。
> 
> Ditto for the communal-exchange difference Women have more communal orientation, men more exchange. In psychology we tend to think of communal as a more advanced form of relationship than exchange. For example, we’d be suspicious of a couple who after ten years of marriage are still saying, “I paid the electric bill last month, now it’s your turn.” But the supposed superiority of communal relationships applies mainly to intimate relationships. At the level of large social systems, it’s the other way around. Communal (including communist) countries remain primitive and poor, whereas the rich, advanced nations have gotten where they are by means of economic exchange.  
> 
> 同理，共有-交换的差异，女性有更多的共有取向，男性更多的交换。在心理学上，我们倾向于认为共有关系是比交换关系更高级的形式。例如，我们会怀疑一对结婚十年后还在说 "我上个月付了电费，现在轮到你了 "的夫妇。但是，社区关系的所谓优越性主要适用于亲密的关系。在大型社会系统的层面上，情况恰恰相反。公有制国家（包括共产主义国家）仍然是原始的、贫穷的，而富裕的、先进的国家则是通过经济交换的方式获得了他们的位置。
> 
> There’s also the point about men being more competitive, women more cooperative. Again, though, cooperation is much more useful than competition for close relationships. What use is there in competing against your spouse? But in large groups, getting to the top can be crucial. The male preference for dominance hierarchies, and the ambitious striving to get to the top, likewise reflect an orientation toward the large group, not a dislike of intimacy. And remember, most men didn’t reproduce, and we’re mainly descended from the men who did fight their way to the top. Not so for women.  
> 
> 还有一个观点是男人更有竞争力，女人更有合作精神。不过，对于亲密关系来说，合作要比竞争有用得多。与你的配偶竞争有什么用呢？但在大群体中，达到顶峰可能是至关重要的。男性对支配地位等级制度的偏爱，以及为达到顶峰而进行的雄心勃勃的努力，同样反映了对大群体的取向，而不是对亲密关系的厌恶。请记住，大多数男人没有繁殖，而我们主要是那些通过奋斗达到顶峰的男人的后代。女性则不然。
> 
> One more thing. Cross and Madsen covered plenty of research showing that men think of themselves based on their unusual traits that set them apart from others, while women’s self-concepts feature things that connect them to others. Cross and Madsen thought that this was because men wanted to be apart from others. But in fact being different is vital strategy for belonging to a large group. If you’re the only group member who can kill an antelope or find water or talk to the gods or kick a field goal, the group can’t afford to get rid of you.  
> 
> 还有一件事。克罗斯和马德森涵盖了大量的研究，表明男人对自己的看法是基于他们与他人不同的不寻常的特征，而女人的自我概念的特点是将他们与他人联系起来。克罗斯和马德森认为，这是因为男性希望与他人不同。但事实上，与众不同是属于一个大群体的重要策略。如果你是唯一能杀死羚羊或找到水或与神灵交谈或踢球的团体成员，那么这个团体就不能摆脱你了。
> 
> It’s different in a one-to-one relationship. A woman’s husband, and her baby, will love her even if she doesn’t play the trombone. So cultivating a unique skill isn’t essential for her. But playing the trombone is a way to get into some groups, especially brass bands. This is another reason that men go to extremes more than women. Large groups foster the need to establish something different and special about yourself.  
> 
> 在一对一的关系中则不同。一个女人的丈夫和她的孩子会爱她，即使她不会吹长号。所以培养一项独特的技能对她来说并不重要。但是吹长号是进入一些团体的一种方式，特别是铜管乐队。这也是男人比女人更喜欢走极端的另一个原因。大型团体培养了建立自己的不同和特别之处的需要。

> Feminism has taught us to see culture as men against women. Instead, I think the evidence indicates that culture emerged mainly with men and women working together, but working against other groups of men and women. Often the most intense and productive competitions were groups of men against other groups of men, though both groups depended on support from women.  
> 
> 女权主义教我们把文化看成是男人对女人。相反，我认为证据表明，文化的出现主要是男人和女人一起工作，但与其他男人和女人的团体合作。通常，最激烈和最有成效的竞争是男性群体与其他男性群体的竞争，尽管这两个群体都依赖于女性的支持。
> 
> Culture enables the group to be more than the sum of its parts (its members). **Culture can be seen as a biological strategy.** Twenty people who work together, in a cultural system, sharing information and dividing up tasks and so forth, will all live better — survive and reproduce better — than if those same twenty people lived in the same forest but did everything individually.  
> 
> 文化使群体能够超越其各部分（其成员）的总和。文化可以被看作是一种生物策略。二十个人在一个文化系统中一起工作，分享信息和分配任务等等，都会比这二十个人生活在同一个森林中但各自为政的情况下生活得更好--生存和繁殖得更好。
> 
> Culture thus provides some benefit from having a system. Let’s call this “system gain,” which means how much better the group does because of the system. Think of two soccer teams. Both sets of players know the rules and have the same individual skills. One group has only that, and they go out to play as individuals trying to do their best. The other works as a team, complementing each other, playing with a system. The system will likely enable them to do better than the group playing as separate individuals. That’s system gain.  
> 
> 因此，文化为拥有一个系统提供了一些好处。我们把这称为 "系统增益"，这意味着由于系统的存在，这个群体的表现要好得多。想想两个足球队。两组球员都知道规则，并且拥有相同的个人技能。一组只有这些，他们作为个人出去比赛，试图做到最好。另一组则作为一个团队，相互补充，用一个系统进行比赛。这个系统可能会使他们做得比作为独立个体打球的那组更好。这就是系统收益。
> 
> And one vital fact is that the scope of system gain increases with the size of the system. This is essentially what’s happening in the world right now, globalization in the world economy. Bigger systems provide more benefits, so as we expand and merge more units into bigger systems, overall there is more gain.  
> 
> 而一个重要的事实是，系统收益的范围随着系统的规模而增加。这基本上就是现在世界上正在发生的事情，世界经济的全球化。更大的系统提供了更多的好处，所以随着我们的扩张和将更多的单位合并到更大的系统中，总体上会有更多的收益。
> 
> There is one crucial implication from all this. Culture depends on system gain, and bigger systems provide more of this. Therefore, you’ll get more of the benefit of culture from large groups than from small ones. A one-on-one close relationship can do a little in terms of division of labor and sharing information, but a 20-person group can do much more.  
> 
> 所有这些都有一个关键的含义。文化取决于系统收益，而更大的系统提供了更多的收益。因此，你会从大群体中获得比小群体更多的文化收益。一对一的亲密关系可以在分工和分享信息方面做一点事情，但一个20人的团体可以做得更多。

> **As a result, culture mainly arose in the types of social relationships favored by men.** Women favor close, intimate relationships. These are if anything more important for the survival of the species. That’s why human women evolved first. We need those close relationships to survive. The large networks of shallower relationships aren’t as vital for survival — but they are good for something else, namely the development of larger social systems and ultimately for culture.

> The generally accepted view is that back in early human society, men and women were close to equal. Men and women had separate spheres and did different things, but both were respected. Often, women were gatherers and men were hunters. The total contribution to the group’s food was about the same, even though there were some complementary differences. For example, the gatherers’ food was reliably there most days, while the hunters brought home great food once in a while but nothing on other days.  
> 
> 普遍接受的观点是，早在人类社会早期，男性和女性就已经接近平等。男人和女人有不同的领域，做不同的事情，但都受到尊重。通常情况下，女性是采集者，男性是猎手。对群体食物的总贡献是差不多的，尽管有一些互补的差异。例如，采集者的食物在大多数日子里都是可靠的，而猎人偶尔会带回家很好的食物，但在其他日子里什么都没有。
> 
> Gender inequality seems to have increased with early civilization, including agriculture. Why? The feminist explanation has been that the men banded together to create patriarchy. This is essentially a conspiracy theory, and there is little or no evidence that it is true. Some argue that the men erased it from the history books in order to safeguard their newly won power. Still, the lack of evidence should be worrisome, especially since this same kind of conspiracy would have had to happen over and over, in group after group, all over the world.  
> 
> 性别不平等似乎随着早期文明的发展而加剧，包括农业。为什么呢？女权主义的解释是，男人们联合起来创造了父权制。这基本上是一个阴谋论，几乎没有证据表明它是真的。有些人认为，男人们把它从历史书上抹去，以保护他们新赢得的权力。不过，缺乏证据应该是令人担忧的，特别是这种同样的阴谋必须在世界各地的一个又一个群体中反复发生。
> 
> Let me offer a different explanation. It’s not that the men pushed the women down. Rather, it’s just that the women’s sphere remained about where it was, while the men’s sphere, with its big and shallow social networks, slowly benefited from the progress of culture. By accumulating knowledge and improving the gains from division of labor, the men’s sphere gradually made progress.  
> 
> 让我提供一个不同的解释。这并不是说男人把女人推倒了。相反，只是妇女的领域仍然停留在原来的位置上，而男子的领域，以其大而浅的社会网络，慢慢地从文化的进步中受益。通过积累知识和提高劳动分工的收益，男人的领域逐渐取得了进步。
> 
> Hence religion, literature, art, science, technology, military action, trade and economic marketplaces, political organization, medicine — these all mainly emerged from the men’s sphere. The women’s sphere did not produce such things, though it did other valuable things, like take care of the next generation so the species would continue to exist.  
> 
> 因此，宗教、文学、艺术、科学、技术、军事行动、贸易和经济市场、政治组织、医学--这些都主要是由男人的领域产生的。妇女的领域没有产生这些东西，尽管它做了其他有价值的事情，比如照顾下一代，使物种继续存在。
> 
> Why? It has nothing to do with men having better abilities or talents or anything like that. It comes mainly from the different kinds of social relationships. The women’s sphere consisted of women and therefore was organized on the basis of the kind of close, intimate, supportive one-on-one relationships that women favor. These are vital, satisfying relationships that contribute vitally to health and survival. Meanwhile **the men favored the larger networks of shallower relationships. These are less satisfying and nurturing and so forth, but they do form a more fertile basis for the emergence of culture.**  
> 
> 为什么？这与男人有更好的能力或天赋或类似的东西没有关系。它主要来自不同类型的社会关系。妇女领域由妇女组成，因此是在妇女喜欢的那种密切、亲密、支持性的一对一关系基础上组织的。这些是重要的、令人满意的关系，对健康和生存有至关重要的贡献。与此同时，男性则偏爱较大的浅层关系网络。这些关系不那么令人满意，也不那么滋养人，等等，但它们确实为文化的出现形成了一个更肥沃的基础。
> 
> Note that all those things I listed — literature, art, science, etc — are optional. Women were doing what was vital for the survival of the species. Without intimate care and nurturance, children won’t survive, and the group will die out. Women contributed the necessities of life. Men’s contributions were more optional, luxuries perhaps. But culture is a powerful engine of making life better. Across many generations, culture can create large amounts of wealth, knowledge, and power. Culture did this — but mainly in the men’s sphere.  
> 
> 请注意，我列出的所有这些东西--文学、艺术、科学等--都是可有可无的。妇女在做对物种的生存至关重要的事情。没有亲密的关怀和养育，孩子们就无法生存，群体就会消亡。妇女贡献了生活的必需品。男人的贡献更多是可有可无的，也许是奢侈品。但文化是使生活更美好的强大引擎。在许多世代中，文化可以创造大量的财富、知识和权力。文化做到了这一点--但主要是在男人的领域。
> 
> Thus, the reason for **the emergence of gender inequality** may have little to do with men pushing women down in some dubious patriarchal conspiracy. Rather, it **came from the fact that wealth, knowledge, and power were created in the men’s sphere.** This is what pushed the men’s sphere ahead. Not oppression.  
> 
> 因此，性别不平等出现的原因可能与男性在一些可疑的父权制阴谋中把女性推倒没什么关系。相反，它来自这样一个事实：财富、知识和权力是在男人的领域里创造的。这就是推动男性领域发展的原因。而不是压迫。
> 
> Giving birth is a revealing example. What could be more feminine than giving birth? Throughout most of history and prehistory, giving birth was at the center of the women’s sphere, and men were totally excluded. Men were rarely or never present at childbirth, nor was the knowledge about birthing even shared with them. But not very long ago, men were finally allowed to get involved, and the men were able to figure out ways to make childbirth safer for both mother and baby. Think of it: the most quintessentially female activity, and yet the men were able to improve on it in ways the women had not discovered for thousands and thousands of years.  
> 
> 生育是一个很好的例子。还有什么能比分娩更有女人味的呢？在整个历史和史前时期，分娩是妇女领域的中心，男人被完全排除在外。男人很少或从不参加分娩，甚至也不与他们分享关于分娩的知识。但是不久前，男人终于被允许参与进来，男人们能够想出办法使分娩对母亲和婴儿都更安全。想一想：最典型的女性活动，而男性却能够以女性几千年来没有发现的方式对其进行改进。
> 
> Let’s not overstate. The women had after all managed childbirth pretty well for all those centuries. The species had survived, which is the bottom line. The women had managed to get the essential job done. What the men added was, from the perspective of the group or species at least, optional, a bonus: some mothers and babies survived who would otherwise have died. Still, the improvements show some value coming from the male way of being social. Large networks can collect and accumulate information better than small ones, and so in a relatively short time the men were able to discover improvements that the women hadn’t been able to find. Again, it’s not that the men were smarter or more capable. It’s just that the women shared their knowledge individually, from mother to daughter, or from one midwife to another, and in the long run this could not accumulate and progress as effectively as in the larger groups of shallower relationships favored by men.  
> 
> 我们不要夸大其词。在所有这些世纪中，妇女们毕竟把生育管理得很好。这个物种幸存了下来，这是底线。妇女们已经设法完成了基本的工作。至少从群体或物种的角度来看，男人增加的东西是可有可无的，是一种奖励：一些母亲和婴儿幸存下来，否则就会死亡。不过，这些改进还是显示了来自男性的社会方式的一些价值。大型网络可以比小型网络更好地收集和积累信息，因此在相对较短的时间内，男性能够发现女性未能发现的改进。同样，这并不是说男人们更聪明或更有能力。只是妇女们单独分享她们的知识，从母亲到女儿，或者从一个助产士到另一个助产士，从长远来看，这不能像男人所喜欢的较大群体的浅层关系那样有效地积累和进步。

> **What Men Are Good For 男人的好处是什么**
> 
> With that, we can now return to the question of what men are good for, from the perspective of a cultural system. The context is these systems competing against other systems, group against group. The group systems that used their men and women most effectively would enable their groups to outperform their rivals and enemies.  
> 
> 有了这些，我们现在可以从文化系统的角度回到男人有什么好处的问题。其背景是这些系统与其他系统竞争，群体与群体竞争。那些最有效地使用他们的男人和女人的群体系统将使他们的群体胜过他们的对手和敌人。
> 
> I want to emphasize three main answers for how culture uses men.  
> 
> 我想强调文化如何利用男人的三个主要答案。
> 
> First, **culture relies on men to create the large social structures** that comprise it. Our society is made up of institutions such as universities, governments, corporations. Most of these were founded and built up by men. Again, this probably had less to do with women being oppressed or whatever and more to do with men being motivated to form large networks of shallow relationships. Men are much more interested than women in forming large groups and working in them and rising to the top in them.  
> 
> 首先，文化依靠男人来创造构成它的大型社会结构。我们的社会是由大学、政府、公司等机构组成的。这些大部分都是由男性创立和建立的。同样，这可能与女性被压迫或其他方面没有关系，而与男性被激励形成大型的浅层关系网络有更大关系。男人比女人更有兴趣组建大型团体，在其中工作，并在其中升到最高层。
> 
> This still seems to be true today. Several recent news articles have called attention to the fact that women now start more small businesses then men. This is usually covered in the media as a positive sign about women, which it is. But women predominate only if you count all businesses. If you restrict the criteria to businesses that employ more than one person, or ones that make enough money to live off of, then men create more. I suspect that the bigger the group you look at, the more they are male-created.  
> 
> 这在今天看来仍然是事实。最近的几篇新闻报道呼吁关注这样一个事实，即现在妇女创办的小企业比男子多。这通常被媒体报道为关于妇女的一个积极迹象，确实如此。但是，只有当你计算所有企业时，妇女才占优势。如果你把标准限制在雇用一个人以上的企业，或者那些赚取足够的钱来维持生活的企业，那么男性就会创造更多。我怀疑你看的群体越大，他们就越是由男性创造的。
> 
> Certainly today anybody of any gender can start a business, and if anything there are some set-asides and advantages to help women do so. There are no hidden obstacles or blocks, and that’s shown by the fact that women start more businesses than men. But the women are content to stay small, such as operating a part-time business out of the spare bedroom, making a little extra money for the family. They don’t seem driven to build these up into giant corporations. There are some exceptions, of course, but there is a big difference on average.  
> 
> 当然，今天任何性别的人都可以创业，如果有的话，有一些预留和优势来帮助妇女创业。没有隐藏的障碍或阻挠，这一点从女性创业比男性多的事实中可以看出。但女性满足于保持小规模，例如在空闲的卧室里经营兼职业务，为家庭赚取一点额外的钱。她们似乎没有动力将这些企业打造成巨型企业。当然，也有一些例外情况，但平均而言有很大的差异。
> 
> Hence both men and women rely on men to create the giant social structures that offer opportunities to both. And it is clear men and women can both perform quite well in these organizations. But culture still relies mainly on men to make them in the first place.  
> 
> 因此，男人和女人都依靠男人来创造巨大的社会结构，为双方提供机会。而且很明显，男人和女人都可以在这些组织中表现得相当好。但是，文化仍然主要依靠男人来首先制造它们。
> 
>   
> 
> **The Disposable Male 一次性的男性**
> 
> A second thing that makes men useful to culture is what I call male expendability. This goes back to what I said at the outset, that cultures tend to use men for the high-risk, high-payoff undertakings, where a significant portion of those will suffer bad outcomes ranging from having their time wasted, all the way to being killed.  
> 
> 使男人对文化有用的第二件事是我称之为男性的消耗性。这又回到了我一开始说的，文化倾向于使用男性从事高风险、高回报的工作，其中相当一部分人会遭受坏的结果，从浪费时间到被杀害。
> 
> Any man who reads the newspapers will encounter the phrase “even women and children” a couple times a month, usually about being killed. The literal meaning of this phrase is that men’s lives have less value than other people’s lives. The idea is usually “It’s bad if people are killed, but it’s especially bad if women and children are killed.” And I think most men know that in an emergency, if there are women and children present, he will be expected to lay down his life without argument or complaint so that the others can survive. **On the _Titanic_, the richest men had a lower survival rate (34%) than the poorest women (46%)** (though that’s not how it looked in the movie). That in itself is remarkable. The rich, powerful, and successful men, the movers and shakers, supposedly the ones that the culture is all set up to favor — in a pinch, their lives were valued less than those of women with hardly any money or power or status. The too-few seats in the lifeboats went to the women who weren’t even ladies, instead of to those patriarchs.  
> 
> 任何读过报纸的人，每个月都会遇到几次 "甚至是妇女和儿童 "这样的短语，通常是关于被杀。这句话的字面意思是，男人的生命不如其他人的生命有价值。这种想法通常是 "如果有人被杀就不好，但如果妇女和儿童被杀就特别不好"。而我认为大多数男人都知道，在紧急情况下，如果有妇女和儿童在场，他就会被要求舍弃自己的生命，而不需要争论或抱怨，以便其他人能够生存。在泰坦尼克号上，最富有的男人的存活率（34%）低于最贫穷的女人（46%）（尽管电影中不是这样的）。这本身就很了不起。富有的、有权势的、成功的男人，那些行动者和摇摆者，据说是文化设置中都偏爱的人--在紧要关头，他们的生命价值低于那些几乎没有金钱、权力或地位的女性。救生船上太少的座位给了那些甚至不是女士的妇女，而不是给了那些元老们。
> 
> Most cultures have had the same attitude. Why? There are pragmatic reasons. When a cultural group competes against other groups, in general, the larger group tends to win out in the long run. Hence most cultures have promoted population growth. And that depends on women. **To maximize reproduction, a culture needs all the wombs it can get, but a few penises can do the job.** There is usually a penile surplus. If a group loses half its men, the next generation can still be full-sized. But if it loses half its women, the size of the next generation will be severely curtailed. Hence most cultures keep their women out of harm’s way while using men for risky jobs.  
> 
> 大多数文化都有同样的态度。为什么？有务实的原因。当一个文化群体与其他群体竞争时，一般来说，从长远来看，较大的群体往往会胜出。因此，大多数文化都促进了人口增长。而这取决于妇女。为了最大限度地繁衍后代，一种文化需要它能得到的所有子宫，但一些阴茎也能完成这项工作。通常有一个阴茎过剩。如果一个群体失去了一半的男人，下一代仍然可以是全尺寸的。但是如果它失去了一半的女性，下一代的规模就会被严重压缩。因此，大多数文化都让他们的女人远离危险，而让男人从事有风险的工作。
> 
> These risky jobs extend beyond the battlefield. Many lines of endeavor require some lives to be wasted. Exploration, for example: a culture may send out dozens of parties, and some will get lost or be killed, while others bring back riches and opportunities. Research is somewhat the same way: There may be a dozen possible theories about some problem, only one of which is correct, so the people testing the eleven wrong theories will end up wasting their time and ruining their careers, in contrast to the lucky one who gets the Nobel prize. And of course the dangerous jobs. When the scandals broke about the dangers of the mining industry in Britain, Parliament passed the mining laws that prohibited children under the age of 10 and women of all ages from being sent into the mines. Women and children were too precious to be exposed to death in the mines: so only men. As I said earlier, the gender gap in dangerous work persists today, with men accounting for the vast majority of deaths on the job.  
> 
> 这些有风险的工作超出了战场的范围。许多行当都需要浪费一些生命。例如，探索：一种文化可能会派出几十支队伍，有些人会迷路或被杀，而有些人则会带回财富和机会。研究也是如此。关于某个问题可能有十几种可能的理论，其中只有一种是正确的，所以测试那十一种错误理论的人最终会浪费他们的时间，毁掉他们的事业，与获得诺贝尔奖的幸运者形成鲜明对比。当然还有那些危险的工作。当英国采矿业的危险性丑闻爆发后，议会通过了采矿法，禁止10岁以下的儿童和所有年龄的妇女被送入矿井。妇女和儿童太珍贵了，不能在矿井中暴露于死亡：所以只有男人。正如我之前所说，危险工作中的性别差距今天仍然存在，男性占工作中死亡人数的绝大多数。
> 
> Another basis of male expendability is built into the different ways of being social. Expendability comes with the large groups that male sociality creates. In an intimate, one-to-one relationship, neither person can really be replaced. You can remarry if your spouse dies, but it isn’t really the same marriage or relationship. And of course nobody can ever really replace a child’s mother or father.  
> 
> 男性消耗性的另一个基础是建立在不同的社交方式上。消耗性伴随着男性社会性所创造的大群体而来。在一种亲密的、一对一的关系中，两个人都无法真正被取代。如果你的配偶去世，你可以再婚，但这并不是真正的婚姻或关系。当然，也没有人能够真正取代孩子的母亲或父亲。
> 
> In contrast, large groups can and do replace just about everybody. Take any large organization — the Ford Motor Company, the U.S. Army, the Green Bay Packers — and you’ll find that the organization goes on despite having replaced every single person in it. Moreover, every member off those groups knows he or she can be replaced and probably will be replaced some day.  
> 
> 相比之下，大集团可以而且确实替换了几乎所有人。以任何一个大型组织为例--福特汽车公司、美国陆军、绿湾包装工--你会发现，尽管该组织已经替换了其中的每一个人，但仍在继续。此外，这些组织的每个成员都知道他或她可以被替换，而且可能有一天会被替换。
> 
> Thus, **men create the kind of social networks where individuals are replaceable and expendable.** Women favor the kind of relationships in which each person is precious and cannot truly be replaced.  
> 
> 因此，男人创造了那种个人可以被替换和消耗的社会网络。女性则偏爱那种每个人都是宝贵的、不能真正被替代的关系。
> 
>   
> 
> **Earning Manhood 赢得男子气概**
> 
>  The phrase **“Be a man”** is not as common as it once was, but there is still some sense that manhood must be earned. Every adult female is a woman and is entitled to respect as such, but many cultures withhold respect from the males until and unless the lads prove themselves. This is of course tremendously useful for the culture, because it can set the terms by which males earn respect as men, and in that way it can motivate the men to do things that the culture finds productive.  
> 
> "做一个男人 "这句话已经不像以前那么常见了，但仍有一些感觉，即男人的身份必须要争取。每个成年女性都是女人，都有权得到尊重，但许多文化都不尊重男性，除非小伙子们证明自己。这对文化来说当然是非常有用的，因为它可以设定男性作为男人赢得尊重的条件，这样就可以激励男性做文化认为有意义的事情。
> 
> Some sociological writings about the male role have emphasized that **to be a man, you have to produce more than you consume**. That is, men are expected, first, to provide for themselves: If somebody else provides for you, you’re less than a man. Second, the man should create some additional wealth or surplus value so that it can provide for others in addition to himself. These can be his wife and children, or others who depend on him, or his subordinates, or even perhaps just paying taxes that the government can use. Regardless, you’re not a man unless you produce at that level.  
> 
> 一些关于男性角色的社会学著作强调，要成为一个男人，你必须生产超过你的消费。也就是说，男人被期望首先为自己提供服务。如果别人为你提供服务，你就不是一个男人了。第二，男人应该创造一些额外的财富或剩余价值，以便除了自己之外还能供养其他人。这些人可以是他的妻子和孩子，或其他依赖他的人，或他的下属，甚至可能只是支付政府可以使用的税收。不管怎么样，除非你的生产达到这个水平，否则你就不是一个男人。
> 
> Again, I’m not saying men have it worse than women. There are plenty of problems and disadvantages that cultures put on women. My point is just that cultures find men useful in these very specific ways. Requiring the man to earn respect by producing wealth and value that can support himself and others is one of these. Women do not face this particular challenge or requirement.  
> 
> 再说一遍，我不是说男人比女人差。有很多问题和劣势是文化加在女性身上的。我的观点是，文化认为男人在这些非常具体的方面很有用。要求男人通过生产能够养活自己和他人的财富和价值来赢得尊重就是其中之一。妇女不面临这种特殊的挑战或要求。
> 
> These demands also contribute to various male behavior patterns. The ambition, competition, and striving for greatness may well be linked to this requirement to fight for respect. All-male groups tend to be marked by putdowns and other practices that remind everybody that there is _not_ enough respect to go around, because this awareness motivates each man to try harder to earn respect. This, incidentally, has probably been a major source of friction as women have moved into the workplace, and organizations have had to shift toward policies that everyone is entitled to respect. The men hadn’t originally built them to respect everybody.  
> 
> 这些要求也促成了各种男性行为模式。野心、竞争和争强好胜很可能与这种争夺尊重的要求有关。全男性群体往往以贬低和其他做法为标志，提醒每个人没有足够的尊重，因为这种意识促使每个人更努力地去赢得尊重。顺便说一下，这可能是女性进入工作场所后产生摩擦的一个主要原因，组织不得不转向每个人都有权获得尊重的政策。男人们原本并没有把它们建成尊重每个人。
> 
> One of the basic, most widely accepted gender differences is agency versus communion. Male agency may be partly an adaptation to this kind of social life based on larger groups, where people aren’t necessarily valued and one has to strive for respect. To succeed in the male social sphere of large groups, you need an active, agentic self to fight for your place, because it isn’t given to you and only a few will be successful. Even the male ego, with its concern with proving oneself and competing against others, seems likely to be **designed to cope with systems where there is a shortage of respect** and you have to work hard to get some — or else you’ll be exposed to humiliation.  
> 
> 一个基本的、最广泛接受的性别差异是代理与共融。男性的代理权可能部分是对这种基于大群体的社会生活的适应，在那里人们不一定受到重视，人们必须努力争取尊重。要在大群体的男性社会领域取得成功，你需要一个积极的、代理的自我来争取你的位置，因为它不是给你的，只有少数人会成功。即使是男性的自我，由于其对证明自己和与他人竞争的关注，似乎也有可能被设计来应对那些缺乏尊重的系统，你必须努力工作来获得一些尊重--否则你就会受到羞辱。

> **Is That All? 这就是全部吗？**
> 
> I have not exhausted all the ways that culture exploits men. Certainly there are others. The male sex drive can be harnessed to motivate all sorts of behaviors and put to work in a kind of economic marketplace in which men give women other resources (love, money, commitment) in exchange for sex.  
> 
> 我还没有穷尽文化剥削男人的所有方式。当然还有其他方式。男性的性欲可以被利用来激励各种行为，并在一种经济市场中发挥作用，在这种市场中，男性给女性其他资源（爱、金钱、承诺）以换取性。
> 
> Cultures also use individual men for symbolic purposes more than women. This can be in a positive way, such as the fact that cultures give elaborate funerals and other memorials to men who seem to embody its favorite values. It can also be negative, such as when cultures ruin a man’s career, shame him publicly, or even execute him for a single act that violates one of its values. From Martin Luther King to Don Imus, our culture uses men as symbols for expressing its values. (Note neither of those two came out the better for it.)  
> 
> 文化也比女性更多地将男性个体用于象征性目的。这可以是一种积极的方式，例如，文化为那些似乎体现了其最喜爱的价值观的男人举行精心的葬礼和其他纪念活动。它也可以是消极的，例如，当文化毁掉一个男人的事业，公开羞辱他，甚至因为一个违反其价值观的行为而处决他。从马丁-路德-金到唐-伊姆斯，我们的文化将男人作为表达其价值观的象征。(请注意，这两个人都没有因此而变得更好）。

> **Conclusion 总结**
> 
> To summarize my main points: A few lucky men are at the top of society and enjoy the culture’s best rewards. Others, less fortunate, have their lives chewed up by it. Culture uses both men and women, but most cultures use them in somewhat different ways. Most cultures see individual men as more expendable than individual women, and this difference is probably based on nature, in whose reproductive competition some men are the big losers and other men are the biggest winners. Hence it uses men for the many risky jobs it has.  
> 
> 总结一下我的主要观点。少数幸运的人处于社会的顶端，享受着文化的最佳回报。其他人则不那么幸运，他们的生活被文化嚼碎了。文化同时利用男人和女人，但大多数文化以某种不同的方式利用他们。大多数文化认为单个男人比单个女人更容易被消耗，这种差异可能是基于自然界，在自然界的生殖竞争中，一些男人是大输家，而其他男人是最大的赢家。因此，它利用男人来做许多有风险的工作。
> 
> Men go to extremes more than women, and this fits in well with culture using them to try out lots of different things, rewarding the winners and crushing the losers.  
> 
> 男人比女人更喜欢走极端，这很符合文化的要求，利用他们来尝试很多不同的东西，奖励赢家，压制输家。
> 
> Culture is not about men against women. By and large, cultural progress emerged from groups of men working with and against other men. While women concentrated on the close relationships that enabled the species to survive, men created the bigger networks of shallow relationships, less necessary for survival but eventually enabling culture to flourish. The gradual creation of wealth, knowledge, and power in the men’s sphere was the source of gender inequality. Men created the big social structures that comprise society, and men still are mainly responsible for this, even though we now see that women can perform perfectly well in these large systems.  
> 
> 文化不是关于男人对女人。总的来说，文化的进步是由一群男人与其他男人合作和对抗而产生的。当女性专注于使物种得以生存的亲密关系时，男性则创造了更大的浅层关系网络，这些关系对生存来说不太必要，但最终使文化得以蓬勃发展。在男人的领域里逐渐创造出的财富、知识和权力是性别不平等的根源。男性创造了构成社会的大的社会结构，而且男性仍然要对此负主要责任，尽管我们现在看到女性在这些大的系统中可以表现得非常好。
> 
> What seems to have worked best for cultures is to play off the men against each other, competing for respect and other rewards that end up distributed very unequally. Men have to prove themselves by producing things the society values. They have to prevail over rivals and enemies in cultural competitions, which is probably why they aren’t as lovable as women.  
> 
> 对文化来说，最有效的办法似乎是让男人们相互竞争，争夺尊重和其他奖励，而这些奖励最终的分配是非常不平等的。男人必须通过生产社会重视的东西来证明自己。他们必须在文化竞争中战胜对手和敌人，这可能是他们不像女人那样可爱的原因。
> 
> The essence of how culture uses men depends on a basic social insecurity. This insecurity is in fact social, existential, and biological. Built into the male role is the danger of not being good enough to be accepted and respected and even the danger of not being able to do well enough to create offspring.  
> 
> 文化如何利用男人的本质取决于一种基本的社会不安全感。这种不安全感实际上是社会的、存在的和生物的。内置于男性角色中的是不够好而无法被接受和尊重的危险，甚至是无法做好而无法创造后代的危险。

> The basic social insecurity of manhood is stressful for the men, and it is hardly surprising that so many men crack up or do evil or heroic things or die younger than women. But that insecurity is useful and productive for the culture, the system.
