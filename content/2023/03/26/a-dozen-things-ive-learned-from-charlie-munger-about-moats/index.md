我对市场、技术和其他一切的看法

___

**1\. “We have to have a business with some inherent characteristics that give it a durable competitive advantage.”** Professor Michael Porter calls barriers to market entry that a business may have a “sustainable competitive advantage.” Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger call them a “moat.”  The two terms are essentially identical. Buffett puts it this way: “The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors.” A complete discussion about the nature of moats can’t be done well in a ~3,000 word blog post since it is one of the most complex topics in the business world.  For this reason, in my book on Charlie Munger I put the material on moats in an appendix since I feared readers would bog down and not focus on the more important points such as making investment and other decisions in life. But the complexity of the topic does not change the fact that to be a “know-something” investor you must understand moats. Even the fate of the smallest business like a bakery or shoe store will be determined by whether they can create some form of moat.  The small business person may not now what a moat is called but the great ones know that they must generate barriers to entry to create a profit. The underlying principle involved in moat creation and maintenance is simple: if you have too much supply of a good or service, price will drop to a point where there is no long-term industry profit above the company’s cost of capital. Michael Mauboussin, in what is arguably the best essay ever written on moats put it this way, “Companies generating high economic returns will attract competitors willing to take a lesser, albeit still attractive return, which will drive aggregate industry returns to opportunity cost of capital.” The best test of whether a moat exists is quantitative, even though the factors that create it are mostly qualitative. If a business has not earned returns on capital that substantially exceed the opportunity cost of capital for a period of years, it does not have a moat.  If a business must hold a prayer meeting to raise prices it does not have a moat. A business may have factors that may create a moat in the future, but the best test for a moat is in the end mathematical.  The five primary elements which can help create a moat are as follows: 1. Supply-Side Economies of Scale and Scope; 2. Demand-side Economies of Scale (Network Effects); 3. Brand; 4. Regulation; and 5. Patents and Intellectual Property.  Each of these five elements is worthy of an entire blog post or even a book. These elements and the phenomenon they create are all interrelated, constantly in flux and when working together in a lollapalooza fashion often create nonlinear positive and negative changes. For me, questions related to the creation, maintenance and destruction of moats are the most fascinating and challenging aspects of the business world.  There are no precise formulas or recipes that govern moats but there is enough commonality that you can get better at understanding moats over time.  

1."我们必须有一个企业具有一些固有的特点，使其具有持久的竞争优势。"迈克尔-波特教授将企业可能拥有的市场进入障碍称为 "可持续竞争优势"。沃伦-巴菲特和查理-芒格称它们为 "护城河"。 这两个术语在本质上是相同的。巴菲特是这样说的："投资的关键不是评估一个行业将对社会产生多大的影响，或者它将增长多少，而是确定任何特定公司的竞争优势，最重要的是，确定这种优势的持久性。那些周围有宽阔的、可持续的护城河的产品或服务，才是能给投资者带来回报的产品或服务。"关于护城河性质的完整讨论不可能在一篇约3000字的博文中很好地完成，因为它是商业世界中最复杂的话题之一。 出于这个原因，在我关于查理-芒格的书中，我把关于护城河的材料放在了一个附录中，因为我担心读者会陷入困境，而不去关注更重要的内容，比如在生活中做投资和其他决定。但是，这个话题的复杂性并没有改变一个事实，即要成为一个 "懂行 "的投资者，你必须了解护城河。即使是像面包店或鞋店这样最小的企业，其命运也将由他们是否能创造某种形式的护城河来决定。 小企业的人可能不知道护城河叫什么，但伟大的企业知道，他们必须创造进入壁垒以创造利润。创建和维护护城河所涉及的基本原则很简单：如果你有太多的商品或服务供应，价格将下降到没有高于公司资本成本的长期行业利润。迈克尔-莫布森（Michael Mauboussin）在可以说是有史以来关于护城河的最好的文章中这样说："产生高经济回报的公司将吸引愿意接受较低但仍有吸引力的回报的竞争对手，这将推动行业总回报达到资本的机会成本。"检验护城河是否存在的最好方法是定量的，尽管创造护城河的因素大多是定性的。如果一个企业在几年内没有获得大大超过资本机会成本的资本回报，那么它就没有护城河。 如果一个企业必须举行祈祷会来提高价格，它就没有护城河。一个企业可能有可能在未来创造护城河的因素，但对护城河的最好测试是在最终的数学中。可以帮助创造护城河的五个主要因素如下：1.供应方的规模经济和范围；2.需求方的规模经济（网络效应）；3.品牌；4.监管；和5.专利和知识产权。专利和知识产权。 这五个要素中的每一个都值得写一整篇博文，甚至是一本书。这些元素和它们所创造的现象都是相互关联的，不断地在变化，当它们以一种拉帕鲁扎的方式一起工作时，往往会产生非线性的积极和消极变化。对我来说，与护城河的创造、维护和破坏有关的问题是商业世界中最吸引人和最具挑战性的方面。 没有精确的公式或配方来管理护城河，但有足够的共性，你可以随着时间的推移更好地理解护城河。

**2\. “We’re trying to buy businesses with sustainable competitive advantages at a low – or even a fair price.”** **“Everyone has the idea of owning good companies. The problem is that they have high prices in relations to assets and earnings, and that takes all of the fun out of the game. If all you needed to do is to figure out what company is better than others, everyone would make a lot of money. But that is not the case.”** Buying a business with a moat is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for achieving financial success in a business. What Charlie Munger is saying in these sentences is that if you pay too much for a moat you will not find success. No one makes this point better than Howard Marks who writes: “Superior investors know – and buy – when the price of something is lower than it should be… most investors think quality, as opposed to price, is the determinant of whether something’s risky. But high-quality assets can be risky, and low-quality assets can be safe. It’s just a matter of the price paid for them.” Some people have this idea that value investing is only about buying cheap assets. The reality is that many assets are cheap for good reason. Genuine value investing is about buying assets at a substantial discount to their value. This is why Charlie Munger says that: **“All intelligent investing is value investing.”** What he means is: is there any type of investing whether the objective is to pay more than an asset is worth? There are some assets for which an intrinsic value can’t be computed, but that is a different question than whether an asset should be purchased at a discount to its value. Buffett writes: “The very term ‘value investing’ is redundant. What is ‘investing’ if it is not the act of seeking value at least sufficient to justify the amount paid? Consciously paying more for a stock than its calculated value — in the hope that it can soon be sold for a still-higher price — should be labeled speculation.”  

2."我们正试图以低价--甚至是公平的价格购买具有可持续竞争优势的企业。""每个人都有拥有好公司的想法。问题是，它们的价格与资产和收益的关系很高，这就把游戏的乐趣全部剥夺了。如果你需要做的就是弄清楚什么公司比其他公司好，每个人都会赚很多钱。但事实并非如此。"购买有护城河的企业是企业取得财务成功的必要条件，但不是充分条件。查理-芒格在这些句子中所说的是，如果你为护城河付出了太多，你就不会找到成功。没有人比霍华德-马克斯更能说明这一点，他写道："优秀的投资者知道--并且购买--当某物的价格低于它应该有的价格......大多数投资者认为质量，而不是价格，是某物是否有风险的决定因素。但高质量的资产可能是有风险的，而低质量的资产可能是安全的。这只是为它们支付的价格的问题。"有些人有这样的想法，认为价值投资只是为了购买廉价资产。现实是，许多资产便宜是有原因的。真正的价值投资是指以其价值的巨大折扣购买资产。这就是为什么查理-芒格说，："所有明智的投资都是价值投资"。他的意思是：是否有任何类型的投资的目标是支付超过资产的价值？有一些资产的内在价值是无法计算的，但这与是否应该以低于其价值的价格购买资产是不同的问题。巴菲特写道："'价值投资'这个词是多余的。 如果不是寻求至少足以证明所付金额的价值的行为，什么是 "投资"？有意识地为一只股票支付高于其计算价值的价格--希望它能很快以更高的价格出售--应该被称为投机。"

**3\. “You basically want me to explain to you a difficult subject of identifying moats. It reminds me of a story. One man came to Mozart and asked him how to write a symphony. Mozart replied, “You are too young to write a symphony.” The man said, “You were writing symphonies when you were 10 years of age, and I am 21.” Mozart said, “Yes, but I didn’t run around asking people how to do it.”** “**We buy barriers. Building them is tough… Our great brands aren’t anything we’ve created. We’ve bought them. If you’re buying something at a huge discount to its replacement value and it is hard to replace, you have a big advantage. One competitor is enough to ruin a business running on small margins.”** While there is no formula or recipe for creating a moat there are many common principles that can be used in trying to create or identify one. For example, Munger has said: **“In some businesses, the very nature of things cascades toward the overwhelming dominance of one firm. It tends to cascade to a winner take all result.”** On another occasion he said: **“Do you know what it would cost to replace Burlington Northern today? We are not going to build another transcontinental.”** It is important to note that there is a world of difference between creating a new moat than buying an existing one. For example, the venture capital business is fundamentally about building moats and the value investing discipline, as practiced by Munger and Buffett, is instead about buying existing moats at a discount to the intrinsic value of the business.  

3."你基本上是想让我向你解释识别护城河这一困难的课题。这让我想起了一个故事。有个人来找莫扎特，问他如何写交响乐。莫扎特回答说："你太年轻了，写不了交响乐"。那人说："你10岁的时候就在写交响乐，而我已经21岁了"。莫扎特说："是的，但我没有跑去问别人怎么做。""我们购买壁垒。建立它们是艰难的......我们伟大的品牌不是我们创造的。我们已经买了它们。如果你以巨大的折扣购买某样东西，而它的替代价值又很难被取代，你就有很大的优势。一个竞争者就足以毁掉一个靠微利经营的企业。"虽然没有创造护城河的公式或配方，但在试图创造或确定护城河时，有许多共同的原则可以使用。例如，芒格曾说过："在一些企业中，事情的本质是朝着一家公司的压倒性优势串联的。它往往会串联成一个赢家通吃的结果。"在另一个场合，他说"你知道今天取代伯灵顿北方公司需要多少钱吗？我们不打算再建一个横贯大陆的公司。"值得注意的是，创造一个新的护城河与购买一个现有的护城河有天壤之别。例如，风险投资业务从根本上说就是建造护城河，而芒格和巴菲特实行的价值投资纪律则是以企业内在价值的折扣购买现有的护城河。

**4\. “The only duty of corporate executive is to widen the moat. We must make it wider. Every day is to widen the moat. We gave you a competitive advantage, and you must leave us the moat. There are times when it’s too tough.  But your duty should be to widen the moat. I can see instance after instance where that isn’t what people do in business. One must keep their eye on the ball of widening the moat, to be a steward of the competitive advantage that came to you.”** What Charlie Munger is saying in these sentences is that operational excellence in running a business is very important, but the factors that maintain the barriers to entry of the business must also receive proper attention by management. For example, if the moat of a business is based on network effects or intellectual property those factors can’t be ignored. Sometimes playing defense is needed in whole or in part, as was the case when Facebook bought several potential moat destroyers. The Instagram, Oculus and WhatsApp acquisitions were in no small part designed to widen the existing Facebook moat. Of course, the companies were bought to create new moats too, so in that sense they served two purposes (i.e., the acquisitions served both offensive and defensive purposes for Facebook). Startups potentially have an asymmetrical advantage since often they are bought by incumbents just for defensive reasons (i.e., sometimes in an acquisition only consumers benefit since the new service or good is all, or nearly all, consumer surplus).  

  

4."企业行政人员的唯一职责是拓宽护城河。我们必须使它更宽。每一天都是在拓宽护城河。我们给了你竞争优势，你必须把护城河留给我们。有的时候，这太艰难了。 但你的职责应该是拓宽护城河。我可以看到一个又一个的例子，人们在商业上不是这样做的。查理-芒格在这些句子中所说的是，在经营一个企业时，卓越的运营是非常重要的，但维持企业进入壁垒的因素也必须得到管理层的适当关注。例如，如果一个企业的护城河是基于网络效应或知识产权，这些因素就不能被忽视。有时需要全部或部分地进行防御，就像Facebook收购几个潜在的护城河破坏者时的情况。对Instagram、Oculus和WhatsApp的收购，在很大程度上是为了扩大Facebook现有的护城河。当然，收购这些公司也是为了创造新的护城河，所以从这个意义上说，它们有两个目的（即，这些收购对Facebook来说既有进攻的目的，也有防守的目的）。初创企业有潜在的不对称优势，因为它们经常被在位者收购，只是为了防御的原因（即，有时在收购中只有消费者受益，因为新的服务或商品是所有或几乎所有的消费者剩余）。

**5\. “How do you compete against a true fanatic? You can only try to build the best possible moat and continuously attempt to widen it.”**  The job of a businessperson is to try to create product or service which are sufficiently unique that constraints are placed on  other companies who desire to provide a competing supply of those goods or services. For this reason moat creation and maintenance is a key part of the strategy of any business. What this means is that the essential task of anyone involved in establishing a strategy for a business is defining how a business can be unique. Creating a business strategy is fundamentally about making choices.  It is not just what you do, but what you choose not to do, that defines an effective strategy. Professor Michael Porter argues that doing what everyone must do in a business is operational effectiveness and not strategy.  The people who most often create unique compelling offerings for customers are true fanatics. Jim Sinegal of Costco is just such a fanatic which is why Charlie Munger serves on their board.  Going down the list of Berkshire CEOs reveals a long list of fanatics.  

  

5."你如何与一个真正的狂热者竞争？你只能努力建立最好的护城河，并不断尝试扩大它。" 企业家的工作是努力创造足够独特的产品或服务，以限制那些希望提供这些产品或服务的其他公司的竞争性供应。由于这个原因，护城河的创建和维护是任何企业战略的关键部分。这意味着，任何参与制定企业战略的人的基本任务都是确定企业如何才能做到独一无二。创建一个企业战略从根本上说就是要做出选择。 决定一个有效战略的不仅仅是你做什么，还有你选择不做什么。迈克尔-波特教授认为，在企业中做每个人都必须做的事情是运营效率，而不是战略。 最常为顾客创造独特的、令人信服的产品的人是真正的狂热者。好市多的Jim Sinegal就是这样一个狂热者，这也是查理-芒格在其董事会任职的原因。 沿着伯克希尔公司首席执行官的名单往下看，会发现一长串的狂热者。

**6\. “Frequently, you’ll look at a business having fabulous results. And the question is, ‘How long can this continue?’ Well, there’s only one way I know to answer that. And that’s to think about why the results are occurring now – and then to figure out what could cause those results to stop occurring.”** This set of sentences is an example of Charlie Munger applying his inversion approach. He believes that when you have a hard problem to solve the best solution often appears when you invert the problem.  For example, Munger applies the inversion process to moat analysis. Instead of just looking at why a moat exists or can be made stronger, he is saying you should think about why it may weaken. He is looking for sources of unique insight that might have been missed by others who may be too optimistic. Not being too optimistic is consistent with his personality. Munger has called himself a “cheerful pessimist.” Over time the forces of competitive destruction will inevitably weaken any moat. Munger has said: “**It is a rare business that doesn’t have a way worse future than a past.”** **“Capitalism is a pretty brutal place.” “Over the very long term, history shows that the chances of any business surviving in a manner agreeable to a company’s owners are slim at best.”** Bill Gates describes what Berkshire is looking for in a business as follows: “\[they\] talk about looking for a company’s moat — its competitive advantage — and whether the moat is shrinking or growing.”  

6."经常，你会看到一个企业有神话般的结果。而问题是，'这能持续多久？嗯，我知道只有一种方法可以回答这个问题。那就是思考为什么现在会出现这样的结果--然后再想一想什么会导致这些结果停止出现。"这组句子是查理-芒格应用其反转方法的一个例子。他认为，当你有一个难以解决的问题时，最好的解决方案往往在你反转问题时出现。 例如，芒格将反转过程应用于护城河分析。他说，你应该考虑为什么护城河存在或可以变得更强，而不是只看护城河存在的原因，而是应该考虑为什么它可能会减弱。他正在寻找那些可能被其他过于乐观的人所忽略的独特见解的来源。不太乐观与他的性格是一致的。芒格曾称自己是一个 "开朗的悲观主义者"。随着时间的推移，竞争破坏的力量将不可避免地削弱任何护城河。芒格曾说："这是一个罕见的企业，它的未来比过去更糟糕。"资本主义是一个相当残酷的地方。""从长远来看，历史表明，任何企业以公司所有者同意的方式生存的机会充其量是很小的。"比尔-盖茨这样描述伯克希尔在企业中寻找的东西："\[他们\]谈论寻找一个公司的护城河--它的竞争优势--以及护城河是在缩小还是在增长。"

**7\. “Kellogg’s and Campbell’s moats have also shrunk due to the increased buying power of supermarkets and companies like Wal-Mart. The muscle power of Wal-Mart and Costco has increased dramatically.”**  Wholesale transfer pricing power, also sometimes called supplier bargaining power (e.g., in the Michael Porter five forces model) is a potential destroyer of moats. Understanding who has pricing power in a value chain is a critical task for any manager. As an example of a moat being attacked in this way, the venture capitalist Chris Dixon wrote once about a chain of events in the gaming industry : “In Porter’s framework, Zynga’s strategic weakness is extreme supplier concentration – they get almost all their traffic from Facebook. It is in Facebook’s economic interest to extract most of Zynga’s profits, leaving them just enough to keep investing in games and advertising.” As another example, most every restaurant which does not own its building faces this same wholesale transfer pricing problem.  If you have an exclusive supplier of a necessary input, that supplier controls your profits. It is wise to have multiple suppliers of any good or service, at least potentially.  

  

7."由于超市和沃尔玛等公司购买力的增加，凯洛格和金宝的护城河也缩小了。沃尔玛和好市多的肌肉力量已经急剧增加"。 批发转让定价权，有时也被称为供应商议价权（例如，在迈克尔-波特五力模型中），是护城河的潜在破坏者。了解谁在价值链中拥有定价权是任何管理者的一项关键任务。作为一个护城河被这样攻击的例子，风险资本家克里斯-迪克森曾经写过关于游戏行业的一连串事件："在波特的框架中，Zynga的战略弱点是供应商极端集中--他们几乎所有的流量都来自Facebook。榨取Zynga的大部分利润符合Facebook的经济利益，留给他们的利润只够继续投资于游戏和广告。"作为另一个例子，大多数不拥有自己建筑的餐厅都面临着这种同样的批发转让定价问题。 如果你有一个必要投入的独家供应商，该供应商就会控制你的利润。任何货物或服务有多个供应商是明智的，至少是潜在的。

**8\. “What happened to Kodak is a natural outcome of competitive capitalism.” “The perfect example of Darwinism is what technology has done to businesses. When someone takes their existing business and tries to transform it into something else—they fail. In technology that is often the case. Look at Kodak: it was the dominant imaging company in the world. They did fabulously during the great depression, but then wiped out the shareholders because of technological change. Look at General Motors Company, which was the most important company in the world when I was young. It wiped out its shareholders. How do you start as a dominant auto company in the world with the other two competitors not even close, and end up wiping out your shareholders? It’s very Darwinian—it’s tough out there. Technological change is one of the toughest things.”** I don’t know of any business in today’s business world that does not face significant disruptive threats. None. It is brutally competitive to be involved any business today. Do some businesses have moats that make their lines of business relatively more profitable? Sure. But I can’t think of any business which is not under attack right now. When I say every business is competitive in todya’s world I mean every business. Life as the owner of a sandwich shop, a food processor, marketing consultancy, etc. is inevitably tough. Pricing power in the business world today is rarer than a Dodo bird. Technology businesses present a special case when it comes to moats since disruptive change is much more likely to be nonlinear. Businesses in the technology sector that seem relatively solid can disappear in the blink of an eye. The factors like network effects that can create startling success for a technology company can be just as powerful on the way down as they were the way up.  

  

8."柯达公司的遭遇是竞争性资本主义的自然结果。""达尔文主义的完美例子是技术对企业所做的一切。当有人把他们现有的业务，并试图把它改造成别的东西--他们就会失败。在技术方面，情况往往是这样的。看看柯达：它是世界上占主导地位的成像公司。他们在大萧条期间业绩惊人，但后来由于技术变革，股东们都被消灭了。看看通用汽车公司，在我年轻时它是世界上最重要的公司。它消灭了它的股东。你是如何开始成为世界上占主导地位的汽车公司，而其他两个竞争者甚至没有接近，最终消灭了你的股东？这是非常达尔文式的--在那里很艰难。技术变革是最艰难的事情之一。"我不知道在今天的商业世界中，有哪个企业不面临重大的颠覆性威胁。没有。今天参与任何业务的竞争都是残酷的。一些企业是否有护城河，使其业务线相对更有利可图？当然，但我想不出有哪家企业现在没有受到攻击。当我说每个企业在当今世界都有竞争时，我是指每个企业。作为一家三明治店、一家食品加工厂、营销咨询公司等的老板，生活难免艰难。在今天的商业世界里，定价权比渡渡鸟还要稀少。说到护城河，科技企业是一个特殊的例子，因为破坏性的变化更可能是非线性的。技术领域的企业看起来相对稳固，但在眨眼间就会消失。 能够为科技公司创造惊人成功的网络效应等因素，在下降过程中可能和上升过程中一样强大。

**9.  “The perfectly fabulous economics of this \[newspaper\] business could become grievously impaired.”** The newspaper business once had a strong moat created by economies of scale inherent in huge printing plants and large distribution networks needed for physical newspapers. The Internet has caused the moats of newspapers to quickly atrophy, which is problematic for owners and society as a whole given that the news itself is what is called a “public good” (i.e., non-rival and non-excludable). Charlie Munger has lamented the decline of newspapers: **“It’s not good for the country. We’re losing something.”** Buffett has said it “blows your mind” how quickly the newspaper industry has declined. The way commentators on the financial prospects of newspapers ignore the public good problems is amazing really.  Increasing something like quality does not fix a public good problem. Without some scarcity/a moat there will be no ability on the part of newspapers to generate a profit.  Solutions to journalism business model problems are likely to include philanthropy as is the case with other public goods.  

  

9\. "这个\[报纸\]业务的完美经济性可能会受到严重损害。"报业曾经有一条强大的护城河，它是由实体报纸所需的巨大印刷厂和大型发行网络所固有的规模经济创造的。互联网使报纸的护城河迅速萎缩，鉴于新闻本身就是所谓的 "公共产品"（即非竞争性和非排他性），这对报纸所有者和整个社会都是有问题的。查理-芒格（Charlie Munger）曾对报纸的衰落表示叹息："这对国家来说不是好事。我们正在失去一些东西"。巴菲特曾说过，报纸业衰落的速度之快 "让人吃惊"。关于报纸财务前景的评论家们忽视了公共利益问题，这真是令人惊讶。 提高像质量这样的东西并不能解决公益问题。没有一些稀缺性/护城河，报纸就没有能力创造利润。 解决新闻业商业模式问题的方法很可能包括慈善事业，就像其他公共产品的情况一样。

**10.“Network TV \[in its heyday,\] anyone could run and do well. If Tom Murphy is running it, you’d do very well, but even your idiot nephew could do well.”** Some moats are so strong that even a weak management teams can prosper running the business. The broadcast television moat is not what it once was given the rise of things like over the top viewing. But at one time television had a bullet proof moat. Buffett believes: “When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.” Munger certainly wants a business in which he invests to be run by capable and trustworthy managers. Operational excellence is always desired. But having a moat is a protection against a poor manager running a business into the ground. Buffett said once:  “Buy into a business that’s doing so well an idiot could run it, because sooner or later, one will.”   

10\. "网络电视\[在其全盛时期，\]任何人都可以运行并做得好。如果汤姆-墨菲在经营它，你会做得很好，但即使是你的白痴侄子也能做得很好。"有些护城河是如此强大，以至于即使是一个弱小的管理团队也能在经营业务上获得成功。鉴于过度收视等现象的出现，广播电视的护城河已经今非昔比。但电视曾一度有一条防弹护城河。巴菲特认为："当一个以辉煌著称的管理层处理一个以糟糕的经济状况著称的企业时，保持不变的是企业的声誉。"芒格当然希望他投资的企业是由有能力的、值得信赖的管理者来经营。优秀的运营始终是人们所期望的。但是，拥有护城河是一种保护，以防止一个糟糕的经理人将企业经营得一塌糊涂。巴菲特曾经说过："买入一家生意好得连白痴都能经营的企业，因为迟早有一天会有人来经营。"

**11\. “I think it’s dangerous to rely on special talents — it’s better to own lots of monopolistic businesses with unregulated prices. But that’s not the world today.”** In these sentences Charlie Munger uses a term that Peter Thiel likes to use when referring to a moat: “monopoly. While it is certainly profitable to own an unregulated monopoly, the number of businesses today that have moats which can be considered a monopoly is vanishingly small.  For this reason I think Peter Thiel takes the monopoly point too far.  The word monopoly is loaded and carries too much baggage to be useful. The reality is that the nature of moats is not binary. Moats come in all varieties, from strong to weak. They are always in flux and vary on multiple dimensions. For example, some big moats are more brittle than others. Some moats protect valuable market segments and some do not. In other words, moats can be classified along a spectrum from strong to weak, valuable to non valuable and from big to small.  

11."我认为依靠特殊人才是危险的--最好是拥有大量的垄断性企业，价格不受管制。但这不是今天的世界。"在这些句子中，查理-芒格使用了彼得-蒂尔在提到护城河时喜欢使用的一个术语："垄断。虽然拥有不受管制的垄断肯定是有利可图的，但今天拥有护城河的企业中，可以被认为是垄断的企业数量少得惊人。 出于这个原因，我认为彼得-蒂尔把垄断这一点说得太远了。 垄断这个词很有分量，带有太多的包袱，没有用处。现实是，护城河的性质不是二元的。护城河有各种类型，从强到弱都有。它们总是在不断变化，并在多个方面有所不同。例如，一些大的护城河比其他的更脆弱。有些护城河能保护有价值的细分市场，有些则不能。换句话说，护城河可以按照从强到弱、从有价值到无价值、从大到小进行分类。

**12\. “The informational advantage of brands is hard to beat.  And your advantage of scale can be an informational advantage. If I go to some remote place, I may see Wrigley chewing gum alongside Glotz’s chewing gum. Well, I know that Wrigley is a satisfactory product, whereas I don’t know anything about Glotz’s. So if one is $.40 and the other is $.30, am I going to take something I don’t know and put it in my mouth – which is a pretty personal place, after all – for a lousy dime? So, in effect, Wrigley, simply by being so well-known, has advantages of scale – what you might call an informational advantage. Everyone is influenced by what others do and approve.  Another advantage of scale comes from psychology. The psychologists use the term ‘social proof’. We are all influenced – subconsciously and to some extent consciously – by what we see others do and approve. Therefore, if everybody’s buying something, we think it’s better. We don’t like to be the one guy who’s out of step. Again, some of this is at a subconscious level and some of it isn’t. Sometimes, we consciously and rationally think, ‘Gee, I don’t know much about this. They know more than I do. Therefore, why shouldn’t I follow them?’ All told, your advantages can add up to one tough moat.”** The most important point made in these sentences by Charlie Munger is that the great moats which exist in the world tend to have an aggregate value that is more than the sum of the parts. Munger calls this a “lollapalooza” outcome. Others may refer to it as synergy. As an example, many moats in the technology business are based on what Munger calls an informational advantage, but there can be many other factors like economies of scale or intellectual property that feed back on each other to create and strengthen the moat.  

12."品牌的信息优势是难以超越的。 而你的规模优势也可以成为信息优势。如果我去某个偏远的地方，我可能会看到箭牌口香糖和Glotz的口香糖在一起。那么，我知道箭牌是一个令人满意的产品，而我对Glotz's却一无所知。所以，如果一个是4美元，另一个是3美元，我是否会为了一个糟糕的1美元而把我不知道的东西放进嘴里--毕竟这是一个相当私人的地方？因此，实际上，箭牌公司仅仅因为其知名度高而具有规模优势--你可以称之为信息优势。每个人都会受到其他人的行为和认可的影响。 另一个规模优势来自于心理学。心理学家们使用了 "社会证明 "这一术语。我们都会受到影响--潜意识的，在某种程度上是有意识的--我们看到别人做什么，认可什么。因此，如果大家都在买东西，我们就认为它更好。我们不喜欢成为那个不合群的人。同样，这其中有些是在潜意识层面，有些不是。有时，我们有意识地、理性地想：'哎呀，我对这个不太了解。他们比我知道得更多。因此，我为什么不跟随他们呢？总而言之，你的优势加起来可以成为一条艰难的护城河。"查理-芒格在这些句子中提出的最重要的一点是，世界上存在的伟大的护城河往往具有超过各部分之和的总价值。芒格称这是一种 "lollapalooza "结果。其他人可能把它称为协同作用。举例来说，技术行业的许多护城河是基于芒格所说的信息优势，但也可能有许多其他因素，如规模经济或知识产权，它们相互反馈，创造并加强护城河。

I am at ~3,400 words in this post and if you are still reading the probability is good that you understand or soon will understand this critical aspect of investing called “moats.” The opportunities to learn never end. I think is the best game on Earth and that fact explains why Munger and Buffett love what they do so much that they plan to continue to be investors as long as they are physiologically able to do so.  Here’s Buffett to finish this post off:  

我在这篇文章中写了~3,400字，如果你还在阅读，那么你很有可能了解或很快就会了解投资的这个关键方面，即 "护城河"。学习的机会永无止境。我认为这是地球上最好的游戏，这一事实解释了为什么芒格和巴菲特如此热爱他们的工作，以至于他们计划继续做投资者，只要他们在生理上能够这样做。 下面是巴菲特为这篇文章画上的句号：

“I will say this about investing: Everything you do earn is cumulative. That doesn’t mean that industries stay good forever, or businesses stay good forever, but in learning to think about business models, what I learned at 20 is useful to me now. What I learned at 25 is useful to me now. It’s like physics. There are underlying principles, but now they’re doing all kinds of things with physics they weren’t doing 50 years ago.  

But if you’ve got the principles, if you know what makes a good business, if you know what makes a good manager, if you know what makes a good product, and you learn that in one business, there is some transference to other businesses.”  

"关于投资，我想说的是：你所赚取的一切都会累积起来。这并不意味着行业永远好，或企业永远好，但在学习思考商业模式方面，我在20岁时学到的东西现在对我有用。我在25岁时学到的东西现在也对我有用。这就像物理学。有一些基本的原则，但现在他们在用物理学做各种事情，而这些事情在50年前是做不到的。但是，如果你已经掌握了原则，如果你知道什么是好的企业，如果你知道什么是好的经理人，如果你知道什么是好的产品，并且你在一个企业里学到了这些，就会有一些转移到其他企业。
